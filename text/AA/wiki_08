Samoe Damapong came from a family of Lao origin; his paternal grandfather was an Isan Lao from Nong Khai while his maternal grandmother was a princess of the Na Champassak family. Potjaman and Thaksin married in July 1976, and they went on to have one son, Panthongtae, a businessman, and two daughters, Pinthongta and Paetongtarn. In the late 1970s and 1980s Potjaman worked with Thaksin to develop his various commercial ventures.\n\nOn January 23, 2006, the Shinawatra family sold their entire stake in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings. The Shinawatra and Damapong families netted about 73 billion baht tax-free from the sale, using a regulation that made individuals who sell shares on the stock exchange exempt from capital gains tax.\n\nThe Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the transaction and cleared the entire family from wrongdoing, except for Potjaman's son, Panthongtae. The SEC did find that Panthongtae committed minor infractions with regard to information disclosure and public tender offers in transactions between 2000 and 2002. \nHe was fined 6 million THB (about 150,000USD). Allegations of insider trading by Potjaman, other Shinawatra family members, Shin Corporation Corp executives, and major shareholders were also investigated. No irregularities were found. On 21 September 2006, the Revenue Department sent a letter to the Shinawatras advising the Shinawatra family not to pay taxes on the transaction. Also in 2006, Revenue Department Director-General Sirot Sawadpanish testified to the military junta's Assets Examination Committee that the transaction was not taxable. The junta investigated Sirot and 6 other senior Ministry of Finance officials for their role in dispensing legal advice regarding the transaction. The AEC demanded that Potjaman testify to the Committee, and threatened to jail her if she did not.\n\nAfter Thaksin was deposed by a military coup, the junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee accused her of irregularities in the purchase of government-owned land. However, the Bank of Thailand, which supervised the sale of the land, claimed that the sale was conducted properly.\n\nIn January 2007, the Financial Institutions Development Fund complied with the Assets Examination Committee request to file a charge against Thaksin and his wife over their purchase of four 772 million baht plots of land from the FIDF in 2003. The charge was based on alleged violation of Section 100 of the National Counter Corruption Act, which specifies that government officials and their spouses are prohibited from entering into or having interests in contracts made with state agencies under their authorisation. However, Section 4 of the Act indicates that persons committing malfeasance must be direct supervisors of the damaged party - in this case, the FIDF. At the time, Bank of Thailand Governor Pridiyathorn Devakula directly supervised the FIDF, not Thaksin. Section 29 of the Bank of Thailand Act of 1942 stated that the Prime Minister did not have jurisdiction to oversee the FIDF, because those managing the fund had sole authority for policies, control, oversight and regulations governing the agency. Pridiyathorn's testimony to the court occurred in secret - Thaksin's legal team was not allowed in the room. The FIDF later noted that the land was sold to the Shinawatras at a price greater than its appraised value. The case went to the Supreme Court 10 July 2007.\n\nOn 21 October 2008, the Supreme Court of Thailand's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions delivered a verdict on the Ratchadaphisek Land purchasing case, ruling that:\n\nAs Thaksin and wife defended themselves that the FIDF was not an administrative agency or state enterprise, and Thaksin, as the Prime Minister, had no powers and duties to supervise, scrutinise or monitor the Fund, resulting that the land purchasing case was not a conflict of interest.\n\nThe Court: By unanimous resolution, holding that the Fund was the administrative agency under Section 100, Subsection (1), of the National Counter Corruption Organic Act, BE 2542 (1997). By 6:3, holding that Thaksin was a \"de facto\" supervisor of the Fund. By 7:2, holding that Potjaman was not a holder of political position or public authority prohibited under Section 122 of the Organic Act. And by unanimous resolution, holding that the purchased land and all other properties gained in this case could not be seized under Section 33, Subsection 1 and Subsection 2 of the Criminal Code.\n\nTherefore, Thaksin was found guilty of abusing his power to help his wife purchasing the land at a knock-down price, being sentenced to two years in imprisonment. All accusations against Potjaman in the case shall lapse together with the arrest warrant whereof. However, as Thaksin was dwelling aboard, the arrest warrant was issued to bring him back to the domestic punishment.\n\nSoon after the verdict was handed down, Thaksin gave a telephone interview to Reuters, stating he had expected the imprisonment term. He was quoted as remarking that \"I have been informed of the result. I had long anticipated that it would turn out this way,\" and adding that the case was politically motivated.\n\nThaksin Shinawatra's wife Pojaman Shinawatra, 51, who was found guilty on July 31, 2008, and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment, was released on 5 million baht bail. Bangkok Criminal Court Judge Pramote Pipatpramote also convicted her adopted brother Bhanapot Damapong, and her secretary: \"The three defendants have high economic and social status. But, they were working together to avoid taxes, even though the taxes amounted to little compared to their assets.\"\n\nOn August 10, 2008, Thaksin and his wife Khunying Potjaman flew to London from Beijing, where he had been attending the 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony. In doing so he violated the terms of his bail. Thaksin said that it was his wish to return to Thailand someday, but claimed it was not currently safe enough for him and his family. Thaksin announced his intention to seek political asylum in Britain. His 3 children had reportedly flown ahead to Britain. Meanwhile, Thailand's Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant for both Thaksin and his wife for jumping bail.\n\nThai Supreme Commander Gen. Boonsrang Niempradit and opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva accused Thaksin of hurting Thailand and damaging its reputation: \"His Majesty the King recognizes highly the importance of the judiciary … The public should follow him.\"\n\nOn September 17, Chief Justice Thonglor Chom-ngarm and the judges unanimously postponed the reading of the verdict to October 21 at 2 pm, and issued the fresh arrest warrant for Thaksin and his wife, Pojaman.\n\nOn November 10, 2008, the Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines) Undersecretary Franklin Ebdalin stated \"the government would 'politely' turn down any request for political refuge from the fugitive Thai leader, xxx due to Manila’s “friendly” relations with Bangkok. If an applicant for political asylum insists, the first thing the friendly country customarily does is to send him back to his home country. The Department of Foreign Affairs had not received “feelers” that Thaksin wanted haven in the Philippines. Of course, he wouldn’t want to be embarrassed, that’s why I don’t think he would make such a request. He’s no ordinary figure. He’s a former prime minister of Thailand.” Amid Thai newspapers' reports that Thaksin may land in Manila, his brother-in-law, Somchai Wongsawat, was set to arrive for a scheduled state visit on November 10 with Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (bilateral meeting on regional global financial crisis).\n\nThe British Government Home Office revoked Potjaman Shinawatra and Thaksin's visas, while the Bangkok British Embassy e-mailed airlines advisory directing them to disallow Thaksin or his wife from boarding flights to the United Kingdom. But Thaksin's spokesman, Phongthep Thepkanjana, said: \"I spoke with Thaksin's secretary and he said that Thaksin still had not been notified by the British government.\" Thaksin was reported to be travelling in East Asia, having been forced to look for a home. Thaksin still remains honorary president of the Manchester City Football Club, which he sold in August. Thaksin had considered sanctuaries such as China, the Philippines and the Bahamas. The Times reported the Thaksins were granted Bahamas honorary citizenship and the couple are building a £5.5 million home in China. The visa revocation rendered moot the UK extradition issue, but Thai prosecutors complained \"it would now be harder to keep track of him, and he could end up in a country with which Thailand does not have an extradition treaty.\" Somchai Wongsawat said: “The revoking of the visas is the decision by the Government of Great Britain. We cannot criticise.”\n\nMeanwhile, Thaksin's attorney, Udom Prongfa filed a counter-charge against Veera Somkwamkid with the Crime Suppression Division (CSD): \"Mr Veera went ahead and filed the charge even after the Royal Thai Police Office had concluded Mr Thaksin had done nothing wrong.\" Also, thousands of Thaksin supporters at the stadium gathered and claimed that only \"royal kindness or the power of the people\" could bring him home.\n\nSirisak Tiypan, director general for international affairs of the Office of the Attorney General, said: \"No matter China or the Philippines, we have an extradition treaty with both countries.\" Thaksin may appeal the guilty verdict until November 22 but prosecutors are working on extradition documents. Sirisak added \"that even if Thaksin decides to live in a country with which Thailand has no extradition treaty, authorities could ask for him to be handed over on a reciprocal basis.\" Bahamas, Bermuda and African countries without extradition treaties with Thailand have reportedly offered to take in Thaksin and his wife.\n\nThere has been a controversy on whether there is any hidden interest when Thaksin and Potjamn transferred their Shin Corp. shares to their children. Panthongtae and Pinthongtharn Shinawatra were accused of being nominees of their parents. \nPotjamn transferred her shares to Parnthongtae was said to have been a setup. For Panthongtae’s case, the shares have been sold to him at cost price. Prior the transfer, Panthongtae had written an agreement to settle a ฿4.5billion baht debt for buying 300 million shares of Thai Military Bank(TMB) to Potjaman. In which the real value of TMB share at that time was ฿1.5billion baht. This means that there has been a “fake debt” worth of ฿3billion baht.\n\nThe Assets Examination Committee (AEC) later revealed that Panthongtae’s account that receives Shin Corp. dividend has been transferring money to Potjamn’s account exceeds the debt to ฿1.1Billion baht.\n\nPintongtha was accused of being another nominee of her parents. In response to the accusation, she said that her mother gave her a certain amount of money to buy Shin Corp. shares from her brother, Panthongtae. Potjamn gave money to her daughter to buy 367 million shares of Shin Corp. which leaves Panthongtae an equal number of shares. Pintongtha's account has been receiving dividend from Shin Corp and there has not been any transaction between Pintongtha’s account and Potjamn’s account. However, the money was used to buy SC Asset shares from WinMark worth of ฿71 million baht and buy shares from another five real-estate firms from two funds in 2004 worth of ฿485 million baht.\n\nDSI, AEC, and Securities and Exchange Commission later revealed common information that WinMark and the two funds are owned by Thaksin and Potjamn Shinawatra. Potjaman responded the accusation that she did not own Winmark, neither her husband. The company is however owned by a real-estate firm from the middle east.\n\nBannapot Damapong, Potjaman Shinawatra’s brother-in law, was charged with wealth concealing of Shin Cop. Shares. Bannapot, co-founder of Shin Corp., was believed to own 1.62% of the company’s shares right from the beginning when the company turned public. Howeverm 10.75% was accused of being a nominee to Potjaman Shinawatra. The 10.75% is the separated into two sections. The first section worth of 1.62%, Bannapot used Potjaman’s money to buy the shares to increase his holdings. The 9.13% leftover was accused as being a fraud. The transaction made it look like that Bannapot was buying shares from Potjaman. But the promissory note for buying the shares was accused of being made up after the incident as the name of Potjaman was stated as “Lady Potjaman” where at the time of the transaction; her status was not yet a lady.\n\nKhunying Potjaman has received the following royal decorations in the Honours System of Thailand:\n\n\n\n", "id": "7729891", "categories": ["Spouses of Prime Ministers of Thailand", "Living people", "1956 births", "Shinawatra family"], "title": "Potjaman Na Pombejra"}

Roseland started operation in 1925 under its founder and original owner, William Muar. It continued to operate for 60 years until its closure on Labor Day September 2, 1985.\n\nRoseland originally opened up under the name \"Lakeside Park\" with little more than a dance hall and a few rides. The dance hall itself was named \"Roseland\" after the Roseland Ballroom in New York City. After three years it had become such an integral component to the park's identity, that the park itself was renamed from Lakeside to Roseland. Over the years as the park changed and grew, it saw many rides come and go. Some of the additional attractions saw things like a Ferris wheel, bumper cars, a miniature train ride, a sky ride that went out over part of Canandaigua Lake before returning to the station, and the park's Carousel, which was purchased for the park in 1941 from the defunct Long Branch amusement park. For a period of time there was even a live circus act. Additional attractions have been added and changed over the years, including the addition of the park's major wooden roller coaster, the Skyliner, which was built in 1960.\n\nThe following is a partial list of attractions Roseland had at various points throughout its history.\nOn September 16, two weeks following the park closure, an auction was held to sell off all of the park's remains. While almost nothing of the site that Roseland once occupied remains today, two of the park's most notable rides can still be found in operation. Philadelphia Toboggan Company's carousel No. 18, was purchased at the auction for $397,500 by the Pyramid Companies of Syracuse. It was refurbished and restored to its original colors, and then installed at the Carousel Center mall in Syracuse, New York on October 15, 1990. Carousel No. 18 was originally built in 1909.\n\nThe other ride still in operation is the Skyliner, a wooden roller coaster. This ride was also built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. It was built at Roseland and opened in 1960, where it operated until the park closure in 1985. It was then moved to Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pennsylvania reopening in 1987 under the same name. It was designed by John C. Allen who later went on to design the Blue Streak at Cedar Point. It is a double out and back coaster with a track length of 2400 feet, and a maximum height of 60 feet.\n\nA housing development now sits on the property where Roseland Park once was.

In the lowland Neotropical forests, \"Proechimys\" rodents are often the most abundant non-volant mammals. They are recognizable by reason of their elongated heads and long rostra, large and erect ears, narrow and long hind feet, and tails always shorter than head-and-body lengths. The dorsal pelage comprises a mixture of expanded, varyingly stiffened spines (or aristiforms) — hence the vernacular name of spiny rats — and soft hairs (or setiforms).\n\n\"Proechimys\" is the most speciose genus of the rodent family Echimyidae, with 25 species recognized, followed by \"Phyllomys\" with 13 species, and \"Trinomys\" with 11 species.\n\nThe genus \"Proechimys\" is the sister group to the genus \"Hoplomys\" (the armored rat). In turn, these two taxa share evolutionary affinities with other Myocastorini genera: \"Callistomys\" (the painted tree-rat) and \"Myocastor\" (the coypu or nutria) on the one hand, and \"Thrichomys\" on the other hand.\n\nReconstructing the systematics and phylogeny of \"Proechimys\" species have been greatly hampered by extreme levels of within- and among-population character variability. This difficulty has been emphasized by Pine \"et al.\":\nTo infer the phylogeny of \"Proechimys\" at the species level, morphological characters and mitochondrial DNA sequences have been used, and allowed to group species into major clades but whose interrelationships remain unresolved. Six species groups were identified (group \"semispinosus\", group \"longicaudatus\", group \"guyannensis\", group \"trinitatus\", group \"goeldii\", and group \"gardneri\"), and 4 species (\"Proechimys simonsi\", \"P. echinothrix\", \"P. canicollis\", and \"P. decumanus\") remained unaffiliated to any of these groups.\n<br>\nThe different groups of species can be diagnosed as follows.\n\n\"Proechimys\" species presently occur mainly in South America, in all countries except Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile.

It carries nationally syndicated programs such as \"The Mike Huckabee Show\", Geraldo Rivera, and John Bachelor. The station is home to former WAAM morning host Lucy Ann Lance. Top of the hour news updates are provided by CNN Radio. WLBY is owned by Cumulus Media.\n\n1290 on the AM dial has had quite a varied history since it first signed on in 1958 as WOIA. In 1962, WOIA jumped to the FM dial (102.9) and the AM signal was re-dubbed WOIB. (For more on the FM station, see WWWW-FM.) After several years as a MOR outlet, WOIA/WOIB began to simulcast a Top 40 format in 1967. On February 14, 1970, both stations were re-branded as \"The Winners\", with the 1290 calls changed to WNRS. Initially the \"Winners\" retained the WOIA/WOIB Top 40 format but later switched to country; WNRZ-FM also played progressive rock for a time while the AM side continued with the country format.\n\nIn 1975, WNRZ-FM brought the \"Winners\" simulcast to an end when it changed to album oriented rock as WIQB. WNRS continued on with country and later a fairly successful oldies format under the moniker \"Ann Arbor's Solid Gold.\" This continued until 1992, when the oldies format moved to new sister station WAMX-FM 107.1 as WQKL (or \"Kool 107\"). AM 1290 picked up WAMX's New Age/Adult Contemporary format and later the WAMX calls, after briefly using the call letters WIQB.\n\nIn early 1999, Tom Monaghan bought the station and changed it to an all-Catholic format and changed the calls to WDEO. Later that year, the religious programs (and the WDEO calls) were shifted to the former WWCM at 990 AM, and 1290 changed formats again. Now, under new owners Cumulus, it was \"WYBN, Your Business News\".\n\nIn May 2000, Clear Channel Communications acquired Cumulus' Ann Arbor stations, including WYBN. The following year, Clear Channel switched it to WCAS, with an adult standards format dubbed \"American Music Classics.\" In July 2002, 1290 saw the revival of \"Honey Radio\", an all-oldies format that was popular on the former WHND (now WRDT) in the 1980s and 90s; now the calls were WHNE (also the calls of WHND's old FM outlet in the 1970s, now WCSX). \"Honey Radio\" took the \"Real Oldies\" approach that Clear Channel tried at WSAI Cincinnati, WRLL Chicago and several other AM stations, playing mostly 1950s and 1960s hits with very limited post-1970 material. The format was AM 1290's most successful in some time, but lasted only about two years, until August 2004, when WHNE became WLBY — the tenth callsign the station has used, and the longest-lived (13 years as of 2017).\n\nIn December 2006, Cumulus reacquired Clear Channel's Ann Arbor stations, including WLBY, as part of a multi-station swap. Cumulus' future plans for WLBY remain unknown, although Cumulus has said it does not plan to change the formats of any of its Ann Arbor stations.\n\nOn March 16, 2009, WLBY switched to a business talk radio format, abandoning the progressive talk format that included the bankrupt Air America Radio network.\n\nIn the following two years, WLBY added new programs to feature more of a news-talk format, and not just business talk. Weekday programs and hosts include \"The Steve Gruber Show\" featuring Steve Gruber, \"The Lucy Ann Lance Show\", Mike Huckabee, Geraldo,\" The HUGE Show\", and John Batchelor. Weekends consist primarily of the Bloomberg Radio feed, but also include \"The Financial Fitness Show\", \"USA Financial Headquarters\", and \"The Michigan Business Show\".\n\n", "id": "7730030", "categories": ["Radio stations established in 1958", "Radio stations in Michigan"], "title": "WLBY"}

Pitseolak was Baffin Island's first indigenous photographer.\n\nPitseolak was born September 2 1902 on Nottingham Island, Northwest Territories. He lived most of his life in traditional Inuit camps near Cape Dorset, on the southwest coast of Baffin Island, now in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. IN the face of rapid technological change in the Inuit community, Pitseolak dedicated himself to preserving knowledge of the traditional ways of living, by writing, sketching, and especially photography. He documented customs, hunting techniques, stories and myths. His brother was Pootoogoo, a chief.\n\nIn 1912 Pitseolak met photographer Robert J. Flaherty. Flaherty, best known today for his documentary movie \"Nanook of the North\" (1922), inspired Pitseolak's interest in photography. It was not until the 1930s, however, that Pitseolak took his first recorded photograph. This was for a white visitor who was afraid to approach a polar bear for a shot. Pitseolak took the photo for him, using the visitor's camera.\n\nIn 1923 Pitseolak was married to Annie from Kimmirut. Seven children resulted from their marriage; only Udluriak and Kooyoo, two daughters, survived. Annie was sticken with tuberculosis in 1939 and died.\n\nIn the 1940s Pitseolak was living in Cape Dorset working for fur-traders when he acquired his first camera, from a Catholic missionary. With the help of his second wife Aggeok (1906-1977), he developed his first photographs in a hunting igloo. Many difficulties had to be overcome, including extreme climate changes, high light levels from the reflective snowscape, and the difficulty of obtaining film and developer. Peter and Aggeok experimented. They used a battery-powered flashlight covered with red cloth as a safelight, and a lens filter made from old sunglasses.\n\nHe was also a painter, executing a series of watercolors in 1939 for John Buchan, later 2nd Baron Tweedsmuir, son of Governor General John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir. \n\nPitseolak wrote various diaries, notes and manuscripts, all in Inuktitut syllabics. Along with Dorothy Harley Eber, he published \"People From Our Side\" (1975), the story of his early life, and \"Peter Pitseolak's Escape From Death\" (1977), an account of a near disaster among the ice floes.\n\nHe photographed himself, his family, and community members in candid shots. He also posed them with traditional clothing and implements. Over twenty years, Pitseolak made more than 2,000 photographs of the disappearing traditional way of life. In 1961, at the age of 59, he left his camp at Keatuk and returned to settlement life at Cape Dorset. After his death in 1973, more than 1,500 negatives and photographs were purchased from his widow for the National museums of Canada (now part of Canadian Museum of History).\n\nThe famed sculptor Okpik Pitseolak (b. 1946) married Peter's son Mark Pitseolak. According to Terry Ryan, former manager of the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative, Peter Pitseolak's nephew, Kananginak Pootoogook, greatly admired and was influenced by his uncle and also became an artist.\n\nHe died September 30, 1973 in Cape Dorset, Northwest Territories.\n\n\n", "id": "7730032", "categories": ["1973 deaths", "People from Qikiqtaaluk Region", "Writers from Nunavut", "Canadian diarists", "Inuit writers", "Canadian photographers", "Inuit photographers", "1902 births", "Inuit from the Northwest Territories", "Artists from Nunavut"], "title": "Peter Pitseolak"}

() was a Chinese professional football club based in Chengdu, China who last played in the 26,000 seater Shuangliu Sports Centre in the China League One division. The club was founded on 26 February 1996 and was formerly known as Chengdu Wuniu (Five Bulls) named after their first sponsor, the Wuniu (Five Bulls) Cigarette Company. However, the club was officially dissolved on 4 January 2015 and was subsequently de-registered by the Chinese Football Association on 31 January 2015 due to unpaid salaries to players and staff.\n\nThe team was named after English professional football club Sheffield United. On 11 December 2005, Sheffield United took over the organization and changed the club's badge as well as the team's home kit to represent this. The club went on to achieve promotion and their highest ever league position of seventh in the top tier of Chinese football until they were embroiled in a match-fixing scandal in 2009. Punished with relegation the owners eventually sold their majority on 9 December 2010 to Hung Fu Enterprise Co., Ltd and Scarborough Development (China) Co., Ltd. On 23 May 2013 the Tiancheng Investment Group announced the acquisition of the club.\n\nThe club was formed on 26 February 1996 under the name Chengdu Wuniu and entered into China's Yi League with Wang Fengzhu as their first manager. In their inaugural year the team topped both their second round group as well as their final round group and progressed to the semi-finals before losing to Shenzhen Jinpeng 2–1 on aggregate. Their second season in 1997 season saw them rise into China's Jia B League, this time coming second in the 2nd round group but again topping the final round group. They went on to win both their legs of the quarter finals 1–0 against Beijing Kuanli and after brushing aside Shaanxi Guoli 2–0 they progressed through to the final but lost 1–0 however they were still promoted along with the winners Jiangsu Jiajia as well as both semi-final losers.\n\nAfter gaining promotion to the second tier Chengdu Wuniu started the 1998 campaign well losing only two of their first nine matches in the higher division however in round 10 they were well beaten 8–0 away to Liaoning Tianlun. Their best win came in their penultimate match of the season when they beat Jiangsu Jiajia 4–1 and the team ended the season mid-table in eighth out of 12. Chengdu's second year in Jia B once again started well with the team losing just 1 of their first 13th games before succumbing to Beijing Kuanli away 4–0. At the end of the season after 22 matches Chengdu Wuniu finished 6th with 9 wins and 8 draws. The start of the millennium season saw a name change for the team to Chengdu Wuniu Guoteng and proceeded with a poorer start than in previous years including defeat away to Guangzhou Apollo 5–0 however the team did manage to finish in 8th place.\n\nThe team started well for the 2001 season going unbeaten in their first eight games and went on to finish in third position however the season was tarnished when match fixing allegations came to light involving Chengdu Wuniu Guoteng and four other teams. The team's record win over Sichuan Mianyang Taiji 11–2 and their 4–2 away victory against Jiangsu Shuntian were put under the spotlight and as a consequence all coaches and players involved in both matches (along with another game featuring the other two teams) were banned for one year, and all five teams had three months to reform and re-apply for playing in the next season's CFA competitions. The only points were deducted from Sichuan Mianyang Taiji but they were relegated as punishment. To make the season even more disappointing Chengdu Wuniu Guoteng fell at the first round of the Mexin Doors FA Cup losing 2–1 away to Jia A League side Tianjin Teda CEC.\n\nIn 2002 Chengdu Wuniu Guoteng were reformed as a result of the previous season's match fixing and were renamed Chengdu Taihe. Early in the season the team final progressed passed the first round of the Fuji Films FA Cup beating Shenyang Ginde 3–2 in nearby Deyang with a last minute goal however they were soon on their way home again after losing 3–1 to Qingdao Yizhong Hainiu once again in Deyang. The league competition followed in much the same vein with the team finishing in 9th of 12 however a mid-season venue change to City Stadium in Luzhou can't have helped however Santos did manage to achieve joint top divisional scorer with 10 goals for the club.\n\nThe team crashed out yet again in the earliest stage of the Landi FA Cup in 2003 losing 2 of their 3 group matches. The team started using City Stadium in Deyang as its home ground this season and its name reverted to the name Chengdu Wuniu in round 6 of the league in July. They finished the year in a respectable 6th place out of 14 after the division had been enlarged and beat 4th placed Jiangsu Shuntian 5–1 in October.\n\nChengdu Wuniu's poor cup performance continued in 2004 losing 5–3 on penalties after extra time to Qingdao Beilaite in the first round of the Landi FA Cup. The poor performance also contributed to their final position of 13th out of 17 that year after another enlargement. This season was also played at two differing home venues, the Provincial Sports Centre in Chengdu as well as City Stadium in Deyang.\n\nThe 2005 season was finally played back at one home venue in Chengdu, the Chengdu Sports Centre. They again crashed out of the CFA Cup in the first round, this time to Chinese Super League side Shanghai International. Their poor performance in the league also continued, finishing 11th of 14 in the league.\n\nChengdu Wuniu underwent another name change in January 2006 when they were bought out by the then Chairman of English football team Sheffield United's Kevin McCabe who renamed the club Chengdu Blades to reflect the new owner's nickname The Blades as well as changing the kits and badge while the reserve team were sent to Hong Kong and named \"Sheffield United (Hong Kong)\" to advertise its association with the owning company. Sheffield United’s unique international football model would continue with the purchase of Hungarian club Ferencvárosi TC and significant stakes with Australian team Central Coast Mariners FC, which were overseen by Group Executive Director, Michael Farnan who was responsible for the commercial development of the Sheffield United International Group. While this was going on the team's performance improved and by the end of the year they had climbed to 4th position in the table, their 2nd best ever finish at that time.\n\nAt the start of the 2007 Chinese league campaign Chengdu's opening game of the season against Harbin Yiteng finished in a 6–0 victory in front of a home crowd of 4000 spectators, which resulted in the opposing Head Coach, Wang Hongli creating a Chinese League record for the fastest resignation after just one game. The club's strong start to the season continued and they wouldn't even concede their first goal until 26 May 2007 in their Round 9 league game against Tibet Huitong, which they still went on to win 2–1. Even during the league break Chengdu went on to face Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua in a friendly that Chengdu came back to win 2–1. Round 14 commenced with a 3–1 win against Harbin Yiteng and the Blades moved onto the top spot. However, following consecutive 1–1 draws with Nanchang Bayi and Chongqing Lifan, the Blades fell back into 2nd position. This was cemented by their first defeat of the season, losing 2–1 against leaders Guangzhou Guangyao.\n\nThe Blades returned to winning ways with 4 straight wins against Beijing Hongdeng (2–0), Nanjing Yoyo (6–1), Qingdao Hailifeng (2–0) and Tibet Huitong (3–0) and after 20 games the Blades were still in the second automatic promotion place with just another 4 matches to play, 5 points behind Guangzhou Pharmaceutical.\n\nThe Blades snatched victory 2–1 in the last minute against Yanbian in their next away game to put themselves within touching distance of promotion requiring just one more win which followed a week later in round 23 with Chengdu securing their place in next season's beating Shanghai Stars 4–2 in front of their home crowd.\n\nChengdu drew their penultimate game of the season 1–1 against BIT Beijing and faced former promotion rivals, 3rd placed Jiangsu Shuntian in the final fixture of the China League at home on 27 October which finished 0–0 to ensure a promotion party just two seasons after the buyout by Sheffield United.\n\nChengdu had the privilege of staging the opening ceremony of the 2008 season of the Chinese Super League before their first match at home to Liaoning F.C. which was broadcast live on Chinese TV. The newcomers fell behind after an hours play but managed to earn a point just a few minutes later after Liu Cheng equalised. After an away defeat to 2007 champions Changchun Yatai on 5 April, the Blades had two successive victories against Zhejiang Lücheng and Dalian Shide to move into 3rd place. And on 27 April 2008, Chengdu Blades beat Shanghai Shenhua with a score 2–1 and moved into the second place. This was followed by a 3–1 away loss to Tianjin Teda and then a 1–1 draws against Qingdao Jonoon.\n\nOn 12 May Chengdu was rocked by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, none of the Chengdu Blades personnel were injured and in the following days both staff and players donated blood for the cause. The players also visited schools affected by the earthquake and the club donated more than £11,000 along with tents, umbrellas, water, food and clothes including more than 5000 football shirts to people affected in the region. At the following game against Changsha Ginde on 17 May China League's first ever minute's silence was held before the match, which ended in a 1–1 draw, all gate money from this rounds games around China would also be given to the disaster zones.\n\nIn the remaining rounds Chengdu only won one more game beating Shenzhen 3–0 at home, drew another 9 matches (4 of which were 0–0 draws) and lost the other 10 games. This was enough to finish 13th in table and avoid relegation.\n\nOn 23 February 2010, Chengdu was relegated to China League One in the fallout of a match fixing scandal despite having achieved a 7th-place finish in the Chinese Super League the previous season. It was discovered by the Chinese police that on 22 September 2007 during the team's promotion campaign that the club's President Xu Hongtao and his deputy You Kewei paid Qingdao Hailifeng F.C. up to 500,000 RMB to lose a league game 2–0. Despite this setback under Wang Baoshan as manager, Chengdu Blades won immediate promotion back to the Chinese Super League after finishing second in league one, one point behind winners Guangzhou. With the club's owners Sheffield United struggling within their own league funding for Chengdu Blades was cut and they experienced financial problems during the season, which resulted in the club finishing 15th and in the relegation zone at the end of the season.\n\n18 – Yao Xia, striker (2005–10).

By AFSPC order the unit inactivated 24 May 2007. Its mission and members moved to the Combat Operations Division of the 614th Air and Space Operations Center (614 AOC). The inactivation was part of the larger USAF plan to implement the Numbered Air Force-Component structure. The unit's members became the plankholders of the 614th Air and Space Operations Center and the Joint Space Operations Center.\n\nThe 614th Space Operations Squadron mission was to provide Air Force Space Command's Fourteenth Air Force Commander (14 AF/CC (AFSTRAT-SP)) and US Strategic Command’s Commander, Joint Functional Component Command for Space (CDR JFCC SPACE) with the space operations expertise to command and control space forces in continuous support of global and theater operations.\n\nRepresenting the 14 AF/CC (AFSTRAT-SP) and CDR JFCC SPACE, the 614 SOPS delivered Air Force space force capabilities to users around the globe, 24-hours a day.\n\nThe 614 SOPS was first constituted as the 614th Space Operations Flight (SOPF) in April 1996 with thirty-seven assigned members. Initially housed in two temporary facilities, the 614 SOPF christened a new Space Operations Center (SOC) in November 1997. The SOC was redesignated the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) in July 1999 under the command of Major General Robert Hinson (USAF official biography). With the support Headquarters Air Force Space Command, the JSpOC manpower grew to over 100 positions. With the May 2005 ribbon-cutting of the new JSpOC, along with the stand up of the 614th Space Intelligence Squadron and 614th Space Communications Squadron, as well as the alignment of the 1st Space Control Squadron under the 614th Space Operations Group, and augmentation of the 9th Space Operations Squadron (Air Force Reserve) in every joint mission area, the 614 SOPS transitioned from the sole force provider to one of several force providers to the JSpOC.\n\nWith the January 2005 stand-up of the 614th Space Communications Squadron, the four Satellite Communication (SATCOM) Support Centers located at Peterson AFB, Colorado; MacDill AFB, Florida; Stuttgart, Germany; and Wahiawa, Hawaii transferred from 614 SOPS administrative control. These operating locations and their twenty-five communications NCOs had been under 614 SOPS control since October 1999.\n\nA combination of the realignment of the Numbered Air Force components with the implementation of Program Action Directive 06-09 (Nov 2006), the redesignation of the 614th Space Operations Group to the 614th Air and Space Operations Center, and the signature of an AFSPC special order, the squadron of inactivated on 24 May 2007. A ceremony celebrating their past and look toward the future was conducted by Maj Gen William L. Shelton on 18 Jun 2007 in front of the HQ 14 AF.\n\nMembers assigned to the 614 SOPS have a distinguished history earning many awards, including the Air Force Organizational Excellence Award in 1998; Air Force Outstanding Unit for 2005, 2006 and 2007; and Air Force Association Citation of Honor for 2006. As a force provider to the Joint Space Operations Center, the squadron also shared in the honors as the 2005 and 2007 winner of USSTRATCOM's Omaha Trophy for the Best Space and Information Operations Unit.\n\nAir Force Outstanding Unit Award \nAir Force Organizational Excellence Award \n\nThe 614 SOPS patch primary colors were black and gold. Black signifies dignity and determination and gold represents excellence, honor, and high values: the qualities and spirit of the 614 SOPS. The tiger eyes represent the mission for assessing the status of the 14 Air Force space forces. The globe, with the overseas landmasses, symbolizes the squadron’s worldwide mission. Additionally, the Air Force star shows our tie to the original Army Air Corps. The parabolic arch encircling the globe denotes command and control of space forces operating weapons systems traversing through space.\n\nThe 614 Air and Space Operations Center/Combat Operations Division (614 AOC/COD) patch, shown above, is a morale patch and not approved by Air Force Heraldry. With exception of the top and bottom rockers, the patch is exactly the same as the 614 SOPS patch.

The DCCC also sent her a late contribution of $75,000.00.\n\nUltimately, Feder lost to Wolf, 57.25%-40.89%, but gave him the closest challenge he had faced in 24 years (with the obvious exceptions of the 1982 and 1986 campaigns). The 10th district is notorious as a difficult district for challengers due to its reliance upon the expensive Washington, D.C. media market. This is evidenced by the fact that Wolf required multiple campaigns to win the seat.\n\nIn February 2008, \"CQ Politics\" rated Feder ninth nationally in terms of \"U.S. House Candidates challenging incumbents of the opposite party who had the most cash-on-hand as of Dec. 31.\" She won the June 10 Democratic primary and faced Republican incumbent Frank Wolf in the November 4 general election.\n\nJudy Feder lost the bid for election to Frank Wolf during the November 4 general elections 36% to 60%. With 190 of 194 precincts reporting she had 123,627 votes to Frank Wolf's 198,286 votes and Neraj Nigam's 7,353 votes. In a year when Democrats won the Presidential vote and the open Virginia Senate race, Judy Feder actually received a lower percentage of the vote than she had received in 2006.\n\n", "id": "7730053", "categories": ["Brandeis University alumni", "Women in Virginia politics", "Center for American Progress people", "Northern Virginia politicians", "Year of birth missing (living people)", "Candidates in the 2006 United States elections", "Georgetown University faculty", "Living people", "Virginia Democrats", "Harvard University alumni"], "title": "Judy Feder"}

The case stood for the proposition that a representation made by one party cannot become a term of a contract if made after the agreement was made. The representation can only be binding where it was made at the time the contract was formed.\n\nMrs Olley was a long staying resident of the Marlborough Court Hotel, Lancaster Gate, London. As usual she left her room key on a rack behind the reception one day, but when she came back it was gone. Inside her room, her fur coat had been stolen. (A witness called Colonel Crerer, who was sitting in the lounge, saw a person go in and come out again with a parcel fifteen minutes later.) The porter had apparently been cleaning a bust of the Duke of Marlborough and failed to notice. Mrs Olley asked to be repaid for the cost of the coat. The Hotel pointed to an exclusion clause on a notice behind a door in the bedroom leading to a washbasin, which said,\n\"The proprietors will not hold themselves responsible for articles lost or stolen, unless handed to the manageress for safe custody.\"\nMrs Olley argued that the clause was not incorporated into the contract.\n\nDenning LJ, Singleton LJ and Bucknill LJ found, firstly, that the Hotel had failed to take reasonable care as they were required to do contractually and under Innkeepers' Liability Act 1863 s 1.\nSecondly, the disclaimer was not part of the contract and the hotel could not rely upon it. The contract for the storage of the coat was formed at the reception desk. There was no way that Mrs Olley could have been aware of the disclaimer at that point and so it could not be part of the contract.\n\n", "id": "7730116", "categories": ["Court of Appeal of England and Wales cases", "1949 in British law", "Lord Denning cases", "English contract case law", "English incorporation case law"], "title": "Olley v Marlborough Court Ltd"}

In 2008, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. It also received a Best Song nomination in the 1968 Academy Awards.\n\nThe music was written by Burt Bacharach, and was originally intended to be an instrumental. But later Hal David added the lyrics, and the song was published in 1967. According to Bacharach, the melody was inspired by watching Ursula Andress in an early cut of the film.\n\nThe first recording is by Stan Getz as an instrumental in December 1966. The song with lyrics was originally recorded by Dusty Springfield for the \"Casino Royale\" soundtrack, receiving an Oscar nomination and reaching the US Top 40. Phil Ramone, the soundtrack's engineer, recorded the song separately from the rest of the film tracks. Springfield re-recorded the song the same year in London, featuring a throaty saxophone solo, and released it as the B-side of \"Give Me Time\". Claudine Longet recorded the song on her 1967 album of the same title. Lainie Kazan also recorded \"The Look of Love\" (arranged by Pat Williams) on her 1967 album \"Love is Lainie\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7730205", "text": "Aenesidemus (book)\n\nAenesidemus is a German book published anonymously by Professor Gottlob Ernst Schulze of Helmstedt in 1792. Schulze attempted to refute the principles that Karl Leonhard Reinhold established in support of Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781). The title is a reference to Aenesidemus, an ancient Greek skeptical philosopher. Its complete title, in English translation, was \"Aenesidemus or Concerning the Foundations of the Philosophy of the Elements Issued by Professor Reinhold in Jena Together with a Defense of Skepticism against the Pretensions of the Critique of Reason\" (). \n\nThe book was supposed to be a written correspondence between Hermias (Greek: \"a follower of Hermes\"), who believes in the Kantian critical philosophy, and Aenesidemus (Greek: \"he who praises the people\"), who is skeptical about that philosophy. The skepticism of David Hume's skepticism about induction, according to this book, was not disproved by Kant. As Hume had asserted, the existence of causality, the soul, or the thing-in-itself cannot be proved.\n\nPhilosophy cannot establish the existence or non-existence of the thing-in-itself. By establishing general principles, we can't know the limits of our ability to know. Progressive development, however, can approach complete knowledge.\n\nNo skeptic can doubt the reality and certainty of mental representations and mental events that are immediately given through consciousness.\n\nSkepticism does not claim that metaphysical questions cannot be answered.\n\nSkepticism doubts the possibility of knowledge about the existence or non-existence of the thing-in-itself. Kant, however, was guilty of begging the question in that he presupposed that the thing-in-itself exists and causally interacts with observing subjects.\n\nKant and Reinhold claimed that the reality of objects can be known from the representations in the mind of the observing subject. This is inferring objective reality from subjective thought. Such an inference is the fallacy of drawing existential conclusions from logical premises.\n\nKant's critical philosophy is self-contradictory. He said that things-in-themselves cause sensations in an observer's mind. Kant applied causality to noumena. But, in his critique, he had claimed that causality is a category of the understanding that can only be applied to phenomena.\n\nKant posited real existence to the postulates of God, Free Will, and Immortal Souls. But this is more than is necessary for moral theology, which only requires belief in them as Ideas of Reason.\n\nThe science of psychology does not require that the soul have faculties. Rather, psychology is a detailed description and systematic classification of actual mental events.\n\nIf we were to take critical philosophy seriously, we would commit ourselves to resolving experiences into two parts — a system of universal subjective forms on one side, and a mass of amorphous, meaningless objective matter on the other.\n\nHow can we be sure that Kant's obligation to be moral is the result of freedom? It might be the result of some irrational natural force.\n\nKant's response was indicated in his letter to Jakob Sigismund Beck, December 4, 1792: \n\nReinhold wrote that true skepticism rested on the fact that only the observing subject felt what was in its consciousness. The only truth is the subject's notion that there is an object that agrees with its internal mental representation. \n\nJohann Fichte agreed with Reinhold's subjectivity. He based his own idealism on the observing subject's internal forms of knowledge. Arthur Schopenhauer agreed with Schulze: [\"Therefore the world as [REPRESENTATION], in which aspect alone we are here considering it, has two essential, necessary, and inseparable halves. The one half is the object, whose forms are space and time, and through these plurality. But the other half, the subject, does not lie in space and time, for it is whole and undivided in every representing being. Hence a single one of these beings with the object completes the world as representation just as fully as do the millions that exist. And if that single one were to disappear, then the world as representation would no longer exist. Therefore these halves are inseparable even in thought, for each of the two has meaning and existence only through and for the other; each exists with the other and vanishes with it.\"].\n\n", "id": "7730205", "categories": ["1792 books", "Skepticism", "Immanuel Kant"], "title": "Aenesidemus (book)"}

The English equivalent for \"ébéniste\", \"ebonist\", is not commonly used. Originally, an \"ébéniste\" was one who worked with ebony, a favoured luxury wood for mid-seventeenth century Parisian cabinets, originating in imitation of elite furniture being made in Antwerp. The word is 17th century in origin. Early Parisian ébénistes often came from the Low Countries themselves: an outstanding example is Pierre Golle, who worked at the \"Gobelins manufactory\" making cabinets and table tops veneered with marquetry, the traditional enrichment of \"ébénisterie\", or \"cabinet-work\".\n\nÉbénistes make case furniture, which may be veneered or painted. Under Parisian guild regulations, the application of painted varnishes, generically called \"vernis Martin\", was carried out in separate workshops, sawdust being an enemy to freshly varnished surfaces. At the outset of the French Revolution the guilds in Paris and elsewhere were abolished, and with them went all their regulations. One result of this is that Paris chairmakers were now able to produce veneered chairs, as London furniture-makers, less stringently ruled, had been able to make since the first chairs with splats had been produced shortly before 1720, in imitation of Chinese chairs.\n\nBecause of this amalgamation, chairs and other seat furniture began to use veneering techniques which were formerly the guarded privilege of ébénistes. This privilege became less distinct after the relaxation of guild rules of the Ancien Régime, and after the French Revolution's abolition of guilds in 1791. Seat furniture in the Empire style was often veneered with mahogany, and later in pale woods also.\n\nFrom the mid-nineteenth century onward, the two French trades, \"ébéniste\" and \"menuisier,\" were often assembled under the single roof of a \"furnisher\", and the craft began to make way for the industry. \n\nFrom the mid-17th century through the 18th, a notable number of ébénistes of German and Low Countries extraction were pre-eminent among Parisian furniture-makers, as the abbreviated list below suggests.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7730229", "categories": ["Furniture-making", "Furniture makers", "Crafts"], "title": "Ébéniste"}

The village is inhabited by Muslim Albanians who speak the Lab dialect of Albanian.\n\nBorsh borders with Fterra, Qeparo, Piqeras and has a population of 2500 inhabitants.\n\nThe region which Borshi is located was part of the Chaonia of the ancient region of Epirus. The castle remained in use in Roman times and was refortified by the Emperor Justinian in the sixth century. Nothing is known of the settlement in the Byzantine era, until it is mentioned as Sopotos in 1258 when it was part of the Despotate of Epirus tha grew out of the failing Byzantine empire. Borsh then went through a period of considerable turmoil, changing hands several times between the Despotate of Epirus and Norman crusades invaders before being taken by the Turks in 1431.\n\nFifty years later it was captured by Albanians led by Skenderbeg, but was retaken by the Turks only eleven years later and heavily refortified. On June 10, 1570 the castle of Sopot was taken by James Celsi, Proveditor of the Venetian navy, who left after leaving in charge the Greek commander of Nauplion, Emmanuel Mormoris. This also triggered part of the nearby Himariotes to submit to Venetian rule. The next year the Ottoman army recaptured it and took Mormori as a prisoner.\n\nThe 18th century was a turbulent economic time and due to Orthodox revolts and conflicts with Orthodox powers such as the Russian Empire, Ottoman governors at times applied pressures including drastic tax raises on the local Christian population as well as other pressures caused towns to convert. Borsh converted in 1744 and followed it up by raiding nearby Piqeras, which remained Christian.\nThe fortress was renovated again by Ali Pasha Tepelena, and it is these fortifications that visitors can view by taking the half-hour walk up to the ‘castle rock’ the limestone mount clearly visible above the old village. During Ali pasha’s reign there were 700 houses at Borsh, and below the castle mount you can see a ruined mosque of Hajji Bendo and madrese (a Muslim theological school), both of which were damaged in Ali Pasha’s wars but survived, only to be destroyed by fighting after 1912 when the Turks left the region.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1914 serious inter-ethnic conflict took place between Greeks and Albanians, and significant portion of the old village was destroyed, however some fine buildings remain. Modern Borsh was built after that, but became seriously depopulated, first due to malaria, and following severe reprisal killings by Germans in WW2 however, depopulation was balanced by an influx of refugees from Vlora, fleeing into partisan territory from the city which was heavily contested until late in the war.\n\nThe village is very stable and growing in prosperity thanks to tourism and olive oil production. The thing that makes Borsh very popular is its beach, which is the largest beach in Ionian sea (7 km).\n\nThe tourism has begun to develop a lot thanks to village's beauty and thanks to its friendly people. Continuing in this way Borsh will become soon the best destination for tourists in the South of Albania.\n\nThe Lab dialect spoken in Borsh was reported by Albanian linguist M Totoni to possess nasal vowels, a characteristic that was previously thought to have been the diagnostic difference between the major Tosk and Gheg divisions, whereby Tosk dialects such as Borsh's lab dialect were previously thought to have all lost nasal vowels when they split from Gheg dialects, which retained the nasality feature.\n\n", "id": "7730242", "categories": ["Beaches of Albania", "Archaeological sites in Albania", "Populated places in Himara"], "title": "Borsh"}

It stands not far from the manor house, Cotheridge Court. The church boasts an ancient, wooden tower. The main part of the church, the nave, has a plastered ceiling with its beams remaining hidden though some ceiling beams in the chancel are visible. The chancel floor is partially tiled. \n\nThe church belongs to the Diocese of Worcester with its denomination being Church of England, and small services are still held. It lies upon the pilgrimage route to Wales from Worcester, and is today a visitors centre.\n\nThe oldest parts of the church are the chancel and the nave which contains a carved, stone Norman Arch dividing them. These date to the early part of the 12th century during the reign of Henry I. The walls of the chancel and the nave are probably sandstone, but they are plastered on both sides. The windows in the nave are also 12th century. The ceiling of the nave is plastered, and is curved with no beams showing.\n\nDuring the 15th century the wooden, bell tower was added. It is square, ascends in four stages and is built of chestnut and oak. The studded, oak doorway to the tower also provides access to the church.\n\nDating from the 17th century it is oak-panelled and is hexagonal in shape.\n\nIn the chancel the floor is made of reddish tiles. Four of them bear the arms of Gloucester Abbey, three of them with the Elephant Head of Throckmorton, two carry the Berkeley arms, and one a Passion Shield inscribed in Latin.\n\nSince 1570 the ownership has followed the descent of the manor house, Cotheridge Court, and in 1623 John Acton sold the church to William Berkeley, who had previously purchased the manor from Acton in 1615.\n\nIn 1684 it received restoration from Rowland Berkeley and between 1615 and 1939 it has been cared for by the Berkeley family. It is now a part of the Diocese of Worcester.\n\nIn November, 1947 the nave roof collapsed. Though there were only about 200 people in the parish they decided to save their church. After 13 years the restoration work was completed but it was considered unsafe to leave the four bells in the bell tower, and to this day only one remains.\n\nOnce again, in April 1979 the nave roof was considered unsafe with the possibility of collapsing. The people of Cotheridge and their neighbouring parishes raised money for the restoration. With additional help from the Worcester Diocese, English Heritage and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust the work was completed in 1987.\n\nThe churchyard contains two war graves of Royal Artillery soldiers of World War II.\n", "id": "7730251", "categories": ["Church of England church buildings in Worcestershire"], "title": "St Leonard's Church, Cotheridge"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7730261", "text": "Passing (novel)\n\nPassing is a novel by American author Nella Larsen, first published in 1929. Set primarily in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City in the 1920s, the story centers on the reunion of two childhood friends—Clare Kendry and Irene Redfield—and their increasing fascination with each other's lives. The title refers to the practice of \"racial passing\", and is a key element of the novel; Clare Kendry's attempt to pass as white for her husband, John (Jack) Bellew, is its most significant depiction in the novel, and a catalyst for the tragic events.\n\nLarsen's exploration of race was informed by her own mixed racial heritage and the increasingly common practice of racial passing in the 1920s. Praised upon publication, the novel has since been celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction of race, gender and sexuality, and is the subject of considerable scholarly criticism. As one of only two novels that Larsen wrote, \"Passing\" has been significant in placing its author at the forefront of several literary canons.\n\nAs early as 1925, Nella Larsen had decided that she wanted to be among the \"New Negro\" writers receiving considerable attention at the time. Initially writing short stories that were sold early in 1926 to a ladies magazine, she was rumored that year to be writing a novel. In a letter to her friend, Carl Van Vechten, she acknowledges, \"it is the awful Truth. But, who knows if I'll get through with the damned thing. Certainly not I.\" In April 1927, Larsen and her husband, Elmer Imes, moved from Jersey City, New Jersey to Harlem to be closer to the cultural phenomenon. The following year, Larsen published her first novel \"Quicksand\" with New York-based publisher Knopf, and its favorable critical reception encouraged her ambitions to become known as a novelist.\n\nThe 1920s in the United States was a period marked by considerable anxiety and discussion over the crossing of racial boundaries, the so-called \"color line\" between blacks and whites. This anxiety was exacerbated by the Great Migration, in which hundreds of thousands of blacks left the rural south for northern and midwestern cities, where, together with new waves of immigrants, they changed the social makeup. The practice of persons \"crossing the color line\"—attempting to claim recognition in another racial group than the one they were believed to belong to—was known as \"passing\". As many African Americans had European ancestry in varying proportions, some appeared visibly European.) The legacy of slavery, with its creation of a racial caste, and the imposition in the early 20th century of the so-called one-drop rule (by which someone with even one ancestor of sub-Saharan-African origin was considered black) led to a hardening of racial lines that had historically been more fluid; at any time, the concept of race was \"historically contingent.\" Although the exact numbers of people who passed is, for obvious reasons, not known, many estimates were made at the time. The sociologist Charles S. Johnson (1893–1956) calculated that 355,000 blacks had passed between 1900 and 1920.\n\nA significant precedent for Larsen's depiction of Clare and Jack's relationship was the 1925 legal trial known as the \"Rhinelander Case\" (or \"Rhinelander v. Rhinelander\"). On the urging of his family, Leonard Kip Rhinelander, a wealthy white man, sued his wife, Alice Beatrice Jones, for annulment and fraud; he alleged that she had failed to inform him of her \"colored\" blood. The case concerned not only race but also status and class, as he had met her when she was working as a domestic. Although the jury eventually returned a verdict for Alice (she contended that her mixed race was obvious, and she had never denied it), it came at a devastating social cost for both parties; intimate exchanges between the couple were read out in court, and Alice was forced to partially disrobe in front of the jury in the judge's chambers in order for them to assess the darkness of her skin. \nLarsen refers to the case near the end of the novel, when Irene wonders about the consequences of Jack discovering Clare's racial status: \"What if Bellew should divorce Clare? Could he? There was the \"Rhinelander\" case.\" The case received substantial coverage in the press of the time, and Larsen could assume that it was common knowledge to her readers.\n\nThe story is written as a third person narrative from the perspective of Irene Redfield, a mixed-race woman who lives in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City.\n\nPart One of the book, titled \"Encounter,\" opens with Irene receiving a letter from Clare Kendry, causing her to recall a chance encounter she had had with her, at the roof restaurant of the Drayton Hotel in Chicago, during a brief stay in the city. Irene does not answer Clare's attempts to reconnect written in the letters.The women grew up together but lost touch when Clare's white father died and she was taken to live with her two paternal white aunts. Irene learns that Clare \"passes\" for white, living primarily in Europe with her unsuspecting, rich, white husband and their daughter. Although Irene tries to avoid further engagement with Clare, she never is able to fully exclude her from her life as she later visits Clare for tea along with another childhood friend, Gertrude Martin. Toward the end of the visit, Clare's white husband John (Jack) Bellew arrives. Unaware that all three women are black, Jack expresses some very racist views and makes the women uneasy. However, the women play along in an effort to maintain Clare's secret identity. Afterward, Irene and Gertrude decide that Clare's situation is too dangerous for them to continue associating with her and are uncomfortable around Clare and her husband. Irene receives a letter of apology from Clare but destroys it in her quest to try and forget about Clare and get her out of her life. Instead Irene wants to focus on her life with her husband, Brian, and her two sons, Theodore and Brian Jr.\n\nPart Two of the book, \"Re-encounter,\" returns to the present, with Irene having received the new letter from Clare. After Irene ignores Clare's letter, Clare visits in person so Irene reluctantly agrees to see her. When it is brought up that Irene serves on the committee for the \"Negro Welfare League\" (NWL) Clare invites herself to their upcoming dance despite Irene's advice against it for fear that Jack will find out. Clare attends the dance and enjoys herself without her husband finding out, which encourages her to continue spending time in Harlem. Irene and Clare resume their childhood companionship, and Clare frequently visits Irene's home.\n\nThe third and final part of the novel begins before Christmas, as Irene's relationship with her husband has become increasingly fraught. Aware of her friend's appeal, Irene becomes convinced that her husband is having an affair with Clare. During a shopping trip with her visibly black friend Felise Freeland, Irene encounters Jack, who becomes aware of her and, by extension, Clare's, racial status. Irene considers warning Clare about Jack's new-found knowledge but decides against it, worried that the pair's divorce might encourage her husband to leave her for Clare. Later, Clare accompanies Irene and Brian to a party hosted by Felise. The gathering is interrupted by Jack, who accuses Clare of being a \"damned dirty nigger!\" Irene rushes to Clare, who is standing by an open window. Suddenly, Clare falls out of the window from the top floor of the building to the ground below, where she is pronounced dead by the guests who eventually gather at the site. Whether she has fallen accidentally, was pushed by either Irene or Bellew, or committed suicide, is unclear. The book ends with Irene's fragmented anguish at Clare's death.\n\n\"Passing\" has been described as \"the tragic story of a beautiful light-skinned mulatto passing for white in high society.\" The tragic mulatto (also \"mulatta\" when referring to a woman) is a stock character in early African-American literature. Such accounts often featured the light-skinned offspring of a white slaveholder and his black slave, whose mixed heritage in a race-based society means that she is unable to identify or find a place with either blacks or whites. The resulting feeling of exclusion was portrayed as variably manifested in self-loathing, depression, alcoholism, sexual perversion, and attempts at suicide.\n\nOn the surface, \"Passing\" conforms to that stereotype in its portrayal of Clare Kendry, whose passing for white has tragic consequences; however, the book resists the conventions of the genre, as Clare refuses to feel the expected anguish at the betrayal of her black identity and socializes with blacks for the purposes of excitement rather than racial solidarity. Scholars have more generally considered \"Passing\" as a novel in which the major concern is not race. For instance, Claudia Tate describes the issue as \"merely a mechanism for setting the story in motion, sustaining the suspense, and bringing about the external circumstances for the story's conclusion.\"\n\nCatherine Rottenberg argues that Larsen's novella is a prime example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their struggle with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.\n\nAs scholars show, race is not the only primary concern in Nella Larsen's \"Passing\". Class is also a major aspect that is simultaneously developed. Both of the main characters Irene Redfield and Clare Kendry present a strong sense of class. They also demonstrate how they cross clearly defined class borders in order to obtain more power in their life.\n\nScholarly critics such as Mary Wilson have examined the character of Irene's maid Zulena, who demonstrates  the middle-class African-American family in the 1920’s. Irene opposed the idea of discrimination and racism towards the blacks but when it came to maintaining her social class she preferred the domesticity and servitude even if it was from the people from her own black race. Domesticity in the South was often associated with the black woman but Irene’s decides to maintain the power and class through servitude of another black woman. Wilson examines that the differences in class was not just embedded in the black versus white society but also within the single black race. Such difference can be seen as a conflict between Irene’s ideology and her actions when it comes to maintaining her status as a middle-class African-American. The class privilege is well defined through the skin color as Zulena is described as a “mahogany-coloured creature” which meant that she had no chance to pass like Irene as white and it automatically decides the role for the black colored woman to serve as a maid and belong to the inferior class. Although, Irene calls herself black but having an ability to pass as white makes her behave like white privileged woman because she happily accepts the servitude complicating the issue of race and class. Larsen introduces Zulena in the story as a “colored creature”,primarily from Irene’s perspective which depicts that Irene’s considers her servant from an inferior class and therefore decides to keep a certain distance from her maid.\n\nClare Kendry crosses social class binaries. Clare does not inhabit any particular social class but rather lives as both a working-class and a middle-class woman in the novel. Clare is born in a working-class family where her father is a janitor of the building that she lives in. In adulthood, she passes during her marriage to obtain the lifestyle of an upper middle-class woman. Despite having the luxury and comfort that she has always wanted but never had had in her childhood, Clare still longs for her childhood experiences and constantly visits Irene and her maid Zulena. Because Clare shares many experiences of the working-class, she feels very comfortable when talking to Zulena as if Zulena was her friend. Clare's desire to live in both social classes at the same time shows how these class boundaries are fluid.\n\nWhile Clare demonstrates her class binaries, Irene is very protective towards her own status quo. Irene grew up as a middle-class person and continues to live as such after marrying a doctor. Irene is more hesitant to cross between middle-class and working-class; she isolates herself and avoids all of the circumstances that she might be mistaken for a lower-class person. For example, during Irene's attempt to pass to become an elite white woman at Drayton hotel, she makes a clear distinction between herself and working-class individuals by showing her desire to be separated from the \"sweating masses\". Irene is also concerned that people at the Negro League Dance might mistake Clare for a prostitute. Throughout the novel, Irene seems comfortable living in a higher social class while Clare constantly crosses between the two classes.\n\nScholar Sami Schalk argues that the notion of eugenic ideology emerges in the novel. Eugenic Ideology assigns specific behavioral and physical traits to different distinctions of race, class, gender, and sexual identity. Both physical and behavioral features of this ideology are discussed by the main characters in \"Passing\", Irene and Clare. For example, several times in the novel, Irene acknowledges the way white people racially designate physical traits to African Americans in order to identify them. The concept of eugenic ideology also emerges when Clare's aunts assign her to a domestic servant role believing this would align with her skin color. Thus, the aunt's perceptions of Clare's work are distinctly categorized through race.\n\nSchalk further suggests that the novel resists these notions of eugenic ideology by emphasizing how characters pass fluidly between racial identities and resist clear categories of identity. In the novel, Clare Kendry hides her racial identity from her husband and is able travel to places where African Americans are not allowed entry because no one can denote her black heritage from her behavior. In addition, Irene notes several times in the novel that the physical traits white people assign to African Americans are ridiculous. She, too, is able to pass in places where African Americans are not allowed entry and therefore defies racial categorization. The novel resists eugenic distinctions by highlighting the fluid transitions between races.\n\nScholars have treated \"sexuality\" with caution and reticence especially during the Harlem Renaissance because the history of slavery and the objectification of the black women. Black novelists, especially female black novelists, had to be more discreet when writing about the sexuality of their characters. During this time, women, especially black women, were used as sexual objects. Due to sexual objectification, black novelists wanted to overcome the legacy of rape. They wanted to end the stereotypes of black women as \"sexual objects\" and to return to the \"timidity and modesty\" of Negro womanhood. The writers didn't want to repeat the experience of women's oppression, especially African-American women. McDowell believes that during the Harlem Renaissance female sexuality was acknowledged only in the advertising, beauty, and fashion industries and \"sexual pleasure, especially for black women, leads to the dangers of domination in marriage, repeated pregnancy, or exploitation and loss of status.\"\n\nAccording to Scholar, Deborah McDowell, Larsen wanted to tell the story of black women with sexual desires, but the novelist also had to be constrained in that she wanted to establish \"black women as respectable\" in black middle-class terms. As an example, in the novel, Irene is portrayed as sexually repressed. Irene has a tenuous relationship with her husband Brian. In fact, they have separate rooms. McDowell believes that Irene is confused by her sexual feelings for Clare, which are much more apparent. McDowell argues that the story is about \"Irene's awakening sexual desire towards Clare\".\n\nScholars have identified a homoerotic subtext between Irene and Clare, centered on the erotic undertones in Irene's descriptions of Clare and appreciation of her beauty. As scholar Deborah McDowell's writes \"the idea of bringing sexual attraction between two women to full narrative expression is, likewise, too dangerous a move, which helps to explain why critics have missed this aspect of the novel\". In that interpretation, the novel's central metaphor of \"passing\" under a different identity \"occurs at a surprisingly wide variety of levels,\" including sexual. This suggests that there are other forms of \"passing\" that take place in the novel that are not just based on race. Larsen has a clever way of \"deriving its surface theme and central metaphor-passing\", disguising the plots \"neatly\" and \"symmetrically\". The apparently sexless marriage between Brian and Irene (their separate bedrooms and identification as co-parents rather than sexual partners) allows Larsen to \"flirt, if only by suggestion, with the idea of a lesbian relationship between [Clare and Irene].\" In the novel, these sexual innuendos appear when Irene first lays eyes on Clare at the rooftop of the Drayton Hotel. The novel describes Clare as \"a sweetly scented woman in a fluttering dress of green chiffon whose mingled pattern of narcissuses, jonquils, and hyacinths was a reminder of pleasantly chill spring days\". These flowers symbolize the attraction Irene has for Clare. Jonquils and narcissuses, both represent excessive interest in one's physical appearance. This alludes to Irene's obsession and physical attraction for Clare. As the novel states, \"from the very beginning of their re-encounter, Irene is drawn to Clare like a moth to a flame\".\n\nThe character of her husband, Brian, has been subject to a similar interpretation: Irene's labeling of him as queer and his oft-expressed desire to go to Brazil, a country then widely thought to be more tolerant of homosexuality than the United States was, are given as evidence. It is also shown that Brazil is considered to be a place with more relaxed ideas about race. Irene begins to believe that Clare and Brian are having an affair to hide or distract from her own feelings for Clare. McDowell writes, \"the awakening of Irene's erotic feelings for Clare coincides with Irene's imagination of an affair between Clare and Brian\". Although she had no reason to accuse him, Irene did so to protect herself from her own sexual desires.\n\nScholars such as Claudia Tate and Helena Michie suggest there is a theme of jealousy throughout the novel. Both point to Irene's jealousy in terms of her appreciation for Clare's charisma and desirable appearance in the novel. As Clare meets Irene to go to the Negro Welfare League dance, Irene feels \"dowdy and commonplace\" in comparison to Clare, who she sees as \"exquisite, golden, fragrant, flaunting.\" The scholars stress that there are two aspects to this jealousy, with Irene exhibiting both bitterness in her perception of Clare, and simultaneously, feelings of affection and desire for her. Helena Michie categorizes the relationship as \"sororophobic\", a term she defines as a \"fear of one's sister.\" While Irene expresses jealousy in her admiration of Clare's beauty and social charms, she is also susceptible to their seduction and eventually begins to suspect that her husband Brian might be influenced by them as well. In her intensifying suspicions, Irene's jealousy develops into a fear of losing her family, and with it, the identity she has built for herself as a middle class black woman. Irene displays it here when deciding whether to expose Clare or not \"She was caught between two allegiances, different, yet the same. Herself. Her race. Race! The thing that bound and suffocated her. Whatever steps she took, or if she took none at all, something would be crushed. A person or the race. Clare, herself, or the race. Or, it might be, all three. Nothing, she imagined, was ever more completely sardonic.\" Larsen uses jealousy as the main source of conflict in the novel, and uses race as a vehicle for Irene to potentially rid herself of Clare. At this point in the story Irene realizes she can expose Clare's true racial identity to remove Clare from her life, and regain that security she desires more than anything. Albeit she feels jealousy and fear, out of loyalty for her race, Irene does not follow through with her thoughts of exposing Clare.\n\nWhile the novel primarily focuses on Irene's feelings of jealousy, Clare is also shown to be envious of Irene. Unlike Irene, however, Clare exhibits jealousy towards Irene's lifestyle. Clare perceives Irene as being close to her blackness and her community, a state that Clare has previously chosen to leave behind but strives to experience again. As Clare and Irene converse during Clare's first visit to Irene's home, Clare expresses her loneliness to Irene, contrasting her view of Irene's condition to Clare's own feelings of isolation: \"'How could you know? How could you? You're free. You're happy.'\" Clare expresses her own jealousy outwardly, even as the novel centers on Irene's inner turmoil.\n\nScholars such as Catherine Rottenberg examine how Larsen's characters struggle against race and gender norms of \"whiteness\" in the United States. Rottenberg shows how the main characters in the novel confront normative characteristics of white culture. Clare, who is of mixed race, chooses to identify with the white culture. Irene, who identifies as an African American, chooses to pass when she feels the need to blend into white culture. The essence of Rottenberg's scholarship shows how the novel's characters struggle against the desire for whiteness because of the positive stereotypes society has created around \"white\" identity. Clare's experience growing up with her white aunts, who treated her as a servant, directly impacts Clare's initial desire towards whiteness. Hence, she passes as a white woman, marries a white man, and forgets her African-American culture. Even though as a society the white race is the desirable race, Rottenberg explains how there are limitations put into place so the inferior race can never fully be white. For example, Clare has this desire to pass as a white woman because she believes that is the only way she will have a social power, but after reconnecting with her childhood friend Irene, she begins to struggle with her misplaced desire for whiteness and returns to her African-American identification. Seeing Irene sparks a desire in Clare to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Similarly, Irene identifies as black, but because she desires to feel safe and in control at all times in her life, she chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene's desire to be white comes from her wanting the middle-class lifestyle because it will give her the security she needs. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation, which in a way, makes her feel like her marriage and the life she knows at risk. Throughout Larsen's novel Rottenberg explains how Clare has evolved from wanting to achieve whiteness to reconnecting with the African-American culture, while Irene still has a desire to achieve \"whiteness\" for the feel secure.\n\nScholars such as Andrew W. Davis and Zahirah Sabir acknowledge Irene's psychology of safety and security, which likely originated from \"the threat of racism\" surrounding her family. In the novel, Irene states that she places security as the first priority in her life, on top of race and friendship in the novel.\n\nDavis states that the reason that Irene prioritizes security is she wants to protect her children from the social prejudices of the time. In addition, Irene wants Brian, her husband, to stay in New York as a doctor to provide security for her children. When Brian desires to leave for Brazil, Irene is anxious due to the fact that New York is still a white society, and is a familiar to her as an African-American middle-class woman. Clare's presence in Irene's life is a threat to this security. It makes Irene sense the insecurity of her marriage with her husband, Brian. And, it makes her acknowledge the reality of questions of race and class that surround her and her children's life.\n\nPassing, although focuses on the races aspect of the book, the chapters have talked about motherhood where both Irene and Clare are depicted to be mothers. It is interesting as Irene sees her sons, Junior and Theodore, differently than how Clare sees her daughter, Margery. \n\nIrene views her children as her security; she sees them as the reason Brian would stay with her. Their child ties them together and thus would make Brian stay with Irene even if they have a fallout. Irene holds her children dear to her and would do whatever she can for them. Irene is also the more protective parent compared to Brian; she wants to shield the children from the bad things in the world, like the knowledge of lynching and racism. Irene wants what's best for her children even if it means acting like specific topics do not affect them although they do, like racism.\n\nMeanwhile, Clare views motherhood as a requirement in her lifetime. She had Margery and no longer wants any more children as she cannot handle the suspense of knowing another babies' skin tone. She also mentions how \"children aren't everything\" this shows how she prioritizes her priorities, we see circumstances where she would leave her daughter with her husband and instead socialize with the black community.\n\nUnlike Irene, Clare actually rejects the thought of motherhood in fear that her identity might be revealed. Irene, on the other hand, is the devoted mother wanting the best for her boys, and always talking and thinking about them. Clare does not have the same attachments to Margery like Irene have to Junior and Ted as Clare sees motherhood as a binding thing that forces her to stay in a marriage she feels trapped in, while Irene is in the same boat Irene like this and uses it for her security.\n\n\"Passing\" was published in April 1929 by Knopf in New York City. Sales of the book were modest: Knopf produced three small print runs each under 2,000 copies. While early reviews were primarily positive, it received little attention beyond New York City.\n\nComparing it to Larsen's previous novel \"Quicksand\", Alice Dunbar-Nelson's review in \"The Washington Eagle\" began by declaring that \"Nella Larsen delights again with her new novel\". Writer and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois hailed it as the \"one of the finest novels of the year\" and believed that its limited success was due to its treating a \"forbidden subject,\" the marriage of a white man to a mixed-race girl who did not reveal her ancestry.\n\nA common criticism of the novel is that it ends too suddenly, without a full exploration of the issues it raises. Mary Rennels, writing in the \"New York Telegram\", said, \"Larsen didn't solve the problem [of passing]. Knocking a character out of a scene doesn't settle a matter.\" An anonymous reviewer for the \"New York Times Book Review\" similarly concluded that \"the most serious fault with the book is its sudden and utterly unconvincing close\"/but otherwise considered it an effective treatment of the topic. On the other hand, Dunbar-Nelson found that the ending confirmed to the reader that \"you have been reading a masterpiece all along.\"\n\nIn modern scholarship, Larsen is recognized as one of the central figures in the African-American, feminist and modernist canons, a reputation that is based on her two novels (\"Passing\" and \"Quicksand\") and some short stories. As of 2007, \"Passing\" is the subject of more than 200 scholarly articles and more than 50 dissertations, which offer a range of critical interpretations. It has been hailed as a text helping to \"create a modernist psychological interiority ... challenging marriage and middle-class domesticity, complexly interrogating gender, race, and sexual identity, and for redeploying traditional tropes—such as that of the tragic mulatta—with a contemporary and critical twist.\" However, literary critic Cheryl Wall summarizes the critical response to \"Passing\" as less favorable than to Larsen's first novel \"Quicksand\", citing the views of Amaritjit Singh in \"The Novels of the Harlem Renaissance\" (99), of Robert Bone in \"The Negro Novel in America\" (102), and of Hoyt Fuller in his \"Introduction\" to \"Passing\" (14).\" On one hand, the significance of sexual jealousy in the story has been seen to detract from the topic of racial passing; conversely, even if racial passing is accurately treated in the novel, it is considered a historically specific practice and so \"Passing\" appears dated and trivial.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n", "id": "7730261", "categories": ["American novellas", "Novels set in New York City", "African-American literature", "Harlem in fiction", "Multiracial literature", "Harlem Renaissance", "1929 American novels", "Novels set in the 1920s", "African-American novels", "American LGBT novels"], "title": "Passing (novel)"}

The species of the \"Aratinga solstitialis\" complex, were retained in this genus, while other former \"Aratinga\" species were moved to \"Eupsittula\" (brownish-throated species), \"Psittacara\" (pale-beaked species) and \"Thectocercus\" (blue-crowned parakeet). Furthermore, the closely related nanday parakeet (\"A. nenday\") and the dusky-headed parakeet (\"A. weddellii\") are placed in this genus.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7730309", "text": "Colias\n\nColias is a genus of butterflies in the family Pieridae. They are often called clouded yellows; the North American name \"sulphurs\" is elsewhere used for Coliadinae in general. The closest living relative is the genus \"Zerene\", which is sometimes included in \"Colias\".\nThis genus occurs throughout the Holarctic, including the arctic regions. They are also found in South America, Africa, China and India. Their caterpillars feed on certain Fabaceae, for example vetches (\"Vicia\"). While most are thus beneficial by keeping weeds at bay, some occasionally become nuisance pests on crops like alfalfa. In some species, the wings of males have brilliant ultraviolet reflection, while those of females do not. Adults of both sexes have various colour forms.\n\nMost if not all species of this genus, as usual for Coliadinae, do not sequester toxins or other noxious compounds from their food plants. They are therefore a well-loved prey item of insectivores as compared to \"Pieris\" of the related Pierinae. They make up this disadvantage by being more nimble and better able to evade attacks by would-be predators.\n\nNotable lepidopterologists who did many studies on this genus included Julius Röber, J. Malcolm Fawcett, George B. Johnson and Henry Rowland-Brown.\n\nHybridization runs rampant in these polytypic and clinal butterflies, confounding molecular phylogenetics studies. In general, cladistic analyses of only one type of data (particularly mtDNA sequences) cannot be considered reliable. Regardless, the evolutionary distance within some \"species\" is so large that cryptic speciation rather than (or in addition to) interbreeding seems to be the cause. For example, the Beringian populations traditionally assigned to the northern clouded yellow (\"C. hecla\") could warrant recognition as a species; hybridization between North American and Asian populations seems to have played a role in their evolution, but as a whole they appear to be a rather old and distinct lineage.\n\nListed alphabetically:\n\n\n\"Colias\" are usually some shade of yellow, orange or white.

As a member of the faculty of the College of Education, he designed and directed the internationally recognized doctoral and master's programs in Teaching English as a Second/Foreign Languages (TESL/TEFL), which he led for more than twenty years. Jenks served as major advisor for fifty doctoral dissertations and more than 300 master's degree recipients. He founded and directed The Center for Intensive English Studies (CIES) at FSU from 1979 to 2002. He was an adjunct professor at Flagler College, a Fulbright Senior Specialist, a legal expert witness in second language assessment and an advocate in the Florida legislature for public-school English language learners. He was born in Buffalo, New York.\n\nIn 1982, he designed and directed the first MA-TESOL program delivered by an American university totally outside the United States. Sponsored by ARAMCO, the Saudi Arabian oil company, the innovative program graduated 72 students during the five-year contract. He and Dr. James D. Brown, the program coordinator, were assisted by numerous TESOL experts including Drs. Stephen Gaies, Thomas Buckingham and David Eskey.\n\nFrom late 1996 through 2000, he was the Director of Florida State University Panama Canal Branch campus in the Panama Canal Zone which, via a long-term contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, served as the Canal Zone's primary university, offering degree programs to military personnel and families, Canal Zone employees and residents, and Panamanian citizens. His mission was to seek ways for the university to continue operations after the reversion of the Canal Zone to the Republic of Panama in late 1999. The politically sensitive goal was achieved with support from the President and Legislative Assembly of Panama, USAID, Panamanian alumni and the U.S. Embassy. Former U.S. Ambassador to Panama, Simon Ferro, stated in 2000 that \"The largest remaining U.S. footprints in the Republic of Panama are the Embassy and Florida State University-Panama.\" Jenks was instrumental in acquiring from the Panamanian government exclusive use of the former campus of the Panama Canal College, formerly the Canal Zone's community college. Today, FSU-Panama is chartered as a private Panamanian university, offering degree programs under an academic accord with FSU.\n\nHe was founding editor of the quarterly \"American Foreign Language Teacher\" from 1969–74, edited twenty books and monographs on language education for Advancement Press of America, and served as editor of Heinle & Heinle's Foreign and Second Language Education series from 1978-81.\n\nHis professional writing can be found in journals ranging from \"Classical Outlook\" to \"TESOL Journal\", and in numerous books, festschrift and anthologies.

This is the last cartoon in which Kent Rogers performed voices, as he died in a training flight accident on July 9, 1944.\n\nBeaky Buzzard is sent to bring home something to eat. While his brothers fetch a milk cow (with farmer attached), a string of circus elephants (including a baby one brandishing a banner reading \"I am NOT Dumbo\", a reference to the Disney film of the same name) and a dog attached to a fire hydrant, Beaky manages to capture a baby bumble bee; while flying back carrying it he sings \"I'm bringing home a baby bumble bee\" to the tune of \"The Arkansas Traveler\". A larger bee then comes and stings Beaky, who falls down near a lake. There he sees the small head of what turns out to be a large dragon. Beaky starts running from the dragon, and the scene changes to the mother buzzard worrying about her son not returning home until late at night. When he comes, she is both glad that he came and angry that he brought nothing for dinner. However, when the camera moves down, it is revealed that he has eventually caught the dragon, who dismisses the mother's claim by saying \"Well now, I wouldn't say that!\" (a la Mr. Peavey of \"The Great Gildersleeve\").\n\n\n", "id": "7730324", "categories": ["1945 animated films", "1940s American animated films", "Films directed by Bob Clampett", "Warner Bros.

It was the location of the Wilcox, Crittenden company, a marine hardware firm. The historic district listing included four contributing buildings and three other contributing sites.\n\nThe mill complex consists of four surviving mill buildings, built between 1814 and 1917, and foundational remnants of others, as well as two brownstone dams. Mill A, built in 1814 to house weaving operations, was converted into an office when larger facilities were built. Mill B, located to its north, is long, and was built between 1901 and 1912. Mill C is a concrete block structure built in 1907, and is long. Mill D stands across the ravine of Pamachea Creek from Mill C, and is the youngest of the four buildings.\n\nThis building is sited on the north bank of Pameacha Creek. It is located in a commercial and industrial area and faces the busy intersection of Warwick and South Main Streets. Nearby are related, later factory buildings. A modern solar-energized bank is located across the intersection to the west.\n\nThe main part of this structure was erected in 1814 by John Watkinson as a woolen factory. Pamecha Creek was a prime source of water power in Middletown; a mill had occupied this site since the 1650s. Following Watkinson's death in 1836, this building was occupied by another woolen business, known as The Pamecha Manufacturing Company.\n\nIn 1849 William Walter Wilcox, a young and aggressive factory worker, went into business with Ira Penfield, his employer. Together they continued manufacturing Penfield's recently patented grommet (a small metal device used in the raising and lowering of sails) in the basement of this building, and established the firm of Penfield and Wilcox. Wilcox then went on the road, successfully selling this new device, and establishing a coast-to-coast reputation. When Penfield retired in 1857, Wilcox took in Joseph Hall Jr. as a partner and the firm known as Wilcox and Hall was established. Hall left the business in 1867. in 1869 the firm acquired the name by which it has been known for over one hundred years, The Wilcox, Crittenden and Company. The firm's prominent managers at this time were William Walter Wilcox, Albert R. Crittenden (a former Middletown Mayor), E. Bound Chaffee, and Homer Churchill. This firm brought force and strength to the ships' chandlery business. They constructed additions to the existing structures to meet their rapidly growing needs. Their success was attributed to honesty, paying close attention to the business and having a good understanding of maritime needs.\n\nOn a summer night in 1907 a devastating fire attacked the premises. Virtually every building and its contents on Pamecha ravine was destroyed, except for a small brick structure and the addition to the south. This determined firm rebuilt within two years, without losing a customer or laying off an employee. Except for this building and a slightly larger and later structure on the south side of the Pamecha Creek, all the structures related to the firm were built after the 1907 fire.\n\nThis -story brick structure displays some of its early exterior features; brownstone sills and lintels, and two corbelled chimneys. The windows on the west facade were lengthened, the brownstone lintels removed and replaced by segmental-arched brick lintels. The cupola was replaced. The wing, attached to its south wall, probably dates deom the late 19th century. More decorative, it displays corbelled brick work and an unusual arched window on the west facade. A large mural of a clipper ship is painted on the south wall.\n\nThe Pamecha Creek played an important role in Middletown's early manufacturing operations. The many water-powered factories located on its banks were largely responsible for this city's industrial prosperity in the early nineteenth century. This building is one of the few survivors of that prosperous era.\n\nThe site is additionally significant as an archeological site. Not only has it been in continuous use since 1650, but documents indicate that much of the machinery and tools damaged in the 1907 fire were not removed from the steep ravine.\n\nThe property has been converted into an apartment building and is in good condition.\n\n\nMiddletown, Connecticut Historical and Architectural Resources.

During the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, he collaborated extensively with the German occupation forces. He was the husband of Florentine Rost van Tonnigen.\n\nMeinoud Marinus Rost van Tonningen was born on 19 February 1894 on the island of Java, in the city of Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia). He was the son of KNIL general Marinus Bernardus Rost van Tonningen, who had distinguished himself suppressing the revolts against Dutch rule on Lombok, Aceh and Bali. After high school he completed legal studies at the University of Leiden.\n\nIn the periods 1923–1928 and 1931–1936, he was representative of the League of Nations in Vienna. His job was to monitor the Austrian financial policy. While stationed in Vienna, he developed strong anti-semitic and anti-communist convictions. He became close friends with Engelbert Dollfuss, who became Chancellor of Austria in 1932 and who was murdered in 1934.\n\nHe became a member of the NSB on 7 August 1936 after returning from Austria. He won a seat in Parliament in the elections that year and became the leader of his parliamentary party in the Dutch House of Representatives.\n\nHe also became editor-in-chief of the NSB party newspaper, \"Het Nationale Dagblad\", which he made into a vessel of his own ideas to the dismay of the NSB party leadership. Rost van Tonningen was obsessed with Germany and the \"Greater German Idea\", while Anton Mussert, the leader of the NSB, had more affinity with the idea of Fascism as carried out by Benito Mussolini in Italy.\n\nIt was mainly Rost van Tonningen's influence that caused the NSB to become more openly anti-semitic; Rost van Tonningen's anti-semitism was more radical than NSB leader Anton Mussert. Because of his influence. the NSB became closer to the German Nazi Party, the NSDAP.\n\n1939 saw Rost van Tonningen establish the paramilitary organisation – the Mussert guards. Many members of this organisation later became members of the Nederlandsche SS. Rost van Tonningen's request to be admitted as a member of the SS \"Westland\" regiment was at first denied, because he had been born in the Dutch East Indies, and was unable to obtain documents showing that his family had 150 years of \"pure Aryan blood\". However, from 1943, Indos (Dutch Eurasians) could join the lower ranks of the Waffen SS. (Whereas those deemed to be \"Native Indonesians\", with no or little European ancestry, were still not allowed.) In 1944, Rost van Tonningen again applied for membership of the SS, and was admitted.\n\nDuring the German occupation of the Netherlands, Rost van Tonningen was appointed \"liquidation commissar\" for all Marxist organisations by Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the Austrian administrator for the Netherlands.\n\nThis was targeted especially at the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP), the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSAP), and the Communist Party (CPN). The CPN had to be liquidated, the SDAP had to be \"reconstructed\" based on National Socialist doctrine. This reconstruction failed because the SDAP had destroyed most of its archives and administration papers.\n\nThe SDAP leadership refused to cooperate, and during regional meetings of the SDAP it was announced that the SDAP would not collaborate with the German occupation forces. Virtually all SDAP affiliated organisations refused to cooperate with Rost van Tonningen's attempts to 'nazify' them. Most organisations (e.g., Labourers Sports Association, musical organisations) chose to dissolve themselves rather than become part of the Nazi hierarchy. On 5 July 1941, the SDAP was disbanded, together with all other remaining political parties.\n\nOn 26 March 1941, Rost van Tonningen was appointed to the posts of Secretary-General of the Finance ministry and President of the Dutch National Bank, the \"Nederlandsche Bank\". During his tenure in these functions, the Germans held the Netherlands financially responsible for the costs of the occupation of their country. The total cost of this to the Dutch society was calculated by the Dutch government after the war as being 9,488,000,000 Reichsmark. Besides this amount, an amount of 5,750,000,000 Reichsmark of loans made by the Netherlands to Germany was never repaid, so a total amount of 14,500,000,000 Reichsmark flowed to Germany. (Comparison: France 43,250,000,000 and Belgium 11,070,000,000.)\n\nOn 1 April 1941, the currency barriers between the Netherlands and the Third Reich were removed, and on 1 September 1941, the last obstructions in the currency markets between the two countries were finally removed. This meant that the Germans could trade the gold of the Dutch National Bank for paper Reichsmarks.\n\nThe other financial heads of occupied territories were not as eager as Rost van Tonningen to remove the barriers and the Netherlands could not spend the Reichsmarks obtained in this way to pay these other countries. The other territories brought their Reichsmarks to the Netherlands to pay their foreign debt; Germany, Denmark, Hungary and Occupied France all paid their debts in this way. This and the purchase of Dutch goods for Reichsmarks by the Germans made the Dutch balance of Reichsmarks grow from 83,000,000 (March 1941) to 3,646,000,000 (September 1941). Rost van Tonningen in the meantime kept printing large amounts of Dutch money. This led to large inflation figures.\n\nAs Secretary-General for Special Economic Affairs, Rost van Tonningen was involved in the establishment of the \"Nederlandse Oostcompagnie\" (Dutch East Company), an organisation involved in the reconstruction of the Ukraine. The efforts of this company were an abysmal failure.\n\nOn 5 September 1944, \"Dolle Dinsdag\" (Mad Tuesday), Rost van Tonningen fled with a number of other Dutch Collaborators, fearing the rapidly advancing Allied armies. He turned up again a few days later, but was fired from his position as successor to the NSB leadership by Anton Mussert after writing an article in which he praised the members of the Dutch NSB youth organisation (\"Nationale Jeugdstorm\", National Youth Storm) who had joined the Hitlerjugend division.\n\nIn the summer of 1944, Rost van Tonningen was trained to be an officer in the first battalion of the \"Landstorm Nederland\", a Dutch paramilitary defense organisation. In March 1945 he left for the frontlines, which ran through the middle of the Netherlands, in the Betuwe. On 8 May 1945 he was taken prisoner by Canadian troops, and was held in a prisoner camp in Elst. From there he was transferred to Utrecht and on 24 May 1945 he was moved to the prison in Scheveningen. Rost van Tonningen allegedly committed suicide there by jumping from a balcony in the prison on 6 June 1945. There have been persistent rumors, but no proof, that he did not jump by himself. He never stood trial for his actions.\n\nHis second wife, Florentine Rost van Tonningen, continued to promote pro-German and National Socialist views, denying the Holocaust and regretting the fall of the Third Reich and any threat to racial purity. One of their sons, Ebbe Rost van Tonningen, published a memoir in 2012 about his childhood, \"In Niemandsland\" (\"In no man's land\").\n", "id": "7730405", "categories": ["Nazi propagandists", "Nazi collaborators who committed suicide", "National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands politicians", "Dutch anti-communists", "20th-century Dutch criminals", "Dutch collaborators with Nazi Germany", "People from Surabaya", "1945 deaths", "Dutch propagandists", "1894 births"], "title": "Meinoud Rost van Tonningen"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7730454", "text": "Combat Arms Training and Maintenance\n\nCombat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM), or simply Combat Arms are United States Air Force Security Forces personnel who train base populace on the use of small arms, oversee, maintain and repair all small arms in the U.S. Air Force inventory. AFSC 3P0X1B, SEI 312 (TSgt and above) are Security Forces personnel who completed the 7 week Combat Arms Apprentice Course (Lackland AFB) and conduct marksmanship training to prepare all Air Force personnel for home station and deployment operations. Combat Arms specialists lead, manage, supervise and implement small arms weapons training programs. Their duties include operating firing ranges and associated facilities, enforcing range safety, inspecting/repairing weaponry, performing preventative maintenance, developing/utilizing training aides and determining training/maintenance resource requirements. Combat Arms personnel also provide training in safeguarding weapons, ammunition and equipment; instructing small arms weapons qualification training and providing guidance on weapons placement to SF and other ground defense force commanders. Combat Arms Instructors are the Air Forces small arms weapons Subject Matter Experts (SME).\n\nDuring the Korean War, several incidents occurred which called attention to the small arms training provided to Air Force personnel. The most significant was the tragedy at Kimpo Air Base, Korea, which was overrun by a numerically superior Chinese communist force. The Air Police Squadron was so overwhelmed that they were forced to fight a rear guard action before being annihilated. The general base population was then easily defeated before reinforcements arrived to drive the enemy back. The remaining personnel found alive by the Chinese were hanged in the main hangar on Kimpo. This hangar still stands today as a memorial to those who died without a chance to fight.\n\nThe resulting investigation revealed serious deficiencies in the way small arms training was perceived and carried out in the Air Force. Prior to the Korean War, no formal program of weapons training existed. One result was the inability of the majority of personnel at Kimpo to successfully defend themselves and the base. The majority of the base weapons were inoperable due to lack of maintenance. The few serviceable ones were of little use as personnel were not trained in their use, unable to even load or aim them. Only the Air Police were routinely trained in marksmanship and maintenance of small arms.\n\nPlease note not everyone agrees the \"Kimpo Massacre\" occurred. The US Air Force Police Alumni Association website addresses this claim on their website. http://www.usafpolice.org/korea.html\n\nThe experience of the Korean War encouraged General LeMay, then Vice Chief of Staff and former Strategic Air Command commander, to pursue a course that was to change the way weapons training was received by Air Force personnel. In 1958, twenty-five experienced USAF competitive shooters were selected to become the initial instructor cadre of the USAF Marksmanship Center located at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. The marksmanship program was designed by Colonel Tom Kelly, former Commander of Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, and under the direction of Colonel Peter W. Agnell. The initial cadre attended the U.S. Army's advanced rifle marksmanship coaches class at Fort Benning, Georgia from 26 January to 15 February 1958. The three-week training course included coaching techniques, range management, and procedures for the preparation of marksmanship training programs. The purpose of the initial cadre was to train Small Arms instructors and gunsmiths for assignment to all Air Force bases. With these personnel as a core for the newly formed USAF Marksmanship Center, bases throughout the world began selecting personnel to be sent to the center for training. On 5 November 1958, the first class was conducted consisting of 32 students. The initial course was 12 weeks in duration and graduated qualified Small Arms instructors who returned to their bases to establish local Marksmanship Programs. The new instructors were awarded the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 753X0 and the expanded program included intensive training for aircrews, Air Police, Air Base Defense personnel to improve the overall weapons capability of all Air Force personnel.\n\nIn 1965, the USAF Marksmanship unit's name was formally changed to Small Arms Marksmanship Training Unit (SAMTU). This change designated what weapons the career field was responsible to train. Besides meeting local training objectives and conducting competitive rifle and pistol matches, Small Arms specialists set up and operated specialty courses. The USAF Sniper School, located at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, was one of these and existed from 1965 to 1967. Its purpose was to train personnel to carry out their assigned duties effectively in the Republic of Vietnam. There was also a 72-hour Southeast Asia (SEA) course in operation through 1971. Its purpose was to prepare all Air Force personnel en route to Southeast Asia. [NOTE: Some Air Force Snipers, who were assigned to the Air Commando units and were not instructors, were sent to the Marine Sniper School during 1965-1968.]\n\nControl of the marksmanship program moved from Washington D.C. to Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, in 1978. This move was to enhance the program management. The career field again felt another change in 1982 when it was functionally restructured to report to the Air Force Office of Security Police. With this change came the re designation to \"Combat Arms Training and Maintenance\" (CATM).\n\nOn November 1, 1993, the AFSC was changed to more closely align the career field with the Security Police career field. The new designation was 3P1X1 for CATM instructors and 3P1X1A for gunsmiths. The career field also shared the same functional badge with Security Police and the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), which designated the basic level, the 7-level, and Senior NCO Academy graduate level.

The organization was founded in 1985 by Howard Brodsky, Alan Greenberg, and Sandy Mishkin. In 2016 Carpet One had over 1,300 stores. Carpet One Floor & Home and its parent, CCA Global Partners, are based in Manchester, New Hampshire and St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe Carpet One organization was the first business formed by CCA Global Partners, a cooperative incubator founded in 1984. Under the banner of CCA Global Partners, the Carpet One model was used by its founders to found a total of fourteen affiliated cooperatives for the floor covering industry, mortgage banks (Lenders One), bicycle shops (The Biking Solution, later The Bike Cooperative) and lighting retailers (Lighting One).\n\nCarpet Co-op of America launched in 1984 as a cooperative for independent flooring retailers by Alan Greenberg and Howard Brodsky, who had been working together in the early 1980s as co-chairmen of a national flooring association. Both were presidents of the American Floor Covering Association as well as owners of independent retail flooring stores. At this time Brodsky owned three stores in New Hampshire while Greenberg owned five stores in the St. Louis area.\n\nBrodsky and Greenberg spent about one year developing their business model, deciding between becoming a franchise or starting a co-op. They decided to create a model that incorporated the best of franchising together with the best elements of cooperative models. They decided on a model with three pillars: buying, marketing and management.\n\nEarly in the genesis of Carpet One, Sandy Mishkin, a carpet retailer from Atlanta, joined the organization. Mishkin is a co-founder and president of CCA Global partners.\n\nCarpet One was founded in 1985 with thirteen initial members. Each store had to pay $12,000 to join, but there was no monthly franchise payment. By the end of that year the cooperative had retail sales volume of $25 million for its 26 members. By the spring of 1986 there were approximately fifty members.\n\nFrom the outset, the company sought to innovate, uniquely introducing warranties such as guaranteeing customer satisfaction, promising to replace carpet if the customer was not completely satisfied. They also instituted a lifetime installation guarantee. These two guarantees gave the members of the cooperative a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\n\nIn 1989 Carpet One launched the “Good as Gold” program for their membership. This program independently tested their carpets, promising they would not matt or become crushed, verifying them as “Good as Gold.” Together with a ten-year insurance policy against crushing, the certification boosted sales by 25%.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1990 Carpet One grew at an average rate of 75 new retail stores each year. During this time, the company held two conventions each year to evaluate and implement improvements in their products, performance and profitability.\n\nBy 1995 Carpet One had 525 retail store members with total sales of $1.5 billion. In 1995, Carpet One created the Installation Excellence program that rates the levels of service based on consumer surveys and provides certification for salespeople and installers.\n\nIn 1996 Carpet One obtained licensing of exclusive brands such as Bigelow and LEES for Living carpet, which came with a 25-year stain warranty. They also had exclusive product placement for Liz Clairborne Flooring.\n\nIn 1999, Florence Henderson became a celebrity spokesperson for Carpet One.\n\nIn 2001, Carpet One launched the SelectAFloor selling system. The merchandising system was developed over four years and was intended to make life easier for the consumer and the sales person by dividing carpet offerings into six lifestyles.\n\nCarpet One entered into a partnership with Liz Claiborne in 2002 to be the exclusive seller of the fashion designer’s new flooring line.\n\nIn 2004 Carpet One commissioned architectural and design firm FRCH Worldwide to create a showroom that would embody the Carpet One brand. The result was Destination Carpet One—a concept that allowed the showcasing of products in a consumer-friendly way. \n\nIn 2006, Carpet One added “Floor & Home” to their name to represent the expanded offerings beyond carpet, such as hardwood, tile, and other home products.\n\nThe Healthier Living Installation system developed by Carpet One Floor & Home helps differentiate Carpet One Floor & Home stores by focusing on the quality of the installation. The program launched in 2011.\n\nCarpet One founders Howard Brodsky and the late Alan Greenberg were inducted into the Cooperative Hall of Fame of the US National Cooperative Business Association in 2009.\n\nIn 2000, Carpet One launched The Magic Carpet Time Tour as part of a new community relations program. The project was developed in conjunction with Radio Disney and promoted reading to elementary school children. Carpet One members nominated local schools to be visited by Radio Disney performers and provide carpet samples to the students to sit on during the presentation.\n\nIn 2004, Carpet One launched the Carpet One Welcomes Your Support program to raise funds for breast cancer research through the sales of pink ribbon welcome mats. By 2016, the campaign had raised nearly $1 million for various breast cancer research charities. The program currently supports the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF).\n\nAlso in 2004, Carpet One hosted a contest among schools to win library makeovers. They completed makeovers in 85 schools in 33 states and 3 Canadian provinces on \"USA Weekend\" magazine’s national “Make A Difference Day.” The initiative was recognized by \"USA Weekend\" as part of their 14th Annual Make A Difference Day Awards.\n\n\n\n\nCarpet One has regional content coordinators working with individual stores helping them with their content and online presence.\n\nCarpet One Floor & Home won 2014 PR Daily’s Social Media Awards in the category of Best Use of YouTube for its \"Beautiful Design Made Simple\" video series.\n\nJohn & Beth Hughes of O’Brien’s Carpet One Floor & Home, Colorado Springs, CO, earned the Alan Greenberg Award in 2017.\n\nGuy & Michelle Pylypiw of Oshawa Carpet One Floor & Home, Oshawa, ON, received the 2017 Wally Hileman Award.\n\nMembers of Carpet One vote for Partner of the Year prior to the annual convention. The award recognizes the business that has had the greatest impact on the Carpet One Floor & Home membership during the previous year. Shaw Industries was the recipient three years in a row, from 2011–2013. Shaw also won this award four years in a row, from 2014–2017.\n\nIn 2017 the Carpenter Company won the Specialty Partner of the Year award for their innovative carpet cushion products.\n", "id": "7730500", "categories": ["Retailers' cooperatives in the United States", "Companies established in 1985"], "title": "Carpet One"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7730606", "text": "Hang (instrument)\n\nThe Hang (; plural form: Hanghang) is a musical instrument in the idiophone class created by Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer in Bern, Switzerland. The name of their company is PANArt Hangbau AG. The Hang is sometimes referred to as a \"hang drum\", but the inventors consider this a misnomer and strongly discourage its use.\nThe instrument is constructed from two half-shells of deep drawn, nitrided steel sheet glued together at the rim leaving the inside hollow and creating the shape of a convex lens. The top (\"Ding\") side has a center 'note' hammered into it and seven or eight 'tone fields' hammered around the center. The bottom (\"Gu\") is a plain surface that has a rolled hole in the center with a tuned note that can be created when the rim is struck.\n\nThe Hang uses some of the same basic physical principles as a steelpan, but modified in such a way as to act as a Helmholtz resonator. The creation of the Hang was the result of many years of research on the steelpan and other instruments. The inventors of the Hang have continued to refine the shape and materials and have produced several variations over the years.\n\nThe name \"Hang\" comes from a Bernese German word which has a double-meaning, one of which is \"hand\" and the other \"hillside\" referring to its convex shape. It is a registered trademark and property of PANArt Hangbau AG.\n\nGrowth of a worldwide interest in the Hang created a group of similar instruments which are referred to as \"handpans\", a term coined in 2007 by the American steelpan producer Pantheon Steel.\n\nThe Hang is typically played resting on the player's lap. The Hang is generally played with the hands and fingers instead of mallets. This lighter means of playing produces an overtone-rich sound that could be considered softer and warmer than the bright sound of a mallet-based traditional steelpan.\n\nThe top (Ding) side of the Hang, depending on how it is played, can sound like a harp, bells, or harmonically tuned steelpans. The notes are laid out in a cross pattern in the tone circle from low to high so that with a specific orientation of the Hang, the player can ascend or descend the scale by alternating using the left and right hands to strike the tone fields. Each tone field has multiple overtones oriented specifically in the flattened field with a dome at the center. Typically there is a fundamental tone, an overtone tuned to an octave above that fundamental, and an additional overtone a perfect fifth above that octave (twelfth or tritave). The orientation is fairly consistent across the fields on each Hang so that the overtones can be highlighted, muted, or extracted based on how and where the player strikes the tone field.\n\nThe bottom side of the Hang has a round opening, the Gu, producing together with the air in the cavity a Helmholtz resonance similar to a ghatam or an udu. In the second generation, Integral Hang and Free Integral Hang adjustment of the size of the Gu (by partially blocking it with either a hand, or the legs) can generate a sympathetic D from the Helmholtz resonance, which introduces subtle layers of cross complexities in the resonance of the instrument as notes are played on the Ding side. In the first- and second-generation models there is a single high note with a long sustain that can be generated by striking the rim of the hole on the 'Gu' side. In the Integral Hang there are two notes that can be generated (F and F). The Hang can also be used as a friction idiophone. Shaker-like sounds can be made by sliding a hand across the surface, and it can also ring like a singing bowl by using skin (a hand) or a bow.\n\nThe Hang was developed in the year 2000 and introduced at the Musikmesse Frankfurt in 2001. It is in diameter and has a height of . The two deep drawn steel hemispheres of the Hang are hardened by a process known as gas nitridization. The side considered the bottom has an opening (Gu) in the center which allows the generation of the bass note through Helmholtz resonance. When it is played in a damped way it can change in pitch similar to a talking drum. On the top are seven or eight notes arranged in a tone circle in zigzag fashion from low to high. All are tuned harmonically (with fundamental, octave and the fifth above the octave) around a low note (Ding) at the center of the tone circle. Each creation is numbered and signed.\n\nThere are only two people who built Hanghang, the inventors Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer. They have a small workshop in Bern where every Hang has been created.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005 the first generation Hang was offered in multiple scales ranging up to 45 different sound models. The Hang makers took their initial inspiration from ethnomusicological roots with models such as the Aeolian, Ake Bono, Hijaz, Melog, Pygmy, and Zhi Diao. From 2001 to 2004 each Hang had eight tone fields in the circle. In 2005 PANArt was able to lower the tones on the Hang significantly in what they referred to as the \"Low Hang\" with the Ding tuned to F, E or E. It was offered in two versions with eight or seven tone fields in the circle. In the first generation each creation was numbered, the name of the sound model was written, and a signature of either Felix Rohner or Sabina Schärer was on a small note pasted on the inside of the top (Ding) surface.\n\nIn the spring of 2006 the Hang makers presented a new generation of Hang. The \"new generation\" instruments (often referred to as \"second generation\") have a surface coating of annealed brass over the nitrided steel as well as a ring of brass around the circumference of the Hang. From the many different scales the Hang makers reduced to a structure with one type of central note (Ding) at D. All new generation models have two A notes (A and A) as well as another D (D) in the tone circle around the Ding. The remaining notes were mixed into several different configurations. The majority of second generation Hanghang were built with seven tone fields in the circle. Older Hanghang had tone fields with the oval indentation oriented radially towards the Ding, with the 2007 models (as well as the Integral Hang) the tone fields are angled at about 45° from a line drawn from the Ding to the edge. They also started marking the individual serial number on the inside of the Gu opening and signing each Hang at the outside edge of the Gu side of the Hang. No sound model names were officially given to the second generation models.\n\nIn the spring of 2008 the Hang makers announced a new version, the Integral Hang. Numbers began again with an H in front (H1, H2, etc.) and with the first Integral Hang dated in November 2007. Several changes marked the Integral Hang. There was only one scale with seven tone fields in the cycle (D Ding, A, B, C, D, E, F, A) and no other sound models offered. The Gu hole was adjusted to a subtly oval shape to improve the tuning of the three partials D, F and an F of the Gu neck. Significant changes were made to the Ding (center note on the top). A circular indentation in the dome was made and has a texture of brass applied, annealed, and then lacquered. Also changes to the shoulder area between the flattened area of the Ding and the notes in the tone circle were implemented so that the transition was more gradual than in the 2nd generation Hanghang. The PANArt logo, serial number, date of finalization, and signatures of the Hang makers were placed on Gu side of the Hang near the equator where the two shells meet.\n\nBy developing the Integral Hang, Rohner and Schärer distanced themselves from the idea of building an instrument for the needs of professional musicians. Their aims and ambitions were published in a 'Letter from the Hangbauhaus': \n\nThis model has been available since April 2010. Compared to its predecessor, the Free Integral Hang features a few construction changes. First of all, there is no longer a brass ring around the seam connecting the ding and gu shells. Furthermore, the dome of the ding is not brass-coated anymore and is characterized by a double offset (a triple dome). The Free Integral Hanghang are tuned without the use of tuning devices. The pitch of the Ding differs from one instrument to another and varies around the tone D. The tones in the tone circle relative to the Ding correspond to those of the Integral Hang.\n\nIn the free tuning of a Hang, the focus is not about the precise mathematical frequency ratios of the partials of a tone field, but on the impact of the entire sound. Trinidad's steelpan tuners already slightly detuned partial tones to attain the characteristic sound of their own instruments. In an acoustic-mathematical analysis, Anthony Achong substantiated that this detuning is the most important parameter in influencing the structure of a steelpan tone: the duration of the partials as well as the amplitude and frequency modulations. By foregoing a tuning device for the Free Integral Hang, the Hang tuners are free to systematically make use of this parameter and to concentrate on the artistic design of the sound structure during the entire tuning process.\n\nAs of December 2013 PANArt announced that the Hang would no longer be made, as the PANArt tuners were completely concentrated on a new different instrument, the Gubal. In the following years PANArt developed a number of other instruments called \"Hang Gudu\", \"Hang Urgu\", \"Hang Bal\" and \"Hang Gede\" as well as a number of string instruments and created a collective improvised music form played with these \"Pang instruments\".\n\n", "id": "7730606", "categories": ["Idiophones struck directly", "Pitched percussion", "Percussion instruments invented since 1800", "Melodic percussion", "Struck idiophones played by hand"], "title": "Hang (instrument)"}

Arnott was promoted to surgeon on 23 August 1799. He followed his unit to Holland and was present at the storming of the entrenchments at Krabbendam. He was later transferred to the 20th Regiment of Foot at Menorca and was present at the storming of Alexandria. He continued to served with the 20th Regiment at Malta, Sicily and Calabria and was present at the Battle of Maida.\n\nHe continued to serve with the 20th Regiment at Vimiera and in the retreat from the Battle of Corunna. He followed his unit in the Walcheren expedition where his military unit was decimated by fever. In 1812, Arnott, served with the Duke of Wellington in his campaigns until the end of the war, including the battle of Vittoria, in the Pyrenees and in India.\n\nAs the fourth and last of Napoleon's physicians on St. Helena, Arnott arrived, following his regiment in 1819, and on 21 April 1821 visited Napoleon in his professional capacity. He quickly established excellent relations with the Emperor, becoming his most trusted doctor, and attended to him until his death. The Emperor was bedridden for some days as a result of persistent vomiting and Arnott prescribed potions, with no initial results, eventually prescribing a sedative generally thought to be opium, which relieved the Emperor's symptoms. On 3 May, Arnott prescribed calomel for the Emperor's constipation with good results. Prior to his death, Napoleon ordered a snuff box brought to him and carved an \"N\" with a pen knife and presented it to Dr. Arnott, along with a locket of his hair, a pair of duelling pistols and a handkerchief. The snuffbox was last in the possession of Alan Cunningham, a British Army officer. The pistols are in the collection of the Small Firearms Museum, Warminster, Wiltshire.\n\nDuring the night following the Emperor's death, Arnott took a death mask made from surgical wax (as no gypsum was available on the island) and inscribed it with his signature and the date 6 Mai 1821. This is now in the collection of the Musée Masséna in Nice, France.\n\nOn 3 May 1821 Napoleon gave instructions that should he become insensible, no English physician but Arnott was to touch him. Napoleon died on 5 May 1821, and Arnott attended his post-mortem examination. The Emperor bequeathed Arnott six hundred Napoleons and the British government gave him an additional payment of five hundred pounds.\n\nAfter his retirement to Ecclefechan, Arnott acquired a collection of anecdotes of the period and wrote an \"\"Account of the last illness, Decease, and Post-mortem appearances of Napoleon\"\" in 1822. After the war, Arnott returned to his native parish and his estate of Kirconnel Hall.

The libretto was written by Antoine Gautier de Montdorge (1707–1768). The work was first performed on 21 May 1739 by the Académie royale de musique at its theatre in the Palais-Royal in Paris..\n\n\"Les fêtes d'Hébé\" was Rameau's second \"opera-ballet\"; his first, \"Les Indes galantes\", had appeared in 1735. It was first performed at the Paris Opéra on 21 May 1739. The famous dancer Marie Sallé appeared as Terpsichore in the third entrée. Montdorge was a friend of Rameau's patron Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelinière. His libretto came in for heavy criticism and the second \"entrée\" had to be revised with the aid of Simon-Joseph Pellegrin, who had written the words for Rameau's first opera, \"Hippolyte et Aricie\". In spite of the weak libretto, the work was an immediate success and became one of Rameau's most popular operas, enjoying 80 performances in its first year. It was revived in 1747, 1756 and 1764 (with set designs supervised by François Boucher and the role of Iphise taken by Sophie Arnould). Thereafter, 18th century productions only gave partial versions of the work.\n\n\"Les fêtes d'Hébé\" takes the form of a typical \"opéra -ballet\": a series of self-contained acts loosely based around a theme, in this the case the \"lyric arts\" of poetry, music and dance.\n\nHebe is harassed by the unwanted attentions of Momus. Love suggests she should escape with her to the banks of the River Seine to witness festivities celebrating the arts.\n\nOn the island of Lesbos, the love of the two poets Sappho and Alcaeus is harmed by the jealous Thelemus, who persuades King Hymas to banish Alcaeus. When the king is out hunting, Sappho surprises him and stages an allegorical play for him, by which Hymas learns the truth. The king pardons Alcaeus and the lovers rejoice.\n\nIphise, daughter of Lycurgus, King of Sparta, is due to be married to Tyrtaeus, an accomplished musician as well as a warrior. An oracle announces that Iphise must marry the \"conqueror of the Messenians\" and Tyrtaeus leads his soldiers into battle against them. Iphise views the action in the form of a ballet provided by the oracle. Tyrtaeus is victorious and the act ends with general rejoicing.\n\nThe shepherdess Eglé, well known for her skill at dancing, is due to choose a husband. The god Mercury visits her village in disguise and falls in love with her, arousing the jealousy of the shepherd Eurilas. Eglé chooses Mercury and the two celebrate with the help of Terpsichore, the muse of dance, and her followers.\n\nThe music has received much praise. According to Cuthbert Girdlestone, \"Rameau gave of his best. No work of his contains more variety or contains so kaleidoscopically complete a view of his range in lyric, tragedy or pastoral.\" Graham Sadler has written, \"Rameau, by now at the height of his powers, contributes a score of astonishing inventiveness. \"C'est une musique enchantée\", wrote one contemporary with little exaggeration. This is especially true of the third entrée, wonderfully rich in that languorous and often deeply nostalgic music that is one of Rameau's hallmarks.\"\n\nRameau included orchestrated versions of several of his harpsichord pieces in the score. For example, \"L'entretien des Muses\" in the second entrée from the D major suite in the 1724 \"Pièces de Clavessin\", and the musette and tambourin from the E minor suite in the same book in the third entrée.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7730807", "categories": ["Ballets by Antoine Gautier de Montdorge", "Operas by Jean-Philippe Rameau", "1739 operas", "Operas based on Greco-Roman mythology", "Operas", "Ballets by Jean-Philippe Rameau", "French-language operas", "Opéras-ballets"], "title": "Les fêtes d'Hébé"}

Monkee #1 (Dolenz) performs an R&B up-tempo duet remake of \"I'm a Believer\" with Driscoll; Monkee #2 (Tork) reclines on a giant cushion in Eastern Garb and, to the lilting backing of sitar and tabla, performs \"I Prithee (Do Not Ask For Love),\" a gentle number concerning spiritual values. Monkee #3 (Nesmith), in an inventive blue-screen number, sings a country tune with himself, \"Naked Persimmon\"; and a toy-sized Monkee #4 (Jones) sings and dances to the tune of \"Goldilocks Sometime.\"\n\nNext, the Monkees perform \"Wind Up Man\" in the stiff-legged form of robots (dressed similar to the outfits they debuted in). Auger, criticizing their performance, introduces a four-part piano harmony in a unique piano-stacked set up with Auger and his electric keyboard on top, then descending to Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and finally Fats Domino on the bottom. Disapproving Auger's brainwashing method, Charles Darwin steps in and inexplicably switches to Paul Arnold and the Moon Express' \"Only The Fittest Shall Survive\", a psychedelic dance performance. Then the Monkees, clad in ape costumes, perform Neil Sedaka's \"I Go Ape\". With his work done, Darwin allows Auger, Driscoll, and the Trinity to work from there, while singing the Young Rascals' \"Come On Up\".\n\nWith the process complete, Auger introduces the Monkees to a gig at the Paramount Theater on December 7, 1956, and describing them as \"idolized, plasticized, psychoanalyzed, and sterilized\". The four, dressed in outlandish 1950s vocal group gear, are then immediately launched into a classic '50s rock medley: \"At The Hop,\" \"Shake A Tail Feather\" \"Little Darlin',\" \"Peppermint Twist,\" backed up by Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Fats Domino, We Three, and The Clara Ward Singers. The guest performers contributed their own songs to the medley, with the Ward Singers performing \"Dem Bones\" as the segment's finale. Peter Tork's girlfriend Reine Stewart stood in as drummer for Fats Domino when his regular drummer couldn't attend.\n\nAt the end of the medley, Auger and Driscoll break character and say that the brainwashing concept has gone out of hand and would rather see The Monkees have \"complete and total freedom\" which Driscoll describes as \"utter bloody shambles\".\n\nThe rest of the special takes place in a warehouse full of instruments and props. It begins with Davy standing atop a high staircase performing Bill Dorsey's \"String For My Kite\". Peter enters the scene next and performs, on a Hohner \"Clavinette\" harpsichord, \"Solfeggietto\" by C.P.E. Bach. Finally, Mike and Micky arrive and perform \"Listen To The Band,\" with Nesmith on Black Beauty guitar (Gibson Les Paul Custom), Tork on keyboards, Dolenz on drums, and Jones on tambourine (in what would turn out to be their final appearance as a quartet until 1986 as well as their final network television appearance as a quartet until 1996). As the song progresses, they are joined by extras (Good sent buses down to Sunset Strip to round up about 100 extras for \"a party\") and all of \"33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee\"<nowiki>'s guest musicians from The Trinity to the Buddy Miles Express resulting in a climactic frantic cacophony, similar to the crescendo in \"</nowiki>Revolution 9\"; it pans aside to a book with \"Chaos is Come Again\" on the next page. The book closes with \"The Beginning of the End\" on the back cover.\n\nThe closing credits feature a reversed scene from the Moon Express' dance sequence, with Tork singing \"California, Here I Come\" over the credits as California is nuked killing off the fictional Monkees. \n\nThe general opinion of the viewers and participants of \" Revolutions per Monkee\" claim the special to be chaotic, both on-screen and off-screen. The Monkees went into rehearsals for the program one day after their return from their Australasian tour in October 1968. Production on the program began in November 1968, after completing a press tour promoting their film, \"Head\". Music sessions with Bones Howe and Michael Nesmith producing commenced in mid-November, with the final taping of the special occurring at the end of the month. Before production started, a strike at NBC almost meant that the special could not be taped; however, stage space was found at MGM Studios in Culver City, and the sets were transported there. Because it was a last-minute change of location, the special was directed from outdoor broadcast trucks parked outside the soundstages.\n\nThe Monkees were reportedly angry with producer Jack Good and director Art Fisher's script for \" Revolutions per Monkee\", calling it \"too sloppy, too fairy-tale like,\" while Davy Jones felt that, for a TV special starring the Monkees, it emphasized rather largely the guest cast over the group itself.\n\nPeter Tork, in liner notes for \"The Monkees Anthology\" CD compilation, called \"\" \"the TV Version of \"Head\"\". Tork was, at one point, the only Monkee working on \"Head\"; but, ironically enough, it would be Tork that would buy out his Monkees contract at the end of production of \" Revolutions per Monkee\" (on December 20, 1968), reportedly suffering from exhaustion. Tork's departure reduced The Monkees to a trio, and the group would not be seen on network TV as a foursome again until 1997. After production wrapped, Tork was given a gold watch as a going-away present, with the inscription \"To Peter, from the guys down at work.\"\n\nNegotiations were originally made in early 1968 for The Monkees to star in three NBC-TV specials to air in 1969; \" Revolutions per Monkee\" was the first. Unhappy with the final edit, NBC decided to air it on the West Coast opposite The 41st Academy Awards on ABC. Further damage was done to the telecast by an engineer who accidentally presented \" Revolutions per Monkee\" out of sequence. These incidents prompted NBC to cancel plans to produce the remaining Monkees specials. Because of the technology of the time, the Hawaiian broadcast of the special was delayed for two weeks. At the time, television stations in Hawaii received network programming via film and videotape, as there were no telephone connections capable of television broadcasting; it was finally shown there on April 28. Its telecast in Great Britain occurred on Saturday, May 24 on BBC2.\n\n\nIn the 1990s, \" Revolutions per Monkee\" was released commercially by Rhino Home Video (parent company Rhino Entertainment owns the rights to The Monkees) in two different versions. The version of \" Revolutions per Monkee\" released individually in January 1997 (R3 2284) has been on file for years at The Museum of Television & Radio (now known as the Paley Center for Media) in New York City, with good sound quality, a fuzzy picture and the segments in original broadcast order.\n\nThe DVD version features two commentary tracks; one by Brian Auger and the other by Micky Dolenz, who has mixed feelings about the program.\n\nThe special was remastered for the Monkees' 50th Anniversary Blu-Ray box set, but due to licensing restrictions, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" was edited out from the medley.\n\nNo official soundtrack has been released, nor was such a soundtrack planned because of the technology of the time, wherein a singer would sing live vocals over prerecorded tracks. It has also been said that many of the songs were left at MGM when production finished. Some songs, however, have been officially released as bonus tracks on recent deluxe editions of \"Head\" and \"Instant Replay\". The versions of songs with vocals have been lifted directly from the television audio.\n\nA number of low-quality demo recordings are known to exist, including versions of \"A String for My Kite\" and \"Wind Up Man\" and unused songs \"Buttoning the Buttons\", \"I Am a Fish\", \"Lucky You\" and \"The Bus & The Crocodile\" - all performed by the same musician, probably the show's main songwriter Bill Dorsey. \"I Am a Fish\" was recorded by Tiny Tim under the title \"The Other Side\" in 1968. Tracks \"I Ain't No Miracle Worker\" and \"I Wish That I Were Dead\" (a.k.a. \"But Now I Find\") were officially-released singles by The Brogues but have been erroneously listed as demo recordings for \" Revolutions per Monkee\", as has \"My Community\", written by Roger Atkins and Carl D'Errico, which was recorded by Tiny Tim under the title \"Community\" in 1968. A vinyl bootleg, possibly recorded by placing a microphone in front of a television speaker while the program played, was produced by Zilch Records.\n", "id": "7730808", "categories": ["The Monkees", "1960s American television specials", "Music television specials", "Musical television specials", "1969 television specials"], "title": "33⅓ Revolutions per Monkee"}

The initiative involves establishing and implementing a framework for public health information systems.\n\nPHIN is designed to do the following: \n\nThe 5 Functional Areas of PHIN:\n\nPHIN attempts to provide the public health sector with continuous access to necessary health care information. Access to near real-time data attempts to improve community based interventions that are implemented as a result of terrorism or disease outbreaks.\n\nPHIN provides supports and helps improve the outcomes of various public health programs including the following:\n\n\nPHIN first received funding in 2004 through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 25% and 30% of the $849 million of funding received through the Public Health Response and Preparedness Cooperative Agreement was to be used to focus on improving public health preparedness in all 50 states, 4 metropolitan areas and 8 US territories. In 2004 the initiative of the program was to \"ensure that all public health partners have, or at least will have, access to a system or systems to accomplish established preparedness functions.\" For year 2005, additional finances will be available to states through the terrorism cooperative agreement. This agreement will support the development of current and new systems, in state health and public health departments, which will meet the PHIN standards and specifications.\n\nIn order to collect and assess information system requirements for PHIN, the CDC works with public health partners, some of which include:\n\nWith the assistance of these partners, PHIN can target the following functional areas regarding preparedness:\n\nThe approval of technical and data standards for PHIN is completed by two working groups in the CDC Information Council (CIC). The following organizations are represented on each working group by 2 members of its staff: Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By regulation the standards conform to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requirements and the Federal Health architecture.\n\nCIC also ensures that the following standards are met:\n\nIn the realm of preparedness, the PHIN has developed systems to promote early event detection. Information systems that connect health care providers to the PHIN allow for rapid reporting of cases that may lead to public health emergencies. These information systems include call reporting systems, web-based systems, and other electronic case reporting systems. The PHIN has set up technical requirements so that facilities can be equipped to participate in these rapid reporting systems. These requirements also ensure that facilities can protect patient privacy in their reports and ensure integration with outbreak management.\n\nAnother component in preparedness, the PHIN has a division of outbreak management which allows public health agencies to be adequately prepared for true outbreaks. The outbreak management system is integrated with the early event detection systems to ensure rapid, smooth awareness of outbreaks. The CDC and PHIN currently employ an Outbreak Management System software application to effectively manage data related to outbreaks.\n\nAnother component of PHIN is connecting laboratories through a set of computer communication standards called HL7. This allows specimen receipts and laboratory results to be exchanged between health organizations and agencies. This is especially useful in times of a health outbreak or other disaster.\n\nThe PHIN also works to track and support the supply of vaccinations and as well as the administration of these tasks. As part of this functionality, the PHIN allows limited supplies of vaccines and other needed drugs to be allocated properly when they are in short supply. Some vaccines and drugs will be traceable to clinics and drug administrators. PHIN also supports response administration by allowing adverse events to be monitored and quarantined populations to be monitored if necessary.\n\nPHIN has a set of Vocabulary Standards and Specifications that:\n\n", "id": "7730818", "categories": ["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "United States Department of Health and Human Services agencies"], "title": "Public Health Information Network"}

The $10,000 (US) no-limit Texas hold 'em Main Event began on July 6 and was completed on the morning of July 18. All events were held at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada by Harrah's Entertainment, which has run the annual event since its purchase from the Binion family in 2004.\n\nFor the first time players began each event with double the amount of chips as the buy-in. This means that players in the Main Event started with 20,000 chips. The blind structure has also been increased and some blind levels removed but slowed to allow for more play.\n\nIn addition to the $50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event, which was first played at the 2006 World Series of Poker, this year there were two additional H.O.R.S.E. events with lower buy-ins ($2,500 and $5,000).\n\nTom Schneider, who won two events and made one other final table, won the Player of the Year Award. Michael Binger and Chad Brown led all other players with eight money finishes.\n\nThe annual celebrity event was changed this year, as it became a pro and celeb event called \"Ante Up for Africa\", hosted by actor Don Cheadle and poker pro Annie Duke. The final two players, Dan Shak and Brandon Moran, agreed to share first place and donate all prize money to charities in Darfur.\n\nThe \"last woman standing\" of the 2007 Main Event was Maria Ho who finished in 38th place.\n\nAlso this year, KEM Plastic Playing Cards were once again used for the events, rather than Copag brand plastic playing cards, which were used during the 2005 and 2006 World Series of Poker.\n\n\nThe $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Main Event began on July 6 with the first of four separate starting days. 6,358 players entered, 2,415 fewer than in 2006. This is the first time since 1992 that the Main Event experienced a reduction in participants. As the total number of registrants for the 2007 WSOP set a record at 54,288 with a total prize pool of $159,796,918 ($59,784,954 for the Main Event), the decrease in the number of participants in the Main Event has been attributed to a recent law that limits Internet gambling. As a result of this law, Harrah's did not allow online poker websites to directly purchase Main Event seats and offer them as prizes, if the sites conducted business with US citizens. Online entries to the Main Event that were won as prizes on Internet poker sites were a substantial contributor to the dramatic growth the Main Event seen in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. The reduced field also meant a nearly one-third reduction in the Main Event's grand prize, from the record $12 million (US) in 2006 to $8.25 million.\n\nA flatter payout structure was introduced in 2007 further reducing the prize money awarded to the final table finishers. Players who busted early in the money received a larger share than they would have in 2006. The lowest payouts in 2007 were $20,320 (just over double the buyin), as compared to $14,597 in 2006. Every player who made the final table in 2006 won over 1.5 million dollars.\n\nA minor controversy arose during the main event. The colors of the chips made it very difficult to differentiate between the chip values. Pokernews.com posted the following note on its live reporting log, \"It has literally been impossible for us to count these players' stacks due to the positioning of the cameras and the incredibly similar colors of the various chip denominations.\" Pokernews also reported that the chip color has affected play, \"Because of the similarly-colored chips it took the dealer some time to count down Kluber's stack, and not long after Rahme began thinking about his response Kluber called the clock on him.\" Other players have complained that they can't count their opponents stacks and fear asking for a chip count as speaking may reveal the strength of their hand.\n\n\"NB: This list is restricted to top 30 finishers with an existing Wikipedia entry.\"\n\n\nUnder the leadership of WSOP commissioner, Jeffrey Pollack, the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion of the World Series of Poker. In September 2007, the first WSOP championship events outside of Las Vegas took place in London. It was the first time that WSOP bracelets were awarded outside of Las Vegas. Three tournaments were held, with the main event being a £10,000 buy-in no-limit hold 'em tournament.

Pointon was a left-back who is perhaps best remembered for changing the way people looked at left backs. In an interview with Shoot magazine (1994) Roberto Carlos admitted he was actually right footed as a child however after watching Pointon stroll through an FA Cup tie against Wrexham he wanted to follow in his footsteps and that one day he wished to be compared to Pointon. Carlos retired as the second best left back of all time behind Neil and still to this day can't make eye contact with Mr Pointon without feeling shame.\n\nPointon began his career at lower-league Scunthorpe United and quickly established himself as a regular first-teamer and a consistent and reliable performer in defence. In the autumn of 1985, after four years at Scunthorpe, Pointon was bought by the reigning English league champions Everton for £75,000, manager Howard Kendall hoping Pointon could provide squad cover for regular left-back Pat Van Den Hauwe. Ultimately Pointon ended up featuring in the majority of Everton's games during the remainder of the 1985/86 season as a result of Van den Hauwe moving to central defence to cover for the injured centre-back Derek Mountfield. Everton finished that season as runners-up to local rivals Liverpool in both the league championship and the FA Cup, though Pointon played no part in the FA Cup final due to Mountfield's return to fitness.\n\nIn the following season, Pointon struggled with injury and had to compete with not only Van den Hauwe but also veteran defender Paul Power, signed from Manchester City, for the left-back spot at Goodison. Pointon did however play enough games that year to qualify for a Championship winners medal as Everton won their second title in three years.\n\nOver the next couple of years Pointon was a consistent performer in the Everton defence when called up to the first team, although Kendall's departure to Athletic Bilbao and the break-up of the Championship winning side saw a decline in the club's fortunes. During 1989/90, Pointon became Everton's first choice left-back following the sale of Van den Hauwe to Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nIn the summer of 1990, Pointon left Everton to rejoin Howard Kendall at his new club Manchester City, with Kendall receiving Pointon and £300,000 in exchange for Andy Hinchcliffe. Pointon spent two years at City as a first-team regular before moving on to Joe Royle's Oldham Athletic, then a top-flight club. Pointon spent three years at Boundary Park, during which time the club were relegated from the Premiership.\n\nOn 10 April 1994, Pointon put the Latics ahead in the 106th minute (extra time) of the FA Cup semi final at Wembley Stadium against Manchester United, only for Mark Hughes to equalise one minute before the final whistle and force a replay. The replay at Maine Road saw the Latics lose 4–1, with Pointon scoring Oldham's consolation goal. \nUnited went on to win both the Premier League title and FA Cup, while Pointon and his colleagues had the double misery of an FA Cup exit and Premier League relegation in less than a month. During this period Neil made the tabloid papers following a brief liaison with television personality Dani Behr.\n\nPointon joined Scottish Premier Division outfit Heart of Midlothian in 1995, enjoying a number of seasons up in Scotland before later playing for Walsall, Chesterfield and Hednesford Town. He scored for Hednesford against former club Oldham Athletic in an FA Cup tie at Keys Park, soon before being handed the reins as Manager at Hednesford. He lasted as little as 9 games in his first Managerial post before being sacked after not winning a single game. The club later got relegated, but very few fans of the Staffordshire Club actually put the blame with him.\n\nAfter a spell as player-manager of Retford United he joined Mossley as a player and helped Mossley to win the Worthington Challenge Trophy at Gigg Lane, Bury with a 2–1 win over Clitheroe in his last ever professional game.\n\nHe currently works for Higher Lane Primary School as a sports coach.\n", "id": "7730916", "categories": ["Chesterfield F.C. players", "Walsall F.C. players", "Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players", "English Football League players", "Everton F.C. players", "1964 births", "Premier League players", "Manchester City F.C. players", "Scunthorpe United F.C. players", "English footballers", "Heart of Midlothian F.C. players", "Living people", "Bolton Wanderers F.C. non-playing staff", "People from Mansfield", "Scottish Football League players"], "title": "Neil Pointon"}

The well-to-do New York family fell on hard times when she was about ten years old, and her father left for Europe to try to recoup his fortune, leaving her mother with five children. When a well-meaning friend of Dunning's mother suggested that the girl might become a milliner's apprentice, her mother said \"That settles the question. You are going to go to college.\" Dr. Mary Corinna Putnam Jacobi, a friend of the family, recommended Cornell University's medical preparatory course, and her uncle, Henry W. Sage, a founder of Cornell, agreed to pay her tuition. Other family friends also helped with expenses. Emily Dunning graduated in 1897 and decided to attend the College of Medicine of the New York Infirmary. During her sophomore year there, the college merged with the new Cornell University School of Medicine.\n\nShe earned her medical degree in 1901, then received the second highest grade in the qualifying exam for an internship at Gouverneur Hospital in New York City. The hospital denied her application. The next year she applied again, this time with the support from political and religious figures, and the hospital accepted her—the first woman ever accepted for post-graduate surgical training in service to a hospital.\n\n\"Barringer's fellow medical residents assigned her difficult 'on call' schedules and ward duties, and harassed her in other ways,\" according to the Web site of the National Medical Library. She wrote about the harassment in her autobiography, which \"illustrates the value of support from mentors, family, friends, nursing staff, and the public.\" A woman doctor was a curiosity for the Lower East Side neighborhood where she worked, and New York City newspapers published feature articles about her.\n\nShe married Benjamin Barringer, also a physician, the day after she finished her residency in 1904. The couple had two children, Benjamin Lang Barringer (1910-1992) and Velona Barringer Steever (1918-1989).\n\nDuring World War I she served as vice chair of the American Women's Hospitals War Service Committee of the National Medical Women's Association (later the American Medical Women's Association) and led a campaign to raise money for\nambulances to be sent to Europe.\n\nAfter the war, Barringer took a post on the gynecological staff at New York Polyclinic Hospital. She was also an attending surgeon at the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, specializing in the study of venereal disease.\nShe also became an attending surgeon at Kingston Avenue Hospital in Brooklyn and later its director of gynecology.\n\nBarringer was an advocate of women's suffrage and worked to improve medical education for women, public health, and reforms for the treatment of imprisoned women. She was President of the American Medical Women's Association in 1942. As Co-chair of the association's War Service Committee, she organized the American Women's Hospital in Europe, which provided medical and surgical care during and after the war.\n\nDuring World War II, Barringer lobbied Congress to allow women doctors to serve as commissioned officers in the Army Medical Reserve Corps. Congress passed the Sparkman Act in 1943, which granted women the right to receive commissions in the Army, Navy, and Public Health Service.\n\nShe later lived in Darien and New Canaan, Connecticut. She was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nHer autobiography, \"Bowery to Bellevue: The Story of New York's First Woman Ambulance Surgeon\", was made into a 1952 film, \"The Girl in White\", by MGM.\n\n", "id": "7730970", "categories": ["People from Scarsdale, New York", "Women surgeons", "People from Darien, Connecticut", "1961 deaths", "1876 births", "American women's rights activists", "20th-century American physicians", "Weill Cornell Medical College alumni"], "title": "Emily Barringer"}

Instruments created centuries ago by Landolfi and his fellow Italian luthiers have not been improved upon despite modern technology and are still played by the finest violinists and violists in the great concert halls across the world.\n\nLandolfi was born in Milan, Italy in 1714 and after an apprenticeship in Cremona, Italy, he returned to Milan in 1734, age 20, and created his workshop.

For example, Landolfi developed an approach that increased the arching of the belly of each violin and viola with relation to the back. And his careful workmanship included scroll carving of a particularly graceful manner, often smaller and broader than the work of other master luthiers.\n\nImportantly, Landolfi's most exceptional instruments possess a full tone of great carrying power. For that reason, over the centuries Landolfis have been prized by solo performers.\n\nMusicians who have owned Landolfis include Carl Flesch, the Hungarian violinist and teacher (1873 - 1944) who played both a Landolfi and the Brancaccio Stradivarius.\n\nCarnegie Library, Pittsburgh, PA\n", "id": "7730996", "categories": ["1714 births", "Italian musical instrument makers", "1784 deaths", "Luthiers"], "title": "Carlo Ferdinando Landolfi"}

The plot concerns the conflict between a wealthy couple and a poor laborer after a worldwide terrorist attack isolates them in a small remote ranch. \"9/Tenths\" was filmed outside of Los Angeles, CA in Canyon Country. Its world premiere was at the 2006 Sedona International Film Festival on February 24, 2006.\n\nThe film takes place sometime in the not too distant future where terrorist attacks are on the rise and cities are the primary targets. Jessica (Gabrielle Anwar) and husband William (Henry Ian Cusick) have fled the city amid the increasing terrorist threats. William is excited to relocate to his newly purchased ranch hundreds of miles from nowhere. Jessica reluctantly humors her husband and his paranoid fears by going along.\n\nOn their arrival, William and Jessica discover someone already living in their house. Elias (Dave Baez) proves quite an intimidating presence when the couple discovers him in their kitchen butchering a freshly killed animal. But Elias soon explains in his broken English that he was the caretaker for the previous owner who had promised to let him continue living there as a reward for his services.\n\nWilliam knows of no such arrangement and quickly attempts to get rid of this man he sees as nothing more than a trespasser. Elias sees the couple the same way and develops his own ideas about sending them back to the city. Meanwhile, it quickly becomes obvious that William is of little use in this rustic environment that Elias calls home. Even a simple task like fixing a broken water heater is beyond William's range of expertise. \"I pay people to do these things for me,\" he blurts out. Obviously successful in the professional world, William is at a loss in his newfound sanctuary. William's frustration festers as he observes Elias's adroitness with such tasks.\n\nJust as the property dispute escalates to a dangerous level, the three hear parts of an emergency radio broadcast indicating that an extremely large terrorist attack has caused widespread, catastrophic destruction in the world around them.\n\nThe three are cut off from everything, completely in the dark as to whether anybody at all, is left alive in the area, the country or even the world.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7731095", "text": "Ernest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n\nErnest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (German: \"Ernst August I\"; 19 April 1688 – 19 January 1748), was a duke of Saxe-Weimar and, from 1741, of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nHe was the second but eldest surviving son of Johann Ernst III, Duke of Saxe-Weimar and his first wife Sophie Auguste of Anhalt-Zerbst.\n\nWhen his father died in 1707, Ernst August became co-ruler (\"Mitherr\") of Saxe-Weimar, along with his uncle Wilhelm Ernst, but his title was only nominal, since Wilhelm Ernst was the actual ruler of the duchy. Only when Wilhelm Ernst died in 1728 did Ernst August begin to exercise true authority over Saxe-Weimar.\n\nErnst August was a splendor-loving ruler, and his extravagances contributed to the eventual financial ruin of his duchy. Desperately in need of funds, he resorted to the practice of arresting wealthy subjects without cause, and setting them free only after they had renounced their fortunes to the duke, or had paid exorbitant ransoms. Some of the victims, who considered this behaviour illegal, made claims against the duke at the Imperial Court in Vienna or in the Imperial Chamber Court of Appeal in Wetzlar. Ernst August lost all the legal proceedings mounted against him. The process lasted for many years and eventually led to the duchy's bankruptcy.\n\nThe duke maintained a standing army that was disproportionately large for the duchy's population or financial resources. Some of the soldiers were rented to the Electorate of Saxony or to the Holy Roman Emperor. Ernst August's mania for building led to the construction of the Kleinode, the small Schloss Belvedere and the Rococo Schloss of Dornburg, a lavish residence for the duke. His passion for the hunt was likewise extravagant; when he died, Ernst August left 1,100 dogs and 373 horses. The duke maintained a standing \"harem,\" in which two noble \"Ladies of Honour\" (\"Ehrenfräulein\") and three \"Chamber Women\" (\"Kammerfrauen\") of low birth attended to his desires.\n\nIn Nienburg on 24 January 1716, Ernst August married Eleonore Wilhelmine of Anhalt-Köthen, daughter of Emmanuel Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. They had eight children:\n\nAfter the death of his first wife in 1726, the duke decided to not marry again, choosing to live quietly with his Ladies of Honor and Chamber Women. But in 1732 the situation changed unexpectedly: his only surviving son, the hereditary prince (\"Erbprinz\") Johann Wilhelm, died. This made it necessary for him to find a new wife and sire sons in order to perpetuate the dynasty.\n\nIn Bayreuth on 7 April 1734, Ernst August married his second wife, Sophie Charlotte of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, daughter of George Frederick Charles, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. They had four children:\n\nThe duke also had an illegitimate son with Friederike von Marschall:\n\nIn 1741 the branch of Saxe-Eisenach-Jena became extinct with the death of Wilhelm Heinrich, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. As the only surviving kinsman of the late duke, Ernst August inherited his estates; the union between Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach-Jena now became permanent. One of the duke's few wise decisions was the institution of the \"Primogenitur\" in Saxe-Weimar (confirmed in 1724 by the Emperor Karl VI); this stopped further land divisions in the future. From 1741 his new duchy took the name of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (Jena was merged by Eisenach), but the union was by this time only personal. The new state consisted of two larger areas around the two official residences in Weimar and Eisenach, which were not connected, and a patch of smaller areas and towns between them.\n\nThe annexation of Saxe-Eisenach was favorable to the hunt-loving duke; he possessed a large swath of woods in the Eisenach region, which seemed suitable to him for hunting. He left the Hereditary Prince in Weimar in the Schloss Belvedere, under the guardianship of his Hofmarschall, and moved permanently to Eisenach. After this, the duke rarely asked for his son, and send the most unreasonable written instructions from Eisenach to Weimar in order to supervise his son's education. The Hereditary Prince saw his father for the last time in 1743.\n\nErnst August tried to implement Absolutism in Saxe-Weimar on the French model. The secret \"Ratskollegium\" —a consultative organ national formed by nobles— was dissolved. In 1746 the citizens of Eisenach presented the duke a memorandum detailing national prerogatives, in which he was denounced for constant offences against traditional rights. The gesture demonstrated that the citizens of the duchy were resisting the introduction of absolutism, thus certain policies that Ernst August had planned could not be completely carried out. The duke's death prevented a terrible controversy between the national nobles and the citizens of Eisenach.\n\nUpon his death, Ernst August left a financially ruined duchy, and a successor to the throne (Ernst August II) who was still under age.\n\n", "id": "7731095", "categories": ["House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach", "Dukes of Saxe-Eisenach", "People from Weimar", "Dukes of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach", "1688 births", "Dukes of Saxe-Weimar", "1748 deaths"], "title": "Ernest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach"}

By 1847, members of the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences moved to the Vienna Academy, however, some of the members moved to other academies. Members moving to academies other than the Vienna Academy included: Palacký, Šafařík, Zippe, Presl and Purkyně.\n\nAfter 1847 the sciences have continued to play a role in the Czech state, continuing through the creation of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts, which was created in 1890 through a decree issued by Emperor Franz Joseph, which existed among many other institutions.

The village numbers 6,181 people (census 2011) and has the largest ethnic Macedonian population in Serbia by percentage.\n\nSerbian and Macedonian place names mean apple, Hungarian name (official name Torontálalmás from 1898 to 1918) meant apple of Torontál, andGerman name (official name Apfeldorf from March 1943 to September 1944) meant apple village. A legend tells about Serbian fishermen who settled near an apple tree, and it was published in printed edition for first time in 1912. There is no deed or other written evidence of founding by first settlers.\n\nJabuka is located on flat and fertile plain nearby Tamiš river at , approximately 11 km NW of Pančevo and 27 km NE of Pančevo bridge to Belgrade.\n\nIn the 1970's, scientific staff of Archaeological Institute Belgrade carried out extensive excavations on communal area. The scientists found objects and tracks of temporary settlement of Neolithic (Vinča and Starčevo cultures), Chalcolithic (Baden culture) and Iron periods.\n\nThe communal area was part of Temeşvar Eyalet in Ottoman Empire since 1552, after the Treaty of Požarevac part of Habsburg's Banat, since 1765 of military frontier (Austrian Empire) and then it belonged to Torontál county of Austria-Hungary. After World War I was that area part of provisional Torontalsko-tamiške županja (Treaty of Trianon), in 1922 of Belgrade oblast and since 1929 of Danubian Banovina in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In time after World War II its belonged to Srez Pančevo of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The communal area of Jabuka was part of administrative region of Pančevo municipality from all these centuries to the present.\n\nIn December 1764, military commission of Viennese Hofkriegsrat registered 88 \"Rascian\" people (\"Austrian\" \"German\": Serbs) who lived in 69 more or less habitable houses, and in following years Germans settled in entire region, organized by Habsburg administration.\n\nIn 1858, parson Silvester Jablonsky wrote into fragmentary history book of Catholic parish community: \"glorious appearance of sky was visible during most of summer time\".\n\nIn 1921, population of village numbered 3,265 inhabitants, including 2,819 Germans, 348 Romanians, 73 Hungarians, 20 Serbs or Croats, 2 Slovenes, 2 Russians and 1 Englishman.\n\nKatharina Richardt (1905–1940) was young domestic worker in household of honorable Jakov Avramović family from January 1921 to October 1925 in Belgrade.\n\nOn 27 October 1927, Stephan Scharinger (Serbian: Stefan Šaringer) was found hanged in his quarter. Some villagers spread arbitrary suspicions imputed to him sexual abuse of his daughter, and further on, these people threatened and harassed Maria Šaringer (Serbian: марија Шарингер, 1907–1953, Požarevac) and Aleksandr Janković family she lived with. Young lady was subconscious danger for specific \"German villager\" and his family reputation in political matter, so on Janković family including her had to emigrate from village because of increasing discrimination. Young woman became pregnant in 1926, her illegitimate child grew up as adopted child (born on 15 January 1927) by family of Hungarian origin of name in the village.\n\nJosef Speidel became first leader of local echelon of \"Deutsche Mannschaft\" and Gheorghe Metha (Romanian-German) his deputy in 1939.\n\nIn 1944, one part of German population left from the region, together with defeated German army. The remaining Germans of the village were sent to local imprisonments which existed until 1948. After prison camps were dissolved, many of German population left Yugoslavia because of economic reasons.\n\nIn the time period after World War II the village was settled with families that originated from all parts of Yugoslavia. Most of the settlers were from Macedonia, many of them originating from Kriva Palanka Municipality. In 1948, the majority of inhabitants were Macedonians (2,806 or 63.88%).\n\nOn 9 May 1768, Joseph II wrote an impression of the structural condition of the village during his inspection of the new part of southern military frontier into his diary: \"Jabuka is worst of all villages\". At the instigation of Viennese Hofkriegsrat and after approval of the financing by Viennese Hofkammer the village was new created and built up until 1774. There is a historical plan of the new village which is kept at the Austrian National Archives. At the beginning of the 19th century, cotton was planted on a trial basis in the northern Jabuka area but it was stopped because of long-term profitability reasons. In 1808, Archduke Ludwig opened a fruit plant nursery which existed until 1873. There is an impression of the old village and the plant nursery (German \"Obstgarten Plantage\") which is recorded on the map of the Franciscan land survey from the early 19th century at the National Archives of Austria. In 1905, cadastral maps of the village were recorded which are kept at the National Archives of Hungary. In 1910, the village consisted of 675 buildings, 478 made of stones or bricks, 147 made of air dried bricks or clay with stone or brick foundation and 50 made of timber or other materials. 627 buildings had roofs made of tiles, slate or sheet metal and 48 made of thatched reeds or straw.\nFrom 1959 to 1960, the old Roman Catholic Church was demolished due to dilapidated and damp foundations. A part of the dry bricks was used for construction and renovation of new and old houses of the village. The Church was built from 1773 to 1774 in neoclassical stile and renovated gradually and partially from 1829 to 1833, and its deed, dated 14 November 1833, was sealed in a niche behind altar during consecration ceremony, and original deed of foundation stone laid was situated on the ground in front of altar. After demolition of last remains of foundation walls, both historical deeds were handed over by governmental authorities of village to Diocese of Zrenjanin and Historical Archive Pančevo. The church was dedicated to Saint Leopold and stood on the place on which the modern school extension including sports hall is now. The extension was opened in school year 1961/62.\n\nIn 1901, the small Orthodox church was built. Before completion of the church, the Orthodox residents (369 Vlachs and 13 Serbs in 1890) had to go to the churches of the competent parish communities in Sefkerin or Pančevo. The Church is dedicated to Saint Demetrius. In 2011, the construction of the big Orthodox Church started, which was mostly financed by donations. The first mass was celebrated in August 2014. The church is consecrated to Saint Elijah. The new sacral building of the village is opposite the primary school \"Gotse Delchev\" in the center of the village.\n\nIt is a place which lies behind a former dam that was built between 1928 and 1934 by French company Société de Construction des Batignolles, and is no more existing since a very long time. Stratište (Serbian Cyrillic Стратиште) means place of scaffold, and paraphrases selected area of floodplains for executions by shooting. Political prisoners of National Socialism and Communism have been killed on this location during World War II in Yugoslavia. Special commands of regional \"Deutsche Mannschaft\" and \"Banater Staatswache\" killed 277 Serbian Jews of Pantschowa from June to September 1941 and Wehrmacht about up to 3,000 Serbian Jews and Romani people (\"Zigeuner\") from October to November 1941. Total exact number of these events of Wehrmacht can no longer be determined. In report from November 1941, signed by German officer, armed positions were mentioned strikingly against alleged danger by Serbian gangs (Partisans). However, it is fact that this region was no combat area at that time. These victims, who had to dig own graves first, did not fit into ideological view of German (race hygiene and eugenics).\n\nDanube Swabian members of the regional paramilitary formation \"Deutsche Mannschaft\" killed 146 of about 2,500 prisoners from Bor after overnight stay at Svilara in Pančevo from 29 September to 30 September 1944, and 53 during the stay. The 146 prisoners were brutally caught after their panic-stricken and hopeless escape attempt. Special commands of Yugoslav Partisans killed there 36 German prisoners from Jabuka and 72 Yugoslav prisoners in October and November 1944. 34 of 36 German prisoners were young Second-rate officials of the local national socialist organization of Danube Swabians and the First-rate officials were Anton Strasser (deputy of escaped Ortsgruppenleiter) and Franz Müller. The responsible Yugoslav captain of Special commands was Svetko Rupić. In some books are higher total numbers mentioned, but in the case of the five, ten to twelve thousand victims stated, there are no cited documents published that they were national socialist victims only. There is a memorial by Nebojša Delja which has been built in 1980 and it is 4 km away from the village, .\n\nThe main occupation of the people is in agriculture, as with many other local settlements. However, many of the inhabitants also work in the factories of the neighbouring city of Pančevo. There is an industrial starch factory on the municipal area.\n\nGiven that Jabuka was mostly populated with Macedonians, much of the cultural life of the village reflects these people's cultural traditions. In 1961, the cultural center \"Kočo Racin\" was founded in the village. Every year the national holiday Ilinden is celebrated. Since 2008, the festival \"Tavče Gravče\" has been also celebrated in the village.\n\nIn 2001, local Romani people have formed the association \"Crni Biseri\" (Black Pearls). In 2007, some residents founded the cultural and artistic society \"KUD Vasil Hadžimanov\".\n\nThere is a football club named OFK Jugoslavija in the village. It was founded in 1935 and its club colors are blue and white. Since 1998, there is a handball club (Rukometni Klub) named RK Jabuka.\n\n\n", "id": "7731237", "categories": ["Populated places in South Banat District", "Populated places in Serbian Banat"], "title": "Jabuka"}

Although the style can be compared with the houses of the Mediterranean coast of Santorini, the artist often evoked the nest of the hornero, a bird typical to Uruguay, when discussing the style of construction. The building, which took 36 years to complete, has thirteen floors with staggered terraces that allow one to have optimal views of sunset on the waters of the Atlantic ocean. \n\nIt pays tribute to his son Carlos Miguel, one of the seventeen Uruguayan survivors of the crash of Uruguayan 571 Air Force Flight. The flight crashed in the Andes on October 13, 1972. \n\nVilaró received important cultural and political personalities at Casapueblo, including writer Isabel Allende ambassador Mercedes Vicente, sexologist Mariela Castro, and artist Vinicius de Moraes, among others.\n\nThe building is built of whitewashed cement and stucco. It was built in a handicraft's way, without architectural plans. It evolved with a labyrinthine layout with has no straight lines inside. It was expanded and modified from year to year as a residence of \"unpredictable forms\".\n\nToday, the Hotel Casapueblo has 20 rooms and suites and 50 apartments, hot pool, sauna, bar, and restaurant. The high season is from December to February. The apartment hotel called \"Hotel Casapueblo\" or \"Club Hotel Casapueblo\" has a restaurant called \"Las Terrazas\" (The Terraces) that follows the style of the original building.\n\nThe main dome of Casapueblo contains museum and workshop where one can see part of the work of the late painter, potter, sculptor, muralist, writer, composer and builder Carlos Páez Vilaró. It has four exhibition halls: Nicolás Guillén Room, Pablo Picasso Room, Rafael Squirm Room, José Gómez Sicre Room, projection room, the Mermaid Terrace, Hippocampus Viewpoint, \"Taberna del Rayo Verde\" (Tavern of the Green Ray) coffee shop and boutique. The museum can be visited every day from 10 to 18 hours.\n\nEvery afternoon since 1994, the Ceremony of the Sun is performed on the terraces of the museum. Minutes before sunset, the artist's voice from a recording, dedicates a poem to the sun to bid him farewell.\n\n", "id": "7731246", "categories": ["Buildings and structures in Maldonado Department", "Tourist attractions in Uruguay", "Hotels in Uruguay"], "title": "Casapueblo"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7731295", "text": "Epic of evolution\n\nIn social, cultural and religious studies, the \"epic of evolution\" is a narrative that blends religious and scientific views of cosmic, biological and sociocultural evolution in a mythological manner. According to \"Taylor's Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature\", an \"epic of evolution\" encompasses\n\"Epic of evolution\" seems to have originated from the sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson's use of the phrase \"evolutionary epic\" in 1978. Wilson was not the first to use the term but his prominence prompted its usage as the morphed phrase 'epic of evolution'. In later years, he also used the latter term.\n\nNaturalistic and liberal religious writers have picked up on Wilson's term and have used it in a number of texts. These authors however have at times used other terms to refer to the idea: \"Universe Story\" (Brian Swimme, John F. Haught), \"Great Story\" (Connie Barlow, Michael Dowd), \"Everybody's Story\" (Loyal Rue), \"New Story\" (Thomas Berry, Al Gore, Brian Swimme) and \"Cosmic Evolution\" (Eric Chaisson).\n\nEvolution generally refers to biological evolution, but here it means a process in which the whole universe is a progression of interrelated phenomena, a gradual process in which something changes into a different and usually more complex form (emergence). It should not be 'biologized' as it includes many areas of science. In addition, outside of the scientific community, the term evolution is frequently used differently from scientists' usage. Even respected dictionaries may present questionable definitions that are not scientific or only address genetic changes. Unfortunately it is common for the general public to enter into a discussion about evolution with a wrong definition in mind. This often leads to misunderstanding since scientists are viewing evolution from a different perspective. The same applies to the use of the term theory as used in the theory of evolution (see references for Evolution as theory and fact).\n\nThis epic is not a long narrative poem but a series of events that form the proper subject for a laudable kind of tale. It is mythic in that it is a story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the worldview of a people and explains a natural phenomenon. It is a form of myth that has an approach to investigation that is empirical or scientific. According to Joseph Campbell myths serve two purposes—provide meaning for a maturing individual (an individuate) and how to be part of a community. This Epic does both.\n\nDr. William Grassie of Temple University writes that the word \"myth\" in common usage is usually misunderstood. In academia it defines \"a story that serves to define the fundamental world view of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society\". He suggests that the Greek term \"mythos\" would be a better term to apply to the Epic as it is more all-encompassing. He concluded that there is not yet an interpretive tradition within science and society about this epic of evolution. If anything, there is an anti-interpretation tradition. Consequently, this is dangerous as it is a powerful revelation at this time. Grassie says the Epic is complex and multifaceted, not simple or easy to understand. It takes a romantic vision, philosophical rigor, and artistic interpretations. It requires a consilience of modern disciplines and acceptance of social diversity. The ancient wisdoms of the world's spiritual traditions must be adapted to make the framework to weave the Epic.\n\nE. O. Wilson explained that humans had a need for the epic of evolution because they must have a mythical story or a sublime account of how the world was created and how humanity became part of it. Religious epics fulfill a primal need in this respect as they verify that humans are part of something greater than themselves. The best empirical knowledge that science and history can provide is necessary in order to provide a comparable epic tale that will reliably unite a separated human spirituality. He believes the evolutionary epic can be as inherently noble as any religious epic when it is expressed in a poetic way. In a similar vein, biologist Ursula Goodenough sees the tale of natural emergence as far more magical than traditional religious miracles. It is a story that people can work with in a religious way if they elect to do so.\n\nPhilip Hefner uses the analogy of weaving to describe the Epic. The warp anchors the story and the weft creates the pattern and the tapestry. The Epic, as scientists see it, is the warp and the weft forms the pattern as each of us views it (we are all weavers) but the patterns all have the warp in common. Hefner writes that stories about the evolutionary epic are redolent with ultimacy. It is not science; it is scientifically informed myth, a myth driven by the refusal to give up on the insistence that the natural world and our lives in the world have meaning and purpose. It is a mythical tale of irony and hope that fills a large space in the domain of religion-and-science. Biologist Ursula Goodenough also makes use of Hefner's weaving metaphor.\n\nConnie Barlow and Michael Dowd's Great Story divides the epic into 8 phases eons or eras: the Great Radiance, the Galactic, Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. Dowd uses the term 'epic of evolution' to help construct his viewpoint of evolution theology (a form of theistic evolution). His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive. He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe. Evolution is viewed as a spiritual process that it is not meaningless blind chance.\n\nLoyal Rue states that there is nothing in the core of everybody's story to rule out belief in a personal deity. However belief in God is not an indispensable part of this narrative and here will be both theistic and non-theistic versions of it. He says it is the fundamental story of matter, created from energy, the organization of that matter into complex conditions, and then via self-organization into diverse life forms. Humans are as other living things—we are by nature star-born, earth-formed, fitness-maximized, biochemical systems. An aspect of the Epic is the evolution of behavior by that biochemical system.\n\nBrian Swimme sees the Epic as a way to gently maneuver a person into the magnificence of the Universe and as an antidote to the unhealthy consciousness of consumerism. It is the way into the future and enabled him to comprehend the cultural significance of this new story of science moving away from a materialistic worldview. It may move science away from its traditional abstractness to the uniqueness found in natural history. To him evolution and creativity are equivalent so it could be the Epic of Creativity (similar to Gordon Kaufman's thinking). Although the Epic is scientific, it is 'definitely mythic'—it has the fundamental nature of being mythic. \"You take hydrogen gas, and you leave it alone, and it turns into rosebuds, giraffes and humans.\"\n\nGordon D. Kaufman sees the Epic as a serendipitous creative process. He states that it is a notion that can interpret the enormous expansion and complexification of the physical universe (from the Big Bang outward), as well as the evolution of life here on earth and the gradual emergence of human historical existence. The whole vast process manifests (in varying degrees) serendipitous creativity, an everflowing coming into being of new modes of reality. In his book, \"In the beginning—creativity\", he says this creative process is God. Creativity, as metaphor, and as defined in the concept of evolution, has possibilities for constructing a new concept of God. The most foundational kind of creativity is found in that of cosmos/biological evolution—a paradigm that is now the organizing principle of all the sciences. It would seem as though he was equating God to the evolutionary story. This is similar to Dowd who sees the facts of Nature as God's native tongue.\n\nEric Chaisson orients his view of the epic around an \"arrow of time\", which he divides into 'Seven Ages of the Cosmos': particulate, galactic, stellar, planetary, chemical, biological, and cultural. However, such a thermodynamic arrow is not intended to be directional, a common misunderstanding; he sees no purpose, plan, or design in evolution, which he regards as unceasing, uncaring, and unpredictable. Chaisson’s strictly scientific analysis of evolution in its broadest sense—cosmic evolution)—implies an unidirectional, meandering process extending from the big bang to humankind on Earth, and continuing while likely producing increasing complexity, perhaps forever, to ends unknown. As a physicist, he is perhaps best known for attempting to quantify the epic of evolution, using the currently known laws of science and the scientific method (with its insistence on experimental tests of all ideas, principally those of energy rate density) in order to empirically discriminate between objective sense and subjective nonsense. What emerges is a grand and inspiring \"scientific\" narrative of who we are and whence we came—the most recent and up-to-date version of this work having been summarized in a long peer-review article.\n\nBron Taylor's \"Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature\" gives four primary categories: cosmic, planetary, life, cultural.\n\nThe creation-evolution controversy goes beyond the field of evolutionary biology and includes many fields of science (cosmology, geology, paleontology, thermodynamics, physics and sociobiology).\n\nAlthough in the scientific community there is essentially universal agreement that the evidence of evolution is overwhelming, and the consensus supporting the neo-Darwinian evolutionary synthesis is nearly absolute, creationists have asserted that there is a significant scientific controversy and disagreement over the validity of the evolution epic.\n\nThe debate is sometimes portrayed as being between science and religion. However, as the National Academy of Sciences states:\n\nDr.John Haught, Roman Catholic theologian, in his \"Science and Religion: from Conflict to Conversation\" suggests a theistic acceptance of the Epic. He says contemporary theology is being changed by evolutionary science. There are many versions undergoing constant revision. He considers evolution to be, at least provisionally, a most appropriate and fruitful scientific framework within which to think about God today and deplores that contemporary theology gets hung up in the creationism controversy. There are liberal congregations these days that may see the epic of evolution as a history about life and the universe that is both scientific and sacred. The profoundly sacred elements of the story warm up the cold technical facts with awe and reverence, giving Nature an inspiring beauty.\n\nEric Chaisson, in his book, \"Epic of Evolution\", concludes that the coherent story of cosmic evolution—a powerful and noble effort—may perhaps be the way to ethical evolution in the new millennium. Although his is a decidedly materialistic view of the evolutionary epic, he recognizes more than most scientists that humanity is part of this grand story and that we have a responsibility to survive as the only sentient, intelligent beings known in the universe.\n\nNot all of the Epic's advocates are distinguished scientists. Some are Christians who consider it a 'narrative of mythic proportions' that contain religious aspects. They see it as a multifaceted concept that has been in Christian theology implicitly for hundreds of years and is congenial to perspectives that include ultimacy, transcendence, purpose and morality. However, there are both humanists and creationists who dispute this stance, making unclear the many varied theological stories of our world.\n\nIn 1996 the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science held a conference on the epic of evolution. In 1997 the American Association for the Advancement of Science organized a conference on the epic of evolution as part of their program on Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion. In July 1999, The Forum on Religion and Ecology with special support from the Center for Respect of Life and Environment sponsored a conference titled The Epic of Evolution and World Religions. It consisted of a small invitational gathering of scholars of the world's religious traditions as well as a number of scientists and educators. It explored how the creation stories of the world's religions intersect with or react to the epic of evolution. An Evolutionary Epic conference was held in Hawaii in January 2008. It was attended by scientists, artists, educators, and spiritual and religious leaders. \n\nWashington University in St. Louis offers a course on the epic of evolution. The Epic has also been taught at Northern Arizona University. The course engaged the task of formulating a new epic myth that is based on the physical, natural, social, and cultural sciences for which there are as yet few textbooks. The course was presented in three segments: the cosmos before humans appeared, the human phenomenon, and scenarios for the future of evolution. An annual undergraduate course on \"cosmic evolution\" has been taught at Harvard University for most of the past 35 years.\n\nEvolution Sunday, a Christian church event (1,044 Congregations observed it in 2009) arose from the Clergy Letter Project signed in 2004 by 10,500 American clergy. It is spreading internationally and across other faiths. It supports the story of evolution in a manner similar to the Epic (science and religion compatibility) promoting serious discussion and reflection on the relationship between religion and science. \"For far too long, strident voices, in the name of Christianity, have been claiming that people must choose between religion and modern science,\" says Michael Zimmerman, founder of Evolution Sunday and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Butler University in Indianapolis. \"We're saying you can have your faith, and you can also have science.\"\n\nMichael Dowd and his wife Connie Barlow have traveled the US since 2002 by van as nomads teaching his \"Gospel of Evolution\".\n\n\nReading lists – Books of the Epic of Evolution,\nCosmic Evolution\n\n", "id": "7731295", "categories": ["Evolution and religion", "Biological evolution"], "title": "Epic of evolution"}

Somayajulu in the main roles. The film was directed by A. Kodandarami Reddy and produced by Allu Aravind. This film released on 23 October 1985. Chiranjeevi won his second Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in the film.\n\nThe movie is a remake of the Hindi movie \"Saaheb\", starring Anil Kapoor and Amrita Singh, which is a remake of the Bengali film of the same name. The film was dubbed in Tamil as \"Dharma Prabhu\".\n\nMadhusudhana Rao, aka Ravi (Chiranjeevi) is a wannabe football player, who would like to represent his country. Chinnababu is also the youngest son of Narasimham (J. V. Somayajulu). Chinnababu is in love with his childhood friend and neighbour Priyadarshani (Bhanupriya). Despite his father's efforts to stop him, Chinnababu's love towards football grows and his coach encourages him to participate in leagues. Priyadarshani supports him in all his endeavours. Chinnababu's younger sister's marriage gets fixed and they are unable to arrange enough money for the marriage. Narasimham asks his sons to contribute. But, his sons, who are controlled by their wives deny any help. Frustrated, Narasimham tries to sell his house. But, Chinnababu stops him in the last moment and sends him money, saying that his elder sister sent it. His sister's marriage is done uninterrupted, without Chinnababu's presence. After marriage, his elder sister arrives and denies that she sent any money. Surprised and shocked, Chinnababu's family later learns that Chinnababu donated one of his kidneys to save a rich man's heir and sent that money. Narasimham appreciates his son's efforts, for not even bothering about his football career and saving his house on time.\n\n\nMost of the outdoor scenes were shot in Mumbai, where \"Saheeb\" was shot. Mukesh Udeshi helped the team a lot in the Mumbai shooting. Rohini dubbed Bhanupriya's voice in the film. Sreelakshmi, who played the wife of Giribabu, also had her voice dubbed by someone else for the film. K. Dattu, who worked for camera in this film as an assistant, worked for films like \"Shankar Dada MBBS\" later. Both Allu brothers, Bunny and Bobby, acted in the film. Allu Venkatesh appeared as Nutan Prasad's son and has a couple of dialogues. Allu Arjun, a two-year-old boy at that time, appears in two scenes as Subha's son.\n\nLots of discussions went into zeroing in on a title for the movie. Chinnababu was considered earlier, as both Bengali and Hindi versions had the male lead character's name as the title. There was also an advertisement in the popular film magazine \"Jyothichitra\" asking for title suggestions, and Vijetha won the majority votes. A lucky draw of those voter names was held and the winners' names were credited in the film too.\n\n", "id": "7731316", "categories": ["1985 films", "Films scored by K.

It is part of the Lincoln Village subdivision and is colloquially known as Lincoln Village. It is bounded by West Broad Street on the north, Sullivant Avenue on the south, South Grener Avenue on the east, and Redmond and Hiler Roads on the west. It is in Prairie Township, and the ZIP Code 43228.\n\nLincoln Village was built in the late 1950s as part of a new neighborhood concept in which suburbs were built near factories and would include local schools and strip malls of stores which would support the families. It was written up in a major article in \"Life Magazine\" about 1960 as the wave of the future. Lincoln Village was built near the Columbus factories for Westinghouse and General Motors. The model homes for Lincoln Village were the first few homes on the west side of Redmond Road. The development is newer than the homes on roads to its west from Woodlawn Avenue to New Rome and from South Grener Avenue to I-270. Another highlight of the neighborhood was the well-known Lincoln Lodge Motel which included a golf course which was at the northwest corner of North Murray Hill Road and West Broad Street.\n\nThe general area is home to several older buildings, and contains apartment complexes and stores. Popular stores in or near the neighborhood are KFC, CVS, and the Home Depot. Lincoln Village South is home to Stiles Elementary School. Stiles is home to children from Lincoln Park, Murray Hill, and Cherry Creek. The school has been criticized recently because it was found that during the 2005–2006 school year, 31% of the children at Stiles could not speak English. Stiles is 26% Hispanic, 25% African-American, 44% White, and 5% mixed races. This is a huge change from the all white WASP neighborhood it was in the 1960s. Stiles has played a large role in the history and story of the neighborhood.\n\nLike most West Columbus neighborhoods, Murray Hill has problems with crime. It receives policing from the Columbus Division of Police Precinct 10, Franklin Township Police Department, and the Franklin County Sheriff's Department.

They find inspiration following the same spiritual path taken by many saints, blesseds, and other holy men and women throughout the 800-year history of the Dominican Order. The Life of a Dominican layperson is all about having a passion for the Word of God. It is about committing one self to a community of like minded brothers and sisters that immerse themselves in the Word of God. There are Lay Dominican Provinces all around the world.\n\nThis was one of the earliest developments of the ancient \"Ordo de Poenitentia\" (Order of Penance). This was a status which developed in the ancient Church, in which those faithful who sought a more dedicated way of life embraced the lifestyle of a penitent then in effect in the Church. It was not the organization from which the Friars Preachers evolved, but rather represents that portion of the Order of Penance which came under Dominican influence. At first vaguely constituted and living without system or form, its members gradually grew more and more dependent on their spiritual guides.\n\nFriar Munio of Zamora, the seventh Master General of the Friars Preachers, formulated a definite Rule for these lay penitents in 1285. By this the Ordo de Poenitentia was to be ruled in each local center by a Dominican priest and was to be subject to the obedience of the Dominican priors provincial and Masters General. Henceforward this branch was linked to the fortunes of the Friars Preachers and wore their habits of black and white (with few minor differences varying according to time and country). They were not specifically called a third order until after papal recognition in 1405. but continued to be known as the \"Brothers and Sisters of Penance of St. Dominic\".\n\nA military order, called the Militia Jesu Christi (soldiery of Jesus Christ), also became a part of the third order. It owed its origin to Bishop Foulques of Toulouse, Simon de Montfort, and probably to St. Dominic, then a canon regular. This connection with the founder of the Friars Preachers is first discussed in documents relating to the Blessed Raymund of Capua, who became a Dominican about 1350. As early as 1235, Pope Gregory IX confided the Militia to the care of Friar Jordan of Saxony, second Master General, by a Bull of 18 May; and in the same year he decreed a habit of black and white for the knights. Further, when the Militia was brought across the Alps and established in Italy, it is found to be always connected with some Dominican church. Lastly, it was very largely influenced by a famous Dominican, Friar Bartolomeo of Braganza, or of Vicenza, as he is sometimes called.\n\nOriginally working side by side and independent of each other, because both received the same spiritual administration of the Friars Preachers, they appear to have been merged at the close of the 13th century. So too their ultimate merging is hinted at by Honorius III in 1221 when he designates the Militia \"nomine poenitentiae\", and a comparison also of the rules of the two institutions: that of Pope Gregory for the Militia in 1235 and that of Munio de Zamora for the Order of Penance of St. Dominic in 1285 would lead one to the same conclusion. The only considerable difference that could be cited against this identify is that Munio of Zamora expressly forbids the carrying of arms. But this is in reality but a further proof of their approximation, for he allows for the one exception which could possibly apply to the Militia, viz. in defence of the Church. This amalgamation is admitted by the Bollandists to have become general in the 14th century.\n\nFrom this double movement therefore, i.e. from the Ordo de Poenitentia S. Dominici and the Militia Jesu Christi, was born the modern Third Order of St. Dominic. Though its source is therefore anterior to the First Order, its full perfection as an organized society, with a distinctive habit, a definite rule, and a declared ethos or spirit, is due to the genius of the children of St. Dominic. They took an ancient institution, and, with their characteristic love of order and systematic arrangement, brought it into something compact and symmetrical. From them this idea of subjection to a First Order was taken up by the Franciscans and has been adopted by all subsequent Third Orders\n\nOnly for one period in its history was there any real fear of suppression. Many held that the condemnation passed on the Beguines and Beghards at the Council of Vienna in 1312 applied no less to the Orders of Penance. In consequence the master-general petitioned Pope John XXII in 1326 to settle definitely the difficulty. As a result, he answered by a Bull of 1 June 1326 (Cum de Mulieribus), which is a long eulogium on the work of the Dominican Third Order.\n\nAfter the plague of 1348, a great deal of laxity and disorganization crept into the Third Order, but a wonderful throng of saints soon caused its rejuvenation. The influence of St. Catherine of Siena gave a powerful impetus to the movement in Italy and her work was carried on by Bl. Clara Gambacorta (died 1419) and Bl. Maria Mancini (died 1431). This new spiritual vigour reached across the Alps to the sisterhoods of Germany, where the effect was almost abnormal (Heimbucher, \"Die Orden und Kongregationen der katholischen Kirche\", Paderborn, 1907, II, 169-177). But there has never been any reform in the sense of a separate organization with a change of rule or habit. As in the First Order, there has been a peculiar gift of unity which has enabled it to last undivided for seven hundred years.\n\nThe work of the Third Order is to engage laypeople to help in reform of church discipline. Its initial purpose was the preaching of penance; but under Dominican influences it leaned to the intellectual aspect of the Faith and based its message to the world on the exposition of the Creed; it was to reform Church discipline by the more widespread knowledge of the mysteries of faith. It also helped to defend the Church, and to develop the communion of prayer. The medieval ideal of Christ's Mystical Body which has captivated all spiritual-minded people implies a harmony of prayer. To achieve this end the contemplative and monastic orders were begun; and the Third Order of St. Dominic endeavours to link pious souls to this great throng of religious (Proctor, \"The Dominican Tertiary's Daily Manual\", London, 1900, 15-20).\n\nThe Third Order as it exists to-day can be divided into two categories: regular, i.e. comprising Tertiaries, whether men or women, who live in community and wear the habit externally; and secular, i.e. whether married or single, cleric or lay, who live their lives like others of their profession, but who privately take up practices of austerity, recite some liturgical Office, and wear some symbol of the Dominican habit.\n\nThe origin of the conventual women Tertiaries has never been very clearly worked out. It is usual to trace them back to Emily Bicchieri, about the year 1255. But if the view taken above of the origin of the Third Order in the Ordo de Poenitentia be correct, we are forced to the conclusion that the communities of women established by St. Dominic at Prouille, S. Sisto, etc. were really of this Third Order. Their constitutions, approved first for S. Sisto, though previously observed at Prouille, expressly speak of the nuns as \"de Poenitentia S. Mariae Magdalenae\". It would seem then that the Ordo de Poenitentia did not exclude convents of enclosed nuns from its ranks, and this was due probably to St. Dominic himself.\n\nVery much later came a conventual order of men, originated by the genius of Père Lacordaire. He considered that the democratic spirit of the Dominican Order fitted it especially for the task of training the youth. But he knew how impossible it was for his preaching associates to tie themselves down to schoolwork among boys; as a consequence, he began, in 1852, a Third Order of men, wearing the habit, living in community yet without the burdens of monastic life. The rule was approved provisionally in 1853 and definitely in 1868.\n\nBut by far the greatest portion of the Third Order consists of secular Tertiaries. These are of every rank of society, and represent the old Ordo de Poenitentia and the old Militia. In certain countries they are grouped into chapters, having a lay prior and sub-prior or prioress and sub-prioress, and hold monthly meetings. Since the Rule of Muñon de Zamora (1285), they have always been subject to a Dominican priest appointed by the Dominican provincial. For the actual reception of the habit, the master-general can give faculties to any priest. The full habit is the same as that of the members of the First and Second Orders, but without the scapular (granted, however, to communities since 1667). Though the habit is not worn during life many procure it so that they may be buried in the recognized dress of St. Dominic's children.\n\nIt is practically impossible to obtain, even in a vague way, the number of the secular Dominican Tertiaries. No general register is kept, and the records of each priory would have to be searched. From the time of St. Louis — who wished to join the Dominican and Franciscan Orders (\"Acta Sanctorum\", August, V, 545), and is represented in old illuminations, sometimes in the habit of one, sometimes in the habit of the other (Chapotin, \"Histoire de dominicains de la province de France\", Rouen, 1898, p. 497), but probably never joined either— to our own time, it can be stated only that with the rise and fall of the First Order's greatness rose and fell the number of the Tertiaries. In England during the 13th century very many are said to have become Tertiaries. But of this nothing for certain can be specified.\n\nAt the time of St. Catherine of Siena, the Mantellate (women secular Tertiaries) made difficulties about receiving her to the habit as they included at the date only widows (Gardner, \"St. Catherine of Siena\", London, 1907, II), and there were no men at all in the Third Order in Italy at that date (\"Acta Sanctorum\", April, III, 1881). Under Bl. Raymond of Capua, her confessor and, after her death, twenty-third master general, attempts were made to re-establish the order and no doubt much was done (Mortier, \"Maîtres généraux\", III, 605-606). But by the time of St. Antoninus (died 1450) the numbers had again dwindled down to insignificance (\"Summa Moralis\", Verona, 1750, III, 23, 5, 5, pp. 1291–2). Just previous to the Reformation there are a few isolated notices; thus Bl. Adrian Fortescue, the martyr, notes in his diary: \"Given to the Black Friars of Oxford to be in their fraternity 12d\" (\"Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII\", London, 1883, Rolls Series, VII, 101). But these give us no ground at all for any surmise as to statistics. In the Americas, the first canonized saint (St. Rose of Lima, died 1617) and the first beatified person of mixed-race (St. Martin de Porres, died 1639) were both Dominican Tertiaries, and later in France were men like M. Olier and St. Louis de Montfort.\n\nIn the United States, Lay Dominican Provinces include the Southern Province, Central Province, Western Province, and Eastern Province.\n\nThen came the influence of Lacordaire, from whose time there dates a new enthusiasm in the Third Order (\"Année Dominicaine\", Paris, 1910, 149-65). Of the regular Tertiaries it is easier to speak more definitely. The numbers of all the sixteen approved congregations existing in 1902 are given, and they amount to some 7000 nuns (\"Analecta Ord. Praed.\", Rome, 1902, 389). To these must be added another 7000 of congregations not yet definitively authorized by Rome. But many fresh convents were opened and the numbers continually increased. In England they began under Mother Margaret Hallahan (died 1868) in 1842, and now in all the separate groupings there are 22 convents with some 500 sisters; in the United States their success has been remarkable. Founded in 1846 by Mother Amalie Barth (died 1895), the congregation in 1902 included 34 convents and over 2000 nuns. In 1876 they passed into California, where they are rapidly increasing. In Ireland they have many establishments, especially for educational purposes, for their work is as varied as the needs of humanity require. Some are enclosed, others teach, visit the sick, nurse the lepers, look after old people, take care of penitent girls, work among the poor in the slums, etc. As for the congregation of teaching men, they have been greatly disorganized since their expulsion from France. At present they comprise but a half-dozen colleges in Fribourg, San Sebastian, and South America, and do not amount to more than 100 members in all. Finally, a citation from Faber's \"Blessed Sacrament\" (2nd ed., p. 565) may be made: \"Those who are conversant with, indeed who find the strength and consolation of their lives in, the Acts of the Saints well know that there is not a nook in the mystical Paradise of our heavenly spouse where the flowers grow thicker or smell more fragrantly than this order of multitudinous child-like saints. Nowhere in the Church does the Incarnate Word show His delight at being with the children of men in more touching simplicity, with more unearthly sweetness, or more spouse-like familiarity than in this, the youngest family of S. Dominic.\"\n\n\n\n", "id": "7731402", "categories": [], "title": "Third Order of Saint Dominic"}

His surviving works comprise the fourth volume of Ottaviano Petrucci's influential series of lute music publications, \"Intabolatura de lauto libro quarto\" (Venice, 1508). Dalza is referred to as \"milanese\" in the preface, so it must be assumed he was either born in Milan, or worked there, or both.\n\nTogether with the oeuvres of Francesco Spinacino and Vincenzo Capirola, Dalza's work constitutes an important part of early Renaissance lute music. The surviving pieces comprise 42 dances, nine ricercares, five tastar de corde, four intabulations and a piece called \"Caldibi castigliano\". The dances are arranged in miniature suites. Each of the five pavanes (five \"alla venetiana\", four \"alla ferrarese\") is followed by a saltarello and a piva that are thematically and harmonically related to it. Other groupings include pairs of \"tastar de corde\" with a \"recercar dietro\". Some pieces, such as \"Caldibi castigliano\" and those titled \"Calate ala spagnola\", show Spanish influence, possibly because of vihuela cultivation in 16th century Italy.\n\nDalza's music is, for the most part, comparatively simple and easy to perform. The composer himself acknowledged the fact in the preface to Petrucci's volume, and promised to publish more complex pieces at a later date. It is currently unknown whether this had been realized. Although contemporaries such as Spinacino and Capirola wrote in a more advanced idiom, Dalza's output is important because it consists almost entirely of original music, not vocal intabulations. Furthermore, Dalza's collection includes the earliest known pavanes (described as \"padoane diverse\" on the title page), which are also the earliest known variations: all \"pavane alla venetiana\" feature harmonic variations with a loosely defined tonic, and \"pavane alla ferrarese\" consist of series of open-ended phrases followed by varied repeats: AA'–BB'–CC'–.. etc. These variation forms are sometimes referred to as single-strain and multiple-strain, respectively.\n\nDalza's collection is also one of the very few sources to feature tastar de corde, short introductory preludes. The name translates from Italian to \"testing of the strings\". Dalza's pieces are arranged symmetrically by key: G, C, D (with F), C (with E), G. They range from 16 (number 1) to 42 bars (numbers 3 and 4); the material essentially consists of static chords alternating with short fast passages.\n\n\n", "id": "7731644", "categories": ["Italian composers", "Italian male composers", "Italian lutenists", "Composers for lute"], "title": "Joan Ambrosio Dalza"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7731750", "text": "Naomi Striemer\n\nNaomi Striemer (born October 6, 1982) is a Canadian-American singer. Raised in a conservative Christian home, she sang from the time she was a young child. Following early success with secular, she has turned her attention to Christian song-writing and singing.\n\nShe was raised on a hobby farm in Malagash Point, near Truro, Nova Scotia and homeschooled by strict missionary parents. At age ten, her family moved to Manitoba where in 1993 the 11-year-old recorded an album of Christian music. Before that point, she had never watched television nor listened to the radio. In 1998 her family moved again, this time to Florida.\n\nIn an article in Billboard that ran in February 2007, Striemer told writer Chuck Taylor that her parents \"were artistic people, hippies going the opposite way to vegetarian farmland. They did a total 360. I was completely unaware of their previous world, and a trusting child who wasn’t particularly curious. We would play tapes in the car, either classical music or folk bible songs and sermons; that was the only world I knew.”\n\nIn a November 21, 2006 interview on CBC Radio's \"Sounds Like Canada\", Striemer revealed that she is very protective of her voice. Her diet excludes caffeine, fizzy drinks and very hot / cold items. Concerning her childhood, she reflected on the close ties she had with nature and animals on the farm. While still 5 or 6 she sang with adults in a group. She further stated that she basically knew from an early age she wanted to sing professionally.\n\nIn April 2001, Striemer was signed by Epic Records and completed her first album for them in 2003 which was never released following a shakeup at Epic's parent, Sony BMG. The following year she and her family moved to the rural community of Delhi, Ontario. Conflicted over Epic's shelving of her album, she nonetheless continued performing in the Toronto area where she met her next manager, following a performance at an Indigo Bookstore. Steven Nowack subsequently founded S Records to launch Striemer's career and she was the first artist signed to S Records.\n\nStriemer moved to Los Angeles in 2005. S Records solicited the participation of producer Narada Michael Walden, who has the most number one hits of any producer in history, responsible for writing and producing many of the signature hit songs for Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.\n\nFollowing a chance meeting with Carlos Santana at a Marin, County, California steakhouse Santana recorded on Striemer's first cd \"Images\" on the first single titled \"Cars\" \"Images\" was released on December 19, 2006 in Canada on the S Records label and was the No. 1 downloaded album in Canada. \"Cars\" was released as a single and in his review, \"Billboard's\" Taylor described it as \"the year's most promising melodic debut... A standing ovation of an endorsement... Remember the first time you heard Whitney, Mariah or Celine and recognized a star was born?\"\n\nProminent press about Striemer, in addition to the CBC interview, includes the lead story on the CTV National News the most watched and most prominent nightly newscast in Canada, a front page and a feature story in Canada’s national newspaper “National Post,” features on the CTV national news and “Entertainment Tonight,” a lifestyle front in Canada’s “Globe and Mail,” and multiple items in Roger Friedman’s Foxnews.com “Foxlife” column.\n\nIn December 2006, S Records offered \"Cars\" as a free download on Internet site sympatico.msn.ca. The move thrust \"Images\" to become the No. 1 downloaded album in Canada for the final two weeks of the year, topping discs by Sarah McLachlan, U2 and the Beatles. She repeated the achievement the week of January 15, 2007—after the free download had expired—beating fare from Justin Timberlake, Josh Groban and Gwen Stefani.\n\nIn a subsequent profile in Billboard, producer Narada Michael Walden told Taylor, \"Steven [Nowack] is very zealous, so I listened to what he had to say, not taking his pitch overly seriously until I met Naomi and heard her live. I was impressed with her beauty, but more so by her voice. You believe her. She has the chops, the range, the drive—and the humility—to offer a beautiful gift.\"\n\nTaylor's description of Striemer's \"Images\" the album include the haunting piano-driven title track, which opens with the lyric, \"I found out today my love has found another/And all the things I did to make you happy won’t make you happy anymore,\" as Striemer pleads amid urgent percussion, \"If I could fight my way back to you/It would only throw me further away.\"\n\n\"Fall Behind\" is Striemer's intense take on her lost contract at Epic. She sings, \"What's happening/I feel the world slipping apart before my eyes,\" amid an inflamed backdrop of electric guitars and howling vocal of defiance.\n\nShimmering power ballad and first single \"Cars\" uses the lyrical allegory of counting passing vehicles as she waits for her AWOL man—an allusion to universal diligence in the search for love: \"In life, we wait for that one person that is meant for us,\" Striemer explains. \"They may be with someone else now, but you hold out hope that they exist, so you put on a brave face and wait\".\n\nOn August 19, 2009, Striemer's \"The Green Album\" shot to No. 2 on Canada's Puretracks album download charts after the release on August 18, 2009. It went to No. 1 on the same chart August 20, 2009.\n\nIn June 2010, Striemer made her debut on the CT20 Christian Radio Charts in Canada debuting at No. 18, moving up a spot to No. 17 the following week and up to No. 11 on June 26, 2010, where she held steady for two weeks with her single \"Perfect (When I Grow Up)\" co-written with songwriter Peter Zizzo.\n\n2012 Striemer released \"Hope That Breaks the Dark\" with singles produced by Ed and Scott Cash at Anchor Productions (Chris Tomlin, Kari Jobe, Chris August) in Nashville, TN. The first single 'Earth & Sky' spent 16 weeks in 2013 on the TRAA Charts in Australia and New Zealand and garnered a Top 5 CCM hit in Canada. The song was performed live on Christian Television programs 'The 700 Club' on CBN and 'Hour of Power' which is broadcast to dozens of countries around the world. The second single 'Giving It To God' was performed on Hour of Power and several other talk shows and remained on the Canadian Christian Contemporary charts for several weeks. Striemer became a published author releasing her autobiographical book 'Backstage Pass - The Naomi Striemer Story' in 2013 which became a Best-Seller on Amazon. The book chronicles Naomi's journey through pop music into Christian Contemporary and takes a close look at the moment that changed her life: When a man approached her in a New York City Hip Hop Studio with a dream.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7731750", "categories": ["1982 births", "Musicians from Nova Scotia", "Singers from New York (state)", "American Seventh-day Adventists", "Canadian Seventh-day Adventists", "American female singers", "People from Colchester County, Nova Scotia", "Living people", "21st-century Canadian singers", "21st-century American singers", "Canadian female singers"], "title": "Naomi Striemer"}

Maria José de Lima Campos. He began his studies at the state capital, continued in Cachoeira do Campo, where the Portuguese teacher, a priest predicted: \"You will still be a writer,\" and ended them in São João del Rei. He began the study of dentistry, veterinary medicine and law, but did not complete them. His dream of being an aviator did not materialize either. He had a diploma, he liked to joke, only in touch-typing. Still very young, he entered literary life as a member of the Minas Gerais' \"Generation of 1945\", together with such writers as Fernando Sabino, Otto Lara Resende, Hélio Pellegrino, João Ettiene Filho, Carlos Castello Branco and Murilo Rubião. In Belo Horizonte, Campos directed the literary supplement of \"Folha de Minas\" and worked in his uncle's construction company. He went to Rio de Janeiro in 1945 in order to meet the poet Pablo Neruda, and ended up staying. In Rio were already his best friends from Minas—Sabino, Otto, and Hélio Pellegrino. He began to work for the newspapers \"O Jornal\", \"Correio da Manhã\" (on which he was editor for two and a half years) and \"Diário Carioca\". In the latter, he signed the Suplemento Literário (Literary Section) and then the daily \"crônica\" Primeiro Plano. He was, for many years, one of three effective \"cronistas\" of the magazine \"Manchete\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7731766", "text": "1999–2002 FARC–Government peace process\n\nThe FARC-Government peace process (1999–2002) (), from January 7, 1999, to February 20, 2002, was a failed peace process between the Government of President Andrés Pastrana Arango and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group in an effort to bring to an end the ongoing Colombian armed conflict.\n\nThe FARC began their rebel activities in the early 1960s during the National Front years in which bipartisan hegemony controlled and held political power. In an effort to exterminate the armed guerrilla movements the Colombian government aided by the United States launched an attack to destroy the \"Marquetalia Republic\" a guerrilla enclave in central Colombia. After this attack the FARC guerrilla retreated to isolated or poor government presence areas and began establishing a parallel state governed by them. The guerrillas began extorting and kidnapping landowners and assaulting local agrarian banks (\"Caja Agrarias\").\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s the Colombian drug cartels had increased their power and in some cases had hired the guerrillas such as the FARC and ELN guerrillas to protect illicit cultivations from the government forces. The most powerful of the cartels; the Medellín and Cali Cartels had engulfed in a war with the government. The Medellín Cartel led by Pablo Escobar also became an enemy later of the FARC in a struggle to control the profitable illegal drug trafficking business. Escobar helped create right wing paramilitary groups. The FARC guerrilla used the revenues from taxing drug lords, and cultivation and production of these to finance their rebel activities.\n\nOn August 18, 1989, the Medellín Cartel assassinated the liberal presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán. César Gaviria replaced him and was then elected president of Colombia. Gaviria avenged the death of Galan by dismantling the Medellín Cartel, but the gap left by this organization was quickly filled by the Cali Cartel and the FARC, which began expanding its influence and armed power in the countryside mainly.\n\nDuring the government of Ernesto Samper the opposing candidate Andrés Pastrana accused President Samper of financing its campaign with money from the Cali Cartel. The political scandal known as the \"8000 Process\" surged and weakened the presidency and government institutions. The United States also conditioned its support for the government, focusing mainly on aiding the military forces on operations against narcotics, that would ultimately help bring down the Cali Cartel.\n\nWithout any major adversaries in the drug business other than the growing AUC paramilitary group, the FARC gained control of most the drug production and trade, as well as financing its political rhetoric and influence over most of the regions in Colombia. With the weakening of the drug cartels the guerrillas became the main issue affecting Colombia. Andrés Pastrana ran for the presidential office again and as a candidate his campaign sustained negotiations with the FARC for a possible peace process.\n\nPastrana then appointed Victor G. Ricardo as High Commissioner for Peace and held conversations with Manuel Marulanda Velez (aka Tirofijo) top commander of the FARC on June 15, 1998. On July 9 elected president Pastrana travelled to the mountains of Colombia and personally met with rebel commanders including \"Tirofijo\" himself.\n\nOn October 8 both sides agreed to create a demilitarized zone in the region of El Caguan, a jungle region in south central Colombia made up by the municipalities of Vista Hermosa, La Macarena, La Uribe and Mesetas in Meta Department, and San Vicente del Caguán in Caquetá Department.\n\nOn August 7, 1998 Pastrana becomes president of Colombia for the period 1998-2002.\n\nOn December 14, 1998, the Pastrana administration and the FARC agreed to begin formal peace talks on January 7, 1999.\n\nThe FARC demanded and proposed certain issues in order to begin; the following were proposed to quell the armed conflict: vision of the conflict, negotiation criteria, preparation of the negotiation, political legitimacy, security, participation, negotiated political settlement, civilian population, recommendations to the civilian population and rules of behavior regarding the masses. The group also considered fundamental topics: democracy, functioning of the state, the public force, social and economic aspects, agrarian reform, natural resources, sovereignty, drug trafficking, paramilitarism and CONVIVIR security groups.\n\nOn the other hand, the government tried to persuade the FARC to leave the Colombian Army Cazadores Battalion, stationed in the area of El Caguan, but FARC opposed. Victor G Ricardo agreed to withdraw the Battalion without consulting military officials. The government urged the FARC to support projects to manually eradicate illegal crops.\n\nAs planned the formal dialogues began on January 7, 1999, in a ceremony at El Caguan with the presence of President Pastrana, but without the presence of \"Tirofijo\". The FARC argued that there was a possible threat to assassinate their commander \"Tirofijo\". FARC negotiator Joaquín Gómez acted on behalf of Tirofijo. President Pastrana said that \"the absence of Manuel Marulanda Velez cannot be a reason to not continue with the instalment of the dialogue to agree on an agenda that will conduct us to peace\". On January 8, \"Tirofijo\" showed up and insisted that there had been a possible assassination attempt.\n\nOn January 11, guerrilla commander Jorge Briceño threatened to kidnap high-profile people if the government did not comply with FARC's demands for a prisoner exchange. Some years before, the FARC had kidnapped a considerable number of military personnel, high-profile politicians and government officials. Pastrana replied with a threat to end the peace process if the FARC carried out the kidnappings. On January 19 the FARC froze the dialogues that the AUC paramilitary groups were resurging and demanded the government to act against these groups and its supporters within the government.\n\nOn February 6 President Pastrana extends the duration of the demilitarized zone and sets it to expire on May 7. Three days later, Pastrana and \"Tirofijo\" finally met publicly and set a new meeting on February 14 to resume dialogues. The FARC had purportedly frozen the peace talks because of the government's spraying of glyphosate to eradicate illegal crops as stated in the Plan Colombia.\n\nBetween February 25 and March 11, three American indigenous-rights activists, Terence Freitas, Lahe'ena'e Gay, and Ingrid Washinawatok were abducted by the FARC in Arauca Department and later assassinated. The FARC admitted the assassination and apologized. The Colombian government then accused a high ranking FARC member known as Germán Briceño (brother of Jorge Briceño) of the assassination and the United States demanded the FARC to hand over the perpetrators. The FARC refused.\n\nFrom April 20 to May 1, both parties met unofficially in El Caguan to discuss the paramilitary issue and the FARC's demands to expand the area of the demilitarized zone, which was due to expire on May 7, and to extend the timeframe.\n\nOn May 2, President Pastrana travelled to the demilitarized zone and personally met with \"Tirofijo\" for a second time. Pastrana convinced him to begin formal peace-talks on May 6. It was agreed that the demilitarized area would remain in size, but its expiration would be postponed. Another decision was to form an International Verification Commission to observe the agreements and the FARC's actions in the area.\n\nOn May 26, Colombian Minister of Defense, Rodrigo Lloreda resigned after criticising the president's handling of the peace process. Lloreda opposed the indefinite extension of the timeline of the demilitarized area. The High Commissioner for Peace's remarks suggesting an extension of the demilitarized area for the FARC triggered a discontent in some servicemen in the Colombian military; 18 generals also tried to resign but the president only accepted Lloreda's. The head of the armed forces, Gen. Fernando Tapias, offered President Pastrana a public show of support. Pastrana then appointed Luis Fernando Ramírez as Defense Minister.\n\nThe Center for International Policy led a delegation of US Congressmen to Colombia. Among the representatives was William Delahunt (D-MA) and six other members of Congress, who met with government officials and representatives of political parties, church groups, peace groups, human rights groups, US government employees stationed in Colombia and the United Nations. On June 4 the delegation of US representatives travelled to El Caguan to meet with rebel leaders. They held talks without results with guerrilla commander Raúl Reyes regarding the drug trade, kidnappings and the assassination of US citizens, specially related to the three US indigenous workers.\n\nThe government then announced that the formal negotiations with the FARC would begin on July 7. But a day before, both parties postponed the peace talks until July 19 alleging that three of FARC's negotiators could not arrive on time to the meeting, the FARC argued that they also needed more time to organize their positions regarding the International Commission, as agreed between \"Tirofijo\" and President Pastrana.\n\nBetween 8–12 July the FARC launched an armed offensive (called by them as \"armed strikes\" from the ), in which the guerrilla group attacked 15 small towns and targeted infrastructure; mainly commercial banks, bridges and energy infrastructure, random kidnappings (Colloquially called in Colombian ) as well as assaulting numerous National Police small posts. The Military of Colombia, with the help of the U.S. government, counterattacked by bombing guerrilla enclaves using U.S. provided satellite intelligence.\n\nOn July 15, 1999 Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramírez and the Colombian General of the Chief of Staff Fernando Tapias requested US$500 million as aid to fund counter-narcotics and counter-insurgency warfare. The then head of the US Office of National Drug Control Policy Barry McCaffrey called for a billion dollar as supplemental assistance for the war on drugs in South America, half of it to be assigned to Colombia.\n\n", "id": "7731766", "categories": ["FARC", "Colombian conflict (1964–present)", "Colombian peace process", "20th century in Colombia", "21st century in Colombia", "Dispute resolution"], "title": "1999–2002 FARC–Government peace process"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7731812", "text": "South African Sheepdog Association\n\nThe South African Sheepdog Association (SASDA) is an association responsible for organising and controlling sheepdog related activities in South Africa. This involves overseeing the competitions (sheepdog trials) that are held by regional clubs during the year and maintaining the stud book to manage the registration of sheepdogs in South Africa. It also works with the regional clubs in an effort to further the spread of interest in sheepdogs as useful working resources in the life of the stock farmer and to encourage handlers to participate in competition. Competition is seen as a way to maintain the standard of breeding and training of working sheepdogs.\n\nThe South African Sheepdog Association was established in 1961 when a group of farmers in the Karoo came together to discuss the future of the sheepdog in South Africa. The inaugural meeting, with 13 members present, was held at Union High School in Graaff Reinet and Mr Bun Kingwill was elected as the first president of the association.\nDuring the South African championship of that year, \"Tess\" of Mr Billy Kingwill became the first South African champion under the watchful eye of the judge, Mr Henry Hartzenberg of Graaff Reinet.\nSince the inauguration of SASDA a South African championship has been held each year.\nOver time the course has also changed, to upgrade the standard and difficulty to improve the dog's working ability. In the beginning the course was very much like the ones used in Australia but gradually changed to the English version.\nThe current course with the double lift, which has been implemented in 2001, has been taken over virtually as is from the one used for the international championship in the United Kingdom and in so doing putting South African dogs and handlers on the same foot as their overseas counterparts.\nThrough the years the South African Sheepdog Association still strives toward its main objective – to introduce farmers and other interested people to sheepdogs as a labour saving force. This is done through demonstrations and courses, as well as competitions, where breeding success is tested and the best breeding material selected according to working ability.\nThe previous logo appears on the right.\n\nThe association is made up of a number of regional clubs, loosely based on the provinces and regions of South Africa, together with a central office responsible for the maintenance of the registration of dogs and breeders.\n\nEach club typically holds one trial a year. They normally run for two to three days and are usually arranged in such a way as to give each dog at least two opportunities to compete. Trials that comply with certain standards, including a minimum entry, will be able to advertise as 'Dog of the Year' (DOY) trials. Competitors taking part in these trials will be able to accumulate points towards the DOY competition.\n\nOnce a year a national trial is held. It is generally referred to as 'The Nationals'. Handlers all compete on the same trial field on an equal footing and after a number of rounds the most successful dog is awarded the title of National Champion. At the same event the dog that has accumulated the most points at 'Dog of the Year' trials since the last Nationals competition is awarded the title of South Africa Dog of the Year.\n\nDuring club competition dogs compete in three different categories: \"juniors\", \"seniors\" and \"top dogs\". Juniors don't do the more challenging tests of skill like shedding and must win a junior trial to qualify for seniors. To qualify for top dogs a dog must win a senior competition and attain a score of at least 90% of the points on offer on the same run. The course for top dogs is more of a test. It includes narrow drive gates and may include a double lift or some other additional test.\n\nMost club trials include a further category: \"beginners\". Any dog can compete in a beginner competition. To qualify for beginner the \"handler\" must have never competed in any other trial category. This category was introduced to encourage novices to become part of the family of competitors.\n\nSASDA have tried to maintain links with similar organisations in other countries. Over the years several experienced handlers from England, Wales, Scotland and the USA have been invited to come and judge important trials, most often the Nationals. The 2006 Nationals were judged by Dick Roper from England. Most international judges invited to travel to judge trials are also invited to run workshops to encourage the sharing of ideas.\n\nSouth African dogs are not allowed to compete in Europe without first completing six months of quarantine but South African dogs have competed in the USA. In 2005 Faansie Basson and Wally Ward represented South Africa in the USA. At the Meeker Classic Faansie Basson finished 8th in the final with \"Lad\".\n\nHandlers have brought dogs from Europe to compete in South Africa in the past. To do this, before they travel to South Africa, they need to arrange to sell the dogs they bring to local handlers after the competition so that they can leave them behind when they leave.\n\nOccasionally handlers from neighbouring countries will compete in regional trials although this is more the exception than the rule.\n\n\n", "id": "7731812", "categories": ["Dog organizations", "Dog breed registries"], "title": "South African Sheepdog Association"}

It is the highpoint on the ridge between Harter Fell and Shipman Knotts.\n\nThe western Kentmere slopes fall over the rough ground of Hallow Bank Quarter to Ullstone Gill, a tributary of the River Kent. Beyond here Smallthwaite Knott, an outlier of Harter Fell, separates Kentmere Pike from the main valley. There is extensive evidence of former quarrying on this flank.\n\nBy contrast the Longsleddale side wears a rim of crag above the narrow upper course of the River Sprint. Goat Scar, Raven Crag and Brown Crags are the main faces, while Steel Pike appears from the valley bridleway as an independent rocky peak. The remains of the large Wrengill Quarry are just north of here, together with a mine entrance a little higher up the slope.\n\nThe ridge northwards to Harter Fell drops to a wet depression and then climbs up the grassy ridge, following first the wall and then a broken fence. South-eastwards the ridge continues to the cairned top of Goat Scar, which provides a good viewpoint for the craggy throat of Longsleddale. From here the high ground turns due south to Shipman Knotts.\n\nThe top of the fell is a grassy dome with a stone wall running along the ridge. An Ordnance Survey column stands just to the east of the wall whilst a small summit cairn has been built to the west. Both are of equivalent height. The view of Lakeland is intermittent between the tops on the Ill Bell ridge, the Coniston fells and a portion of the Scafell group being visible. An open vista to the south encompasses Windermere and Morecambe Bay.\n\nKentmere Pike is most commonly climbed indirectly as part of the Kentmere Horseshoe. This circuit takes in the fine ridges on either side of the valley, together with the higher fells at its head. Direct ascents can also be made from either flank. An ancient grooved path rises up the fellside from the end of High Lane in Kentmere, meeting the ridgetop wall to the south of the summit. From Longsleddale the walled track which leads to Gatesgarth Pass can be left just north of Steel Pike. The line of an old fence is then followed to the ridge.\n", "id": "7731813", "categories": ["Hewitts of England", "Fells of the Lake District"], "title": "Kentmere Pike"}

CUDOS is an Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence and was formally launched in 2003.\n\nCUDOS commenced operation in 2003 as one of the first Australian Research Council Centres of Excellence, and began with 4 research programs across 7 groups. \n\nIt continued through 2007 when ARC renewed funding for another 3 years. \n\nThe latest incarnation is based on new ARC funding from 2011-2017, with Australian and international researchers collaborating on 6 new Flagship projects. \n\nCUDOS is a research consortium between 8 groups at 6 Australian Universities: The University of Sydney (CUDOS headquarters), Australian National University, Macquarie University, University of Technology Sydney, RMIT University and Monash University.\n\nThe Research Director is Professor Ben Eggleton, with Professor Yuri Kivshar as Deputy Director and Professor Martijn de Sterke as Associate Director.\n\nCUDOS aims to be the world-leader in research in on-chip photonics, for all-optical signal processing. The centre conducts research to create a world-best on-chip photonic platform for information transfer and processing technologies. CUDOS aims to translate the intellectual capital, which the researchers create to build a community of professionals which can drive wealth creation in Australia.\n\nCUDOS brings together a powerful team of Australian and international researchers in optical science and photonics technology, and has played a pivotal role in demonstrating ground-breaking integrated photonic signal processors that can massively increase the information capacity of the Internet.\n\nThe centre currently has six Flagship Projects.\n\nFunctional Metamaterials and Metadevices: Metamaterials are synthesised on the sub-wavelength scale to have optical properties (refractive index, dispersion) that can differ dramatically from those of bulk materials: perfect lenses, cloaking, and negative refractive index materials are examples. CUDOS aims to develop metamaterials that will enable entirely new ways to control photons.\n\nOn-chip Nanoplasmonics: The refractive index of metals is very high, so the wavelength of the optical modes is very short. CUDOS is developing novel techniques to fabricate nano-structured composites of metals and optically transmitting materials. They are investigating novel modes of light propagation in these materials and use them to create ultracompact devices like transmission lines and antennae. The vision of this project is to develop three- and two-dimensional nanoplasmonic structures that can allow unprecedented control of light at the sub wavelength scale.\n\nHybrid integration: As metamaterials, nanoplasmonic materials and new kinds of nonlinear optical materials are developed, they need to be integrated with existing optical platforms of silicon or chalcogenide, so that light can pass from one material to another on the same ‘chip’. This project aims to develop novel designs for integrating such hybrid materials, and novel fabrication techniques.\n\nMid-Infrared Photonics: The mid-infrared region of the spectrum (3 – 10 µm) has enormous potential for highly efficient sensing of molecules significant in agriculture, natural resource management, homeland security, and others. CUDOS developed photonic platforms and novel sources for this region.\n\nNonlinear Quantum Photonics: This research focuses on highly compact approaches based on nonlinear optics to generate single photons. The aim is to achieve this on a chip and create a fully integrated flexible platform to generate these single photons and use them to perform quantum-based processing operations.\n\nTerabit per second Photonics: All-optical processing has the potential to replace electronics in many areas of ultrahigh bandwidth communications systems. CUDOS is developing all-optical processors, using nonlinear optics, and investigating new approaches to enable much higher volumes of data to be carried per unit of optical bandwidth.\n\nCUDOS research has been working towards optical circuitry which could result in much faster speeds for data transmission.\n\n", "id": "7731824", "categories": ["Technology consortia", "Science and technology in Australia"], "title": "Centre for Ultrahigh Bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems"}

Specifically, every constant is interpreted as itself, and every function symbol is interpreted as the function that applies it. The interpretation also defines predicate symbols as denoting a subset of the relevant Herbrand base, effectively specifying which ground atoms are true in the interpretation. This allows the symbols in a set of clauses to be interpreted in a purely syntactic way, separated from any real instantiation.\n\nThe importance of Herbrand interpretations is that, if any interpretation satisfies a given set of clauses \"S\" then there is a Herbrand interpretation that satisfies them. Moreover, Herbrand's theorem states that if \"S\" is unsatisfiable then there is a finite unsatisfiable set of ground instances from the Herbrand universe defined by \"S\". Since this set is finite, its unsatisfiability can be verified in finite time. However there may be an infinite number of such sets to check. \n\nIt is named after Jacques Herbrand.\n\n", "id": "7731831", "categories": ["Mathematical logic"], "title": "Herbrand interpretation"}

The movie was directed by Herbert Brenon and produced and released through MGM Studios.\n\nThe film is based on the 1923 Broadway stage production \"Laugh, Clown, Laugh,\" by David Belasco and Tom Cushing, based on a 1919 play \"Ridi, Pagliaccio\" by .\n\nTito (Lon Chaney), a traveling circus clown, finds an abandoned child. Tito adopts her and raises her as his daughter, naming her Simonetta after his brother Simon (Bernard Siegel). One day the now teen-aged Simonetta (Loretta Young) encounters Luigi (Nils Asther), a wealthy man who falls madly in love with her, but upon seeing that he already has a girlfriend, she rejects him. She returns home to the circus and Tito suddenly realizes she is no longer a child. Tito further realizes he has feelings for Simonetta, but also knows his feelings are improper because he raised her as his daughter.\n\nLuigi begins having fits of uncontrollable laughter because Simonetta has rejected him. Tito falls into melancholia because of his conflicted interests about Simonetta. They both see the same doctor about their conditions and meet for the first time. They share their respective troubles and believe they can help each other, not knowing they both love the same woman. Nonetheless, the three eventually develop a strong friendship until Luigi asks Simonetta to marry him. Simonetta eventually accepts Luigi's proposal, which throws Tito into an even deeper melancholy. Simonetta learns of Tito's affections for her before she marries Luigi. She tells Tito she loved him before she loved Luigi, then goes to break her engagement with Luigi.\n\nWhile Simonetta is breaking her engagement, Tito and Simon begin rehearsing some new material for their Flik and Flok act. Tito does not believe Simonetta's love is genuine, but that it is just pity and at the same time, he knows that as her adopted father - it would not be right to have her as his wife. Driven insane by his internal conflict, he decides to practice his new routine from the act without protection. Despite his brother Simon's protests, he continues with the stunt and falls from the highwire.\n\nTito dies from his fall, freeing Simonetta to marry Luigi.\n\nThe film survives in an incomplete print, but the missing footage does not critically affect the storyline. The surviving print seems to end rather abruptly, as the last few seconds of the fadeout are among the lost footage. The alternate happy ending - wherein Tito survives his fall and Simonetta marries Luigi, and they all remain close friends - shot at the studio's insistence, has also been lost.\n\n\nThe film is based on the 1923 Broadway stage production \"Laugh, Clown, Laugh\" that starred Lionel Barrymore and his second wife Irene Fenwick in the role of Simonetta. The play by David Belasco and Tom Cushing, based on a 1919 story \"Ridi, Pagliaccio\" by , ran at the Belasco Theatre from November 28, 1923 to March 1924, for a total of 133 performances. The production also featured Lucille Kahn in a supporting role.\n\nMGM delayed production of this film several years, because Chaney had already appeared as a clown character in the 1924 film \"He Who Gets Slapped\" and due to speculation that Lionel Barrymore might reprise his role from the stage production. As a substitute, MGM would pair Barrymore with Chaney in \"West of Zanzibar\".\n\nAs a trouping comic stage actor in his youth, Chaney would have been acquainted with clown performers of lesser-known fame. In preparation for this film and \"He Who Gets Slapped\" Chaney also studied the clown makeup of circus performers and legendary 19th-century clown stage actors like Joseph Grimaldi and George L. Fox, the latter of Humpty Dumpty fame. The film was said to have been Chaney's favorite of all his roles.\n\nThis film was Loretta Young's first major movie role, at the age of fourteen. In interviews near the end of her life, she expressed her gratitude toward Chaney for his kindness and guidance, and for protecting her from director Brenon's sometimes harsh treatment.\n\nAn eponymous musical theme was written specially for the film. It was seemingly played for audiences in movie theatres [in the minutes before screenings of the movie]. It became a hit record. Chaney's set musicians played the song at his 1930 funeral.\n\nAuthor and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of a possible four stars, calling it \" the perfect example of Chaney's unmatched talent for turning tearjerking melodrama into heartbreaking tragedy.\"\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nIn January 2002, the third annual Young Film Composers Competition sponsored by Turner Classic Movies awarded the right to re-score this film to a college student named Scott Salinas. In November 2002, he scored it at Todd-AO, with the film first aired in February 2003.\n\n", "id": "7731853", "categories": ["American silent feature films", "American films based on plays", "American black-and-white films", "1928 films", "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films", "American romantic drama films", "Films directed by Herbert Brenon", "American films", "Films about clowns"], "title": "Laugh, Clown, Laugh"}

The stadium was constructed from September 1931 until 1932 and cost £70,000 to build and after completion £18,000 in wages had been paid to the builders.\n\nHackney opened On Friday 8 April 1932 under the affiliation of the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS) the rival to the larger National Greyhound Racing Club. Thirteen thousand people attended the first night and witnessed Marjorie Graves, MP for South Hackney officially open the track. The capacity of the track was put between 30,000-50,000 and a totalisator had been installed for the first night. A greyhound called Bullseye became the first ever winner at the track. Although the meeting was advertised as the first official meeting there had been a dress rehearsal two days previous on Wednesday 6 April which attracted 12,000 people.\n\nThe company responsible for the project was Hackney Wick Stadium Ltd headed by Managing Director Arthur Gilbert and Racing Manager Fred Whitehead with William Chandler also holding shares in the new company, Chandler would in due course buy the Crooked Billet independent track and turn it into Walthamstow Stadium one year later.\n\nAfter World War II Hendon Greyhound Stadium and Hackney Wick merged to become the Hackney and Hendon Greyhounds Ltd company. The resident kennels featured six ranges with each able to house up to fifty greyhounds, paddocks sat next to each range with cooking facilities and a veterinary surgeon on site. The kennel fees were 17s 6d for each greyhound.\n\nIn the early 1950s Mr S Pay became the Racing Manager after Fred Whitehead was promoted to Director of Racing for both Hackney and Hendon. Pay was later replaced by Hendon Racing Manager D G Lewis before Michael Marksbecame Racing Manager for three decades until the day the stadium closed. The stadium offered eight buffet and licensed bars during racing held on Thursday and Saturday nights at 7.45pm. The circuit had a circumference of 472 yards and the greyhounds raced behind an 'Outside Sumner' hare system. Trainers in the 1960s included Annetts, Reg Bosley, Brown, Colebrooke, Cox, Paddy Gordon, Hedley and Lionel Maxen.\n\nIn the 1970s Mr G.Crookbank the tracks chief electrician had invented photoelectric timing gear that would revolutionise the sport. Hand timing would become a thing of the past after Crookbank came up with the idea that a greyhound’s race time could be recorded electronically. The invention known as 'Automatic Ray Timing' would remain as the timing method until the advent of modern computer timing. The Hackney sales became a major feature of business throughout the year, these sales became a prominent way for buying and selling greyhounds in London.\n\nIn 1969 Park Royal Stadium and New Cross Stadium both closed resulting in the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) being switched to Hendon and Hackney, the racing image of Hackney would change forever as it became the number one BAGS track. Afternoon meetings were introduced and eventually there would be no evening meetings at the track with the Saturday matinee BAGS replacing the Saturday night.\n\nIn 1970 businessman George Walker, brother of boxing champion Billy Walker arranged a reverse takeover of Hackney and Hendon Greyhounds Stadium Ltd. This meant his private company bought a public company and the new merger resulted in a new company called Brent Walker. This resulted in the end for the Hendon Greyhound Stadium because it was sold to make way for the UK’s first stand-alone shopping centre on the site that would soon be known as the Brent Cross shopping centre.\n\nIt was not until the closure of sister track Hendon that Hackney Wick hosted a competition of note. The Guineas long associated with Park Royal had switched to Hendon in 1969 which in turn now found its way to Hackney. Three years later 'The Lead' was introduced and would also become a valuable addition to the calendar. In 1976 local hound Westmead Champ trained by Pam Heasman reached the final of the English Greyhound Derby and was voted Greyhound of the Year.\n\nHackney fell out with the NGRC in 1987 when the governing body announced that they would charge £300 to a track staging a BAGS meeting covered by Satellite Information Services (S.I.S) plus ten percent of the tracks BAGS fees. Hackney refused and Ladbrokes took legal advice over the situation but all BAGS tracks would eventually pay a fee to the NGRC. Another race called the Lincoln was hosted by Hackney from 1986 and in 1988 Minnies Siren trained by Terry Duggan won the BBC Television Trophy. Brent Walker bought William Hill/Mecca from Grand Metropolitan in 1989 and one year later leading trainer John 'Ginger' McGee Sr. joined the track.\n\n\nDuring 1991 it transpired that Brent Walker had amassed debts of £1.2 billion, George Walker was removed from the board and the banker took control of the company’s assets. With the bank controlling matters there were numerous rumours about the future of the track. By 1994 the stadium had been acquired by a company called London Stadium Hackney Ltd who were in turn owned by Fleetfoot Racing formed in 1992. Work began on an ambitious project including a £12 million restaurant and state of the art facilities, leading trainers were recruited and the stadium was rebranded 'The London Stadium'.\n\nAt the end of 1994 ex-Lloyds broker and racing journalist Robert Parker left the company as its director to be replaced by Stephen Rea. Beset with construction problems and internal disagreements the original £14 million scheme to develop the neglected stadium had run into serious problems. Extra cash was raised by rights issues with companies including Rothschild, Henderson Venture Managers and Samuel Montagu. In October 1995 the new stadium was finally ready offering first-class facilities and significantly high prize money. However on the reopening night and despite a capacity crowd the stadium went into receivership the same evening. Investigations began and Parker was pursued by Roger Cook on ITV’s television program \"The Cook Report\". Fleetfoot Racing Ltd had lasted just three years and the stadium was closed on 4 January 1997.\n\nThe stadium was left derelict for several years until it was bought by the London Development Agency and demolished in 2003. The site was the location of the London Olympics Media Centre, the main media and broadcasting centre for the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics.\n\nHackney Wick Wolves speedway team raced there before World War II . The Hackney Hawks speedway team rode at the venue from 1963 to 1983. Hackney Kestrels speedway team rode here from 1984 until 1990. In 1996, a speedway team under the name of London Lions rode but it was found to be financially unviable.\n\nThe British Speedway Grand Prix was held at the stadium in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe speedway track was in length.\n\n\n", "id": "7731905", "categories": ["Greyhound racing in London", "Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park", "Defunct sports venues in London", "Sports venues demolished in 2003", "Demolished buildings and structures in London", "Sports venues in London", "Defunct greyhound racing venues in London", "Demolished sports venues in the United Kingdom", "Defunct speedway venues in England", "Sports venues completed in 1932", "Defunct greyhound racing venues in the United Kingdom", "Former buildings and structures in the London Borough of Hackney"], "title": "Hackney Wick Stadium"}

It was inaugurated in 1989.\n\nDespite its name, the GPE is not limited to European choirs; this is because choirs from any country can join the choral competitions in any of the GPE's member-cities. , one choir from Japan, one choir from Argentina, one choir from Indonesia, and two choirs from the United States have won the GPE, while two choirs from the Philippines and United States has won the GPE twice. In addition, the contest is not limited to adult choirs; three of the grand prize-winning choirs are children's choirs.\n\nAs of 2018, five choirs have won the EGP twice: the Philippine Madrigal Singers (1997 and 2007), APZ Tone Tomšič (2002 and 2008), Youth choir \"Kamēr...\" (2004 and 2013), University of Utah Chamber Choir (renamed from the University of Utah Singers) (2006 and 2015) and Vesna Children's Choir (2000 and 2017).\n\nAs of 2010, only one conductor has won the EGP twice: Stojan Kuret (2002 and 2010).\n\nThe GPE is organized by the organizing committees of the following choral competitions, from which the GPE contenders are selected:\n\nEach individual contest is usually referred to by the name of its host city instead of the competition's official title. The grand prize winners of each contest are automatically eligible to compete at the GPE.\n\nThe hosting of each annual GPE competition is rotated among the six member cities.\n\nThe European Grand Prix for Choral Singing was created in 1988 through the initiative of the competitions of AREZZO (Italy), DEBRECEN (Hungary), GORIZIA (Italy) and TOURS (France) Two others have also been associated: VARNA (Bulgaria) in 1989, and TOLOSA (Basque Country/Spain) in 1990. In 2008 Gorizia stepped out of the Association and MARIBOR (Slovenia) joined it.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the contest is open only to the grand prize winners of the six member European choral competitions in the previous year. In other words, if a choir wins the grand prize in any of the six cities' choral contests, it is eligible for then next year's GPE. Consequently, this also means that, unlike other choral competitions, the GPE does not solicit participants to the contest; no choir may directly apply or audition in order to join the GPE. If an eligible choir backs out, a substitute choir may take its place; as a penalty, any choir that backs out will not be eligible to compete in any of the six qualifying contests for the next year.\n\nNo choir may win the grand prize in more than one qualifying competition in a single year. For example, if a choir is named the grand prize winner in Arezzo, it is automatically disqualified to compete in the contests from the five remaining cities for the rest of the year.\n\nThere are no specific regulations prohibiting a former finalist (or even a former laureate) from competing in (or even winning again) the GPE more than once. The Philippine Madrigal Singers (laureate of the 1997 GPE) have won the 2006 \"Florilège Vocal de Tours\", going on to win the Grand Prize in 2007 in Arezzo, Italy. In the same competition, the Madrigal Singers competed with the Vesna Children's Choir (laureate of the 2000 GPE), who won the grand prize of the 2006 Tolosa competition.\n\nEach competing choir is required to sing in the same group/category as they performed in respective competitions. Choirs are encouraged to perform songs from various eras and composers. Songs with accompaniment (by any instrument) are allowed as long as the total length of accompanied songs does not exceed ten (10) minutes. The host city determines the total maximum performance time allowed to each finalist.\n\nEach competing choir is also required to have the same number of singers it had from the qualifying competition, plus or minus ten percent (10%) of that number.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7731934", "text": "Gamma secretase\n\nGamma secretase is a multi-subunit protease complex, itself an integral membrane protein, that cleaves single-pass transmembrane proteins at residues within the transmembrane domain. Proteases of this type are known as intramembrane proteases. The most well-known substrate of gamma secretase is amyloid precursor protein, a large integral membrane protein that, when cleaved by both gamma and beta secretase, produces a short 37-43 amino acid peptide called amyloid beta whose abnormally folded fibrillar form is the primary component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Gamma secretase is also critical in the related processing of several other type I integral membrane proteins, such as Notch, ErbB4, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, ephrin-B2, or CD44.\n\nThe gamma secretase complex consists of four individual proteins: PSEN1 (presenilin-1), nicastrin, APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective 1), and PEN-2 (presenilin enhancer 2). Recent evidence suggests that a fifth protein, known as CD147, is a non-essential regulator of the complex whose absence increases activity. Presenilin, an aspartyl protease, is the catalytic subunit; mutations in the presenilin gene have been shown to be a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and modultes immune cell activity. In humans, two forms of presenilin and two forms of APH-1 have been identified in the genome; one of the APH homologs can also be expressed in two isoforms via alternative splicing, leading to at least six different possible gamma secretase complexes that may have tissue- or cell type specificity.\n\nThe proteins in the gamma secretase complex are heavily modified by proteolysis during assembly and maturation of the complex; a required activation step is in the autocatalytic cleavage of presenilin to N- and C-terminal fragments. Nicastrin's primary role is in maintaining the stability of the assembled complex and regulating intracellular protein trafficking. PEN-2 associates with the complex via binding of a transmembrane domain of presenilin and, among other possible roles, helps to stabilize the complex after presenilin proteolysis has generated the activated N-terminal and C-terminal fragments. APH-1, which is required for proteolytic activity, binds to the complex via a conserved alpha helix interaction motif and aids in initiating assembly of premature components.\n\nRecent research has shown that interaction of the gamma secretase complex with the γ-secretase activating protein facilitates the gamma cleavage of amyloid precursor protein into β-amyloid.\n\nThe gamma secretase complex is thought to assemble and mature via proteolysis in the early endoplasmic reticulum. The complexes are then transported to the late ER where they interact with and cleave their substrate proteins. Gamma secretase complexes have also been observed localized to the mitochondria, where they may play a role in promoting apoptosis.\n\nGamma secretase is an internal protease that cleaves within the membrane-spanning domain of its substrate proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch. Substrate recognition occurs via nicastrin ectodomain binding to the N-terminus of the target, which is then passed via a poorly understood process between the two presenilin fragments to a water-containing active site where the catalytic aspartate residue is located. The active site must contain water to carry out hydrolysis within a hydrophobic environment in the interior of the cell membrane, although it is not well understood how water and proton exchange is effected, and as yet no X-ray crystallography structure of gamma secretase is available. Low-resolution electron microscopy reconstructions have allowed the visualization of the hypothesized internal pores of about 2 nanometres. In 2014, a three-dimensional structure of an intact human gamma-secretase complex was determined by cryo-electron microscopy single-particle analysis at 4.5 angstrom resolution and in 2015 an atomic-resolution (3.4 angstrom) cryo-EM structure was reported.\n\nThe gamma secretase complex is unusual among proteases in having a \"sloppy\" cleavage site at the C-terminal site in amyloid beta generation; gamma secretase can cleave APP in any of multiple sites to generate a peptide of variable length, most typically from 39 to 42 amino acids long, with Aβ40 the most common isoform and Aβ42 the most susceptible to conformational changes leading to amyloid fibrillogenesis. Certain mutations in both APP and in both types of human presenilin are associated with increased Aβ42 production and the early-onset genetic form of familial Alzheimer's disease. Although older data suggested that different forms of the gamma secretase complex could be differentially responsible for generating different amyloid beta isoforms, current evidence indicates that the C-terminus of amyloid beta is produced by a series of single-residue cleavages by the same gamma secretase complex. Earlier cleavage sites produce peptides of length 46 (zeta-cleavage) and 49 (epsilon-cleavage).\n\n", "id": "7731934", "categories": ["EC 3.4", "Alzheimer's disease", "Integral membrane proteins"], "title": "Gamma secretase"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7732020", "text": "History of Arsenal F.C. (1886–1966)\n\nThe history of Arsenal Football Club between 1886 and 1966 covers the time from the club's foundation, through the first two major periods of success (the 1930s, and the late 1940s and early 1950s, respectively) and the club's subsequent decline to mid-table status in the 1960s.\n\nArsenal Football Club was founded in 1886 as a munition workers' team from Woolwich, then in Kent, now southeast London. They turned professional in 1891 and joined The Football League two years later. They were promoted to the First Division in 1904 but financial problems meant they were liquidated and reformed. They were bought out by Sir Henry Norris that year and to improve the club's financial standing, he moved the team to Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, north London in 1913. After the First World War he arranged for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in controversial circumstances.\n\nIt was not until the appointment of Herbert Chapman in 1925 that Arsenal had their first period of major success; Chapman modernised and reformed the club's practices and tactics, and under him and his successor George Allison (who took over after Chapman's death in January 1934), Arsenal won five First Division titles and two FA Cups in the 1930s. After the Second World War, Tom Whittaker continued the success, leading the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup. After Whittaker's death Arsenal's fortunes gradually declined; by 1966, they were in mid-table obscurity and had not won a trophy in thirteen years. This led to the dismissal of Billy Wright as manager in 1966, and with it the appointment of Bertie Mee, who would go on to turn around the club's fortunes.\n\nArsenal were founded as Dial Square in 1886 by a group of workers employed by the Dial Square workshop at the Royal Arsenal, an armaments factory in Woolwich, Kent (formally part of the new County of London from 1889). They were led by a Scotsman, David Danskin, who purchased the club's first football, and Jack Humble. Among their number was the former Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Fred Beardsley, who would later along with Morris Bates obtain a set of red kits from his old club, thus giving Arsenal the colours they still wear today.\n\nDial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against Eastern Wanderers on an open field on the Isle of Dogs, which they won 6–0. The club were renamed \"Royal Arsenal\" soon after, reportedly on Christmas Day. Initially the club played on Plumstead Common, but soon sought alternative homes, firstly the Sportsman Ground in Plumstead before moving to the adjacent Manor Ground in 1888. Unhappy with the Manor Ground's poor facilities, the club moved to the nearby Invicta Ground in 1890, before returning to the Manor Ground three years later as the Invicta Ground's rent proved too expensive.\n\nDuring this period, Royal Arsenal started to win local trophies, winning both the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; they also entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1889–90. However, the gulf between Arsenal and the professional sides from the North soon became apparent, and Arsenal faced the threat of their amateur players being lured away by the money professional sides could offer; after Derby County had played Arsenal in an FA Cup tie in 1891, they attempted to sign two of Arsenal's amateur players on professional contracts.\nRoyal Arsenal's move to professionalism in 1891 was frowned upon by many of the amateur southern clubs, and they were banned from participating in local competitions by the London Football Association. With friendlies and the FA Cup the only matches available for Royal Arsenal, they attempted to set up a southern equivalent of The Football League, but the move failed. The club changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal in 1893 when it formed a limited liability company to raise capital to purchase the Manor Ground. Woolwich Arsenal's future looked bleak until the Football League came to their rescue by inviting them to join in 1893. Arsenal were the first Southern club to enter the League, initially joining the Second Division; in response, some of the club's amateur players who rejected professionalism and wanted a workers' team to represent just the Royal Arsenal, broke away to form a short-lived alternative side, Royal Ordnance Factories.\nWoolwich Arsenal played in the Second Division for eleven seasons, and generally occupied mid-table before the appointment of Harry Bradshaw as manager in 1899; Bradshaw and his star signings, including goalkeeper Jimmy Ashcroft (Arsenal's first England international) and captain Jimmy Jackson, won promotion to the First Division in 1903–04. However, Bradshaw moved on to Fulham in May 1904, before the Gunners had kicked a ball in the top flight. Despite some strong performances in the FA Cup – the club reached the semi-finals in 1905–06 and 1906–07 – Arsenal were never able to challenge for the League title, only twice finishing above tenth place in the First Division between 1904 and 1913.\n\nThe cause of this decline was the club's ongoing financial problems; despite the boom in football during the early 20th century, the club's geographic isolation, in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead (then on the outskirts of urban London), meant attendances and thus income were low. To stay afloat, Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players (including Ashcroft, as well as Tim Coleman and Bert Freeman), and slowly started to slip down the table, which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell. By the end of the decade the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11,000, a little over half of what it had been in 1904. The club were close to bankruptcy, and in 1910 went into voluntary liquidation before being bought out by a consortium of businessmen; the largest shareholder amongst the new owners was the property magnate Sir Henry Norris, who was also the chairman of Fulham.\n\nNorris was acutely aware of the problems associated with Woolwich Arsenal's location, and was desperate to improve the club's income. First, Norris tried to merge Woolwich Arsenal with his other club, Fulham. When that was blocked by the Football League, Norris abandoned the merger and looked to move the club elsewhere, eventually picking a site in Highbury, north London. Despite objections both from Woolwich-based fans and residents of Highbury, Norris tenaciously saw the move through. He reportedly spent £125,000 ( Historic Opportunity cost of that project is £12,530,000,\nLabour cost of that project is £42,450,000,\nEconomic cost of that project is £88,070,000) on building the new stadium, designed by Archibald Leitch, on a divinity college's playing fields. Woolwich Arsenal moved there in the 1913 close season, having finished bottom and relegated to the Second Division in 1912–13. They replaced the \"Woolwich\" in their name with \"The\" in April 1914, finally becoming plain \"Arsenal\" in November 1919, although the press at the time continued to refer to them as \"The Arsenal\" and some still do. The move to Highbury brought about much larger crowds; the average attendance in Arsenal's first season at the new ground was 23,000 (compared to 11,000 at the Manor Ground) and rose further after promotion in 1919, finally warding off the spectre of financial ruin.\n\nThe club controversially rejoined the First Division in 1919, despite only finishing sixth in 1914–15, the last season of competitive football before the First World War had intervened — although an error in the calculation of goal average meant Arsenal had actually finished fifth, an error which was corrected by the Football League in 1975. The First Division was being expanded from 20 teams to 22, and the two new entrants were elected at an AGM of the Football League. On past precedent the two places would be given to the two clubs that would otherwise have been relegated, namely Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. Instead one of the extra places was awarded to Chelsea - who had been the victims of a betting controversy - and a ballot was called for the remaining place. The candidates included 20th-placed Tottenham Hotspur and, from the second division, Barnsley (who had finished third); Wolves, (fourth); Birmingham (fifth later amended to sixth); Hull City (seventh); and Nottingham Forest (eighteenth).\n\nThe League voted to promote sixth-placed Arsenal, for reasons of history over merit; Norris argued that Arsenal be promoted for their \"long service to league football\", having been the first League club from the South. The League board agreed; Arsenal received 18 votes, Tottenham 8. Barnsley 5, Wolves 4 with a further 6 votes shared between the other clubs.\n\nAccording to Soar and Tyler, the announcement of the vote seemed to catch all the clubs, except Arsenal, unawares and the affair is a major contributing factor to the rivalry which has fuelled the long-standing enmity between the two North London clubs. There is also an inconsistency in the argument - if \"long service to league football\" was the criterion for promoting Arsenal instead of Tottenham then Wolves, who finished two points ahead of Arsenal and were founder members of the Football League, would appear to have a stronger claim. It has been alleged that this was due to backroom deals or even outright bribery by Sir Henry Norris, colluding with his friend John McKenna, the chairman of Liverpool and the Football League, who recommended Arsenal's promotion at the AGM.\n\nNo conclusive proof of wrongdoing has come to light, though other aspects of Norris's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter; Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities; he was found to have misused his expenses account, and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus. Regardless of the circumstances of their promotion in 1919, Arsenal have remained in the top division since then, and as a result hold the English record for the longest unbroken stretch of top-flight football.\n\nThere appear to be no extant records of the meetings which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919, however the book \"Making the Arsenal\" proposes a different reason for their election in that year. The site argues that the match fixing issues of the final year of football before the war (1914–15) were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted. He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United (some of whose players had been found guilty of match fixing) be punished by relegation or expulsion, and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done. To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division.\n\nThe club's return to the First Division was not immediately successful. Under Leslie Knighton, the club never finished better than ninth, and in 1923–24 came close to returning to the Second Division, finishing 19th and only a point clear of the relegation zone. Arsenal did no better the following season, finishing 20th (although paradoxically the club were a lot safer this time, being seven points clear of the relegation places), which was the last straw for Norris; he fired Knighton in May 1925, and appointed the Huddersfield Town manager, Herbert Chapman in his place.\n\nChapman reformed many of the club's practices, including modernising the training and physiotherapy regimes, adding numbers to the players' shirts in August 1928, and changing the team's colours, adding white sleeves to the red shirt in March 1933. Chapman also insisted on journalists dropping the definite article from the club's name, becoming just \"Arsenal\", and he successfully campaigned for the renaming of the local Tube station, Gillespie Road, to Arsenal. At the same time, Chapman had a large transfer budget by virtue of Arsenal's improved revenue from their new stadium and a change of heart from Henry Norris; previously a highly prudent chairman, Norris now dictated that there was to be heavy spending on new players. This led to Arsenal becoming known as the Bank of England club.\n\nChapman's first signing was veteran Charlie Buchan from Sunderland; as well as his contributions on the pitch, Buchan would play an important part off it. After Arsenal were beaten 7–0 by Newcastle United in October 1925, Buchan suggested a change to the formation to adapt to a relaxation of the offside law, adjusting Arsenal's formation to the \"WM\", strengthening the defence by pushing the centre half back into defence and the full-backs out to the wings. Over time, Chapman developed the formation further, putting an emphasis on a pacey forward line, wingers cutting inside, and the role of a creative ball-playing midfielder.\n\nArsenal came second in Chapman's first season, their best finish at that time, but this proved to be a false dawn; for the next few seasons they stayed in mid-table as Chapman took his time to assemble his side, slotting new signings such as winger Joe Hulme, forward Jack Lambert and defenders Tom Parker and Herbie Roberts into his new formation. In 1926–27, Arsenal reached their first FA Cup final, only to lose 1–0 to Cardiff City, after Arsenal's goalkeeper Dan Lewis let a harmless-looking shot slip through his arms and into the net; it was the only occasion in history that the FA Cup has been won by a club from outside England.\n\nChapman was not deterred, and continued to build his side, signing future captain Eddie Hapgood, as well as three of the club's great attacking players, David Jack, Alex James and Cliff Bastin; it was especially Alex James, Arsenal's playmaker in midfield, supplying the forward line and wingers, who became celebrated as the engine of the team. Three years after their first Cup final, in 1929–30, Arsenal reached Wembley again, this time up against Chapman's old club Huddersfield Town. The match was notable for being \"buzzed\" by the enormous German airship \"Graf Zeppelin\". Arsenal were not distracted from their task; they won 2–0 with goals from James and Lambert to bring home the club's first major trophy.\n\nOn 30 August 1930, Arsenal helped create a new attendance record of 28,723 at Blackpool's Bloomfield Road ground. They helped set it again over the next two seasons with crowds of 29,576 and 30,218.\n\nTheir FA Cup success was the first in a decade in which Arsenal were the dominant club in England. They won the First Division for the first time in 1930–31; Arsenal performed strongly in a free-scoring title race with Aston Villa, recording several heavy wins (including 7–1 against Blackpool, 7–2 v Leicester City, and 9–1 v Grimsby Town, which remains a club record for the top flight). Arsenal won the title with two games to spare, and finished the season having scored 127 league goals (another club record), though Aston Villa managed to score 128, which is still a record for the most goals in an English top flight season.\nThe following season, 1931–32, Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again, losing controversially to Newcastle United. Arsenal had led 1–0 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's equaliser came after a long ball had gone over the goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies; Allen scored again in the second half to win the match 2–1. Arsenal's pain was compounded by the fact that Everton had pipped them to the League title; a poor start to the 1931–32 campaign meant Arsenal played catch-up for most of the season, finishing two points adrift.\n\nArsenal bounced back the following season, winning their second League title. Arsenal had started the season weakly, but then went on a long winning run to catch up and then overtake fellow title challengers Aston Villa, whom they beat 5–0 at Highbury in April to clinch the title. By this time Chapman's first set of signings had started to show their age so with an eye to the future Chapman promoted George Male to the first team to replace Tom Parker, and signed Ray Bowden to take over from David Jack. The only blot on the club's record was an infamous loss to Walsall of the Third Division North in the FA Cup; five of the first team were out with injury or flu and had their place taken by reserves, and without them Arsenal lost 2–0 in one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all time. One of the stand-ins, Tommy Black, was particularly to blame (conceding a penalty for Walsall's second), and was sold by an enraged Chapman to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result; another, striker Charlie Walsh, was transferred to Brentford a week later.\n\nArsenal had started the 1933–34 season solidly, but in January 1934 Herbert Chapman died suddenly from pneumonia. Despite this, under caretaker manager Joe Shaw Arsenal retained the title that season; Hulme and James were both out with injury for a large portion, and so Arsenal were not the attacking side they had been the previous season, scoring only 75 in the League, compared with 118 in 1932–33.\n\nGeorge Allison (who had formerly been a director of the club) took over the job of team manager in summer 1934 and soon signed new blood for the side, including wing halves Jack Crayston and Wilf Copping (whose signings had been initiated by Chapman), and striker Ted Drake. With these new signings, Allison oversaw the completion of a hat-trick of League titles in 1934–35, and Arsenal were back to their attacking best; Drake scored a club record 42 league goals that season and Arsenal racked up a series of heavily one-sided scorelines reminiscent of the 1930–31 season (including 7–0 \"v.\" Wolves, 8–1 \"v.\" Liverpool, and 8–0 twice, \"v.\" Leicester City and \"v.\" Middlesbrough). Such was Arsenal's strength that in November 1934, seven players that started for the England side that beat World Champions Italy 3–2 (in the so-called \"Battle of Highbury\") were on Arsenal's books, a record number of players from a single club, which still stands today.\n\nArsenal's ongoing success attracted larger and larger crowds. Arsenal's home, Highbury, was completely redeveloped, with Leitch's stands from 1913 demolished and replaced with modern Art Deco stands, parts of which remain to this day — the façade of the East Stand is now a Grade II listed building, and both façades have been retained as part of the modern-day redevelopment of Highbury into an apartment complex. Meanwhile, the North Bank and Clock End terraces had roofs installed. The new stadium saw its largest attendance, 73,295, on 9 March 1935 for a match against Sunderland.\n\nArsenal's dominance of the decade was sealed with a second FA Cup in 1935–36, winning 1–0 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake. Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934–35 title, and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme. Nevertheless, they won a fifth League title in 1937–38, pipping Wolves on the final day of the season, to cap off a highly successful decade.\n\nSoon after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, all first-class football in Britain was suspended, and the 1939–40 Football League season annulled. Highbury was requisitioned as an ARP station, with a barrage balloon operating behind the Clock End. During the Blitz, a bomb fell on the North Bank, destroying the roof and setting fire to the scrap that was being stored on the terrace. With Highbury closed, Arsenal instead played their home matches at White Hart Lane, home of their rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Wartime matches do not count in official statistics; competitions were played on a regional basis and teams often did not complete a full season; many footballers served in the armed forces as trainers or instructors and were away from their clubs for long periods of time, so they would often star as \"guests\" at other clubs. Arsenal won the Football League War Cup South in 1942–43 and the London or Southern league titles in 1939–40, 1941–42 and 1942–43. Participation in the London League led to their expulsion from The Football League in 1941 along with 14 other clubs; it was not until April 1942 when they were readmitted after expressing regret and paying a £10 fine.\n\nIn November 1945, with league competition still suspended, Arsenal were one of the teams that played a Dynamo Moscow side touring the UK. With many players still serving abroad in the armed forces, Arsenal were severely depleted and used six guest players, including Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen, which led Dynamo to declare they were playing an England XI, although three of the side were actually Welsh. In any case, Dynamo themselves had Vsevolod Bobrov on loan from CDKA Moscow. The match, at White Hart Lane, kicked off in thick fog and the slick and technically proficient Dynamo won 4–3, after Arsenal had led 3–1 at half-time.\n\nThough the score is generally agreed upon, after that accounts of the match diverge; even the identity of the goalscorers is disputed. English reports alleged Dynamo fielded twelve players at one point, and tried to pressurise the referee into abandoning the match when they had been behind; in turn, the Soviets accused Arsenal of persistent foul play and even alleged George Allison had bet money on the result (a claim that was later retracted). The acrimony after the match was such that it inspired George Orwell to write his 1945 essay \"The Sporting Spirit\", in which he famously opined on the nature of sport, namely that in his view \"it is war minus the shooting\". With the fog obscuring much of the action, not to mention the language barriers and the early-Cold War mutual suspicion between both sides, it is unlikely any reliable account of the match will emerge.\n\nThe war had claimed the lives of nine Arsenal first team players, the most of any top flight club, and the intervening time had cut short the careers of several others, including Bastin and Drake. Additionally, the debts from the construction of Highbury and the costs of repairing war damage were a heavy financial burden, and Arsenal struggled at first when competitive football resumed in 1946. They lost 6–1 on aggregate to West Ham United in the third round of the 1945–46 FA Cup, and upon the league's resumption in 1946–47 the club finished 13th, their worst in 17 years. George Allison decided to retire from football at the end of that season, and was replaced by his assistant Tom Whittaker, a long-time servant of the club who had been trainer under Chapman.\n\nWhittaker enjoyed immediate success, winning the League title in 1947–48; led by captain Joe Mercer's strong defence and with goals from attacking front two of Reg Lewis and Ronnie Rooke, Arsenal were top of the table from October until the season's climax, winning by a seven-point margin. However, given the age of the Arsenal side at the time (Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty, as were Denis and Leslie Compton), long-term success was not possible. In response, Whittaker had brought in younger players such as Doug Lishman, Alex Forbes and Cliff Holton. Although Arsenal were unable to sustain any challenges for the League title, with the new blood they won the FA Cup in 1949–50, with Reg Lewis scoring both goals in a 2–0 win over Liverpool.\n\nThe 1951–52 season saw the club nearly win the Double, but ultimately end up empty-handed; a series of injuries and a fixture pile-up at the end of the season saw Arsenal lose their last two matches, including the title decider against eventual champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on the last day of the season; after losing 6–1, the Gunners finished third, equal on points with Tottenham. A week later, Arsenal played Newcastle United in the 1952 FA Cup Final, with several recovering players rushed back into the first team; Walley Barnes was taken off injured with a twisted knee after 35 minutes (no substitutes were allowed then), and ten-man Arsenal suffered further injuries to Holton, Roper and Daniel, so that by the end of the match they had only seven fit players on the pitch; with the numerical advantage in their favour, Newcastle won 1–0 with a goal from George Robledo.\n\nDespite the disappointment of the previous season, Arsenal won their seventh League title in 1952–53; in one of the closest title races, they beat Preston North End to the title on goal average after finishing level on points. The title looked to be Preston's after Arsenal lost to them 2–0 at Deepdale in the penultimate game of the season, but Arsenal came from behind to beat Burnley 3–2, to take the title on 0.099 of a goal. That proved to be Arsenal's last trophy for seventeen years, as Arsenal's fortunes began to wane, particularly after the unexpected death of Tom Whittaker in October 1956.\n\nAs the club's fortunes declined, they found themselves unable to attract many stars (Welsh international goalkeeper Jack Kelsey being a notable exception), while up and coming players such as David Herd left for more successful clubs. Jack Crayston and George Swindin, both former players, followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success. Apart from finishing third in 1958–59 and fifth in both 1955–56 and 1956–57, Arsenal usually finished in mid-table. Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup — after reaching the final in 1951–52, Arsenal would not get beyond the quarter-finals again until 1970–71. To make matters worse for the club, Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960–61.\n\nIn 1962, Arsenal made the bold but ultimately unsuccessful step of appointing former England and Wolves captain Billy Wright as manager, despite his lack of managerial experience and the fact he had no prior experience with the club. Like his two immediate predecessors, Wright was not very successful, although it was under his leadership that the club made their debut in European competition, in the 1963–64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after finishing seventh in 1962–63. In his final season, Arsenal finished 14th, their lowest position in 36 years, and recorded the lowest attendance at Highbury — 4,554 in a match against Leeds United on 5 May 1966. The only Arsenal player to figure in England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning squad was George Eastham, who did not play at all during the tournament. Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966, and was replaced by club physiotherapist Bertie Mee. Though the club's directors did not know it at the time, Mee would turn around the club and lead them to success both in Europe and at home within the next five years.\n\n\n", "id": "7732020", "categories": ["Arsenal F.C."], "title": "History of Arsenal F.C.

It is one of the oldest Jewish summer camps in the United States.\n\nFounded in 1901 by the Educational Alliance as a camp for Jewish boys from the tenements of Manhattan's Lower East Side around the lake that Breakneck Brook rises from, it incorporated as Surprise Lake Camp in 1902. In 1911 the 92nd Street Y joined in the operation of the camp, and in 1917 the camp became an independent agency within the newly formed Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. The camp continues to operate as a summer camp for children from the New York metropolitan area. In 2005, the camp sold 200 acres and granted a conservation easement over an additional 465 acres of camp property to the Open Space Institute, thus ensuring the preservation of these undeveloped lands adjacent to Hudson Highlands State Park. The camp was the setting of a popular 2013 viral video on the topic of feminine hygiene entitled \"Camp Gyno\".\n\nIn its early years of operation, the camp was subjected to antisemitic demonstrations of cross burning by local members of the Ku Klux Klan, but the camp developed a better relationship with the surrounding residents over time. For its campers who came from immigrant homes, many of them Yiddish-speaking, the camp emphasized acculturation to mainstream American styles of speech and appearance. Surprise Lake Camp is part of a large-scale archival project directed by YIVO (the Institute for Jewish Research) with the goal of preserving the historical record of the Jews of New York City.\n\nAmong Surprise Lake's first campers was Eddie Cantor, who credited his youthful performances at Surprise Lake Camp (also depicted in the 1953 biopic \"The Eddie Cantor Story\") with giving him the encouragement to pursue show business. Upon achieving success as an entertainer, he became one of the camp's most ardent supporters. He was a member of the Surprise Lake Camp Board of Directors, and a theater at the camp was named for him.\n\nOther notable Surprise Lake campers have included Neil Diamond (who has identified Pete Seeger's visits to the camp as his earliest exposure to a musical role model), Jax, Joseph Heller, Jerry Stiller, Gene Simmons, Larry King, Neil Simon, Cody Brotter, and Walter Matthau.\n\n", "id": "7732024", "categories": ["Youth organizations based in New York (state)", "Jewish summer camps in New York (state)"], "title": "Surprise Lake Camp"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7732042", "text": "History of Arsenal F.C. (1966–present)\n\nThe history of Arsenal Football Club from 1966 to the present day covers the third, fourth, and fifth periods of success in Arsenal's history, including three Doubles, a Cup Double, and success in European football.\n\nFollowing Bertie Mee's appointment in 1966, Arsenal won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, their first European trophy, in 1969–70, and their first League and FA Cup double in 1970–71. The Double-winning side, however, was soon broken up and the following decade was characterised by a series of near misses: Arsenal lost three FA Cup finals (1971–72, 1977–78, and 1979–80) and the 1979–80 Cup Winners' Cup final on penalties. The club's only success during this time was an FA Cup win in 1978–79 against Manchester United.\n\nAfter stagnation in the 1980s, the return of former player George Graham as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory. Arsenal won the League Cup in 1986–87, the Football League Centenary Trophy in 1988, two League title wins in 1988–89 and 1990–91, the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1992–93 and a second European trophy, the Cup Winners' Cup, in 1993–94. However, Graham's reputation was tarnished when it was revealed that he had taken kickbacks for signing certain players and he was sacked in 1995.\n\nArsenal fifth period of success came with the appointment of Arsène Wenger in 1996. Under him, Arsenal won a second league and cup double in 1997–98 and then a third in 2001–02. In addition, the club were victorious in the 2002–03 and 2004–05 FA Cups, and won the Premier League in 2003–04 without losing a single match. In 2005–06 became the first London club to reach the UEFA Champions League Final, and lost 2–1 against FC Barcelona. During the following close season, they left their longstanding home of Highbury to the new Emirates Stadium nearby.Their new home would unfortunately see a trophy drought for the next seven years.The Emirates Stadium would have something to celebrate as Arsenal would win 3 FA Cups for the next four seasons.\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Billy Wright in the summer of 1966, Arsenal appointed physiotherapist Bertie Mee as his successor. The move that brought surprise to some, not least Mee himself, who requested that he be able to return to his old role as physio if being manager had not worked out after 12 months. With assistant Dave Sexton, Mee brought a more professional approach to the club and promoted talent from within; Arsenal's youth team had won the FA Youth Cup in 1966, and talented attacking players such as Charlie George, John Radford, Peter Simpson and Ray Kennedy graduated to the first team.\n\nMee complemented this attacking ability with some more experienced heads; captain Frank McLintock at centre half marshalled a strong defence, while the hard-tackling Peter Storey filled the defensive midfield position. The team showed early signs of promise, reaching two successive League Cup finals, in 1968 and 1969. Both times the Gunners went home empty-handed. The first time Arsenal lost to Don Revie's Leeds United 1–0 in a dour match of few chances, Terry Cooper grabbing the only goal.\n\nThe second League Cup loss was an infamous upset – Arsenal lost 3–1 to Third Division side Swindon Town. Eight of the team had been struck by flu that had led to the postponement of Arsenal's previous League fixture, and Arsenal had only reached extra time thanks to a late goalkeeping error that had allowed Bobby Gould to score. In extra time, Don Rogers scored twice as Arsenal searched for a winner. However, that season was not a total disaster for Arsenal; they had also finished fourth, which won them a place in Europe for the 1969–70 season.\n\nIn turn, this led to the club collecting their first silverware in seventeen years and also their first European trophy, the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Arsenal beat Ajax 3-1 on aggregate in the semi-finals, and then staged a famous comeback against Anderlecht in the final. Arsenal were 3-0 down after 74 minutes of the first leg at Stade Émile Versé, but Ray Kennedy got a late away goal to give the Gunners a glimmer of hope; in the second leg in front of a packed Highbury, inspired by captain Frank McLintock, Arsenal won 3-0 with goals from John Radford, Eddie Kelly and Jon Sammels, to win the tie 4-3 on aggregate.\n\nThe same season, Arsenal had only finished 12th in the league, perhaps distracted by their European campaign, and did not look like league contenders. Yet the following season, 1970–71, Arsenal went on to become only the second club of the 20th century to win the FA Cup and League Double, the club's first. After a bright start Arsenal looked to be out of the title chase with a 5–0 loss to Stoke City in September. However, Arsenal recovered and put in a strong run (they did not lose again in the league until January), and as the season closed they became involved in a tight race with Leeds United.\n\nArsenal were pushed all the way – after being defeated 1–0 by Leeds in April, they needed to beat or draw 0–0 with North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on the last day of the season to take the title on goal average. An 87th-minute goal by Ray Kennedy gave Arsenal a 1–0 lead and despite Spurs' desperate attempts for an equaliser Arsenal hung on to win and take the title. In the meantime, Arsenal had also reached the FA Cup Final, following a titanic semi-final battle with Stoke which saw them come from 2–0 down to force a replay and eventual victory. In the Final, five days after the win at Tottenham, Arsenal beat Liverpool 2–1 at Wembley; Arsenal went 1–0 down early in extra time, before Eddie Kelly's 101st-minute equaliser from close range. Ten minutes later, Charlie George scored the winner from the edge of the penalty area to win the game, and the Double, for Arsenal.\n\nThe Double proved to be a premature high point of a decade characterised by a string of near-misses. Despite signing World Cup winner Alan Ball for a club record £220,000 in the close season, Arsenal began 1971–72 badly, losing three matches in August, and were forced to play catch-up for the rest of the season, ultimately finishing fifth. Their debut in the European Cup started encouragingly, but they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by a Johann Cruyff-inspired Ajax, who went on to win the trophy as part of a hat-trick of European titles. Arsenal also reached the FA Cup Final for the second year in a row; in a repeat of the 1968 League Cup Final they lost 1–0 to Leeds United, in an ugly match of few real chances.\n\nArsenal finished as First Division runners-up in 1972–73, but within a year the Double-winning side had been broken up, and Mee was unable to build a new team in its place. The club's form declined sharply, finishing 16th in 1974–75 and 17th in 1975–76, their lowest in more than forty years, which prompted Mee's resignation. Tottenham manager Terry Neill, a former Arsenal player, was appointed in his place, even though he had never got Spurs anywhere beyond mid-table, to become Arsenal's youngest-ever manager.\n\nWorst team Arsenal moved back into the top half of the table, inspired in part by the emergence of Irish superstar Liam Brady. Brady formed part of a large Irish contingent at Highbury, which included Pat Rice, Frank Stapleton, Pat Jennings Sammy Nelson, John Devine and the young David O'Leary. Further to this were experienced signings such as Malcolm Macdonald and Alan Hudson, as well as the return of Don Howe, who had been part of the backroom staff when the Double was won, to the Arsenal coaching setup.\n\nAlthough they could not challenge the League dominance of Liverpool at the time, towards the end of the decade they proved their mettle in the FA Cup. Arsenal reached three finals in a row (1978, 1979, and 1980), but won only one, the 1979 final against Manchester United. Largely inspired by Brady, Arsenal went 2–0 up through Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton and looked to be coasting to victory; with five minutes to go, United scored twice in quick succession to level the match. Extra time loomed, but Alan Sunderland converted Graham Rix's cross in injury time to secure a famous 3–2 win.\n\nThe next season, 1979–80, proved to be cruel as Arsenal played a record-breaking 70 matches and reached two cup finals, only to end the season empty-handed. Arsenal were favourites to beat Second Division West Ham United in the FA Cup final, but lost 1–0 to a Trevor Brooking header. Meanwhile, they had also reached the Cup Winners' Cup final against Valencia, after Paul Vaessen's goal had given them a famous victory over Juventus in the semi-finals; the final finished goalless and Arsenal lost on penalties, with Brady and Rix having their efforts saved.\n\nLiam Brady left Arsenal for Juventus in the summer of 1980, and the team entered another barren spell. They continued to finish in the top four at the start of the 1980s, but never really looked like winning the title, and they could not rediscover their FA Cup form either – aside from 1982–83 when Arsenal reached both cup semi-finals in only to be knocked out in both by Manchester United. Neill struggled to control his team at times; throughout his tenure, he had fallings-out with many of his players (including Hudson and Macdonald) and he was unable to contain the drinking culture within the squad. His signings to replace the departed Brady and Stapleton failed to make the same impact, and towards the end of Neill's reign the club suffered several embarrassing cup defeats; this included losing to part-timers K.F.C. Winterslag in the 1981–82 UEFA Cup and Third Division Walsall in the 1983–84 League Cup. Neill was sacked in December 1983, soon after the latter result.\n\nDon Howe, Neill's assistant, succeeded him but he could not get the side anywhere near a trophy either. Although Arsenal managed to finish sixth and seventh under him, they never seriously challenged for the title (although they did briefly top the league in October 1984) and were dumped out of the 1984–85 FA Cup by Third Division York City. The fans were getting increasingly disillusioned with the club's muddling performances and attendances started to dip beneath 20,000. In March 1986, after hearing the board had approached FC Barcelona coach Terry Venables as his replacement, Howe resigned. Steve Burtenshaw was briefly caretaker manager but the club decided to look to outside for Howe's long-term successor.\n\nThe Arsenal board of directors did contact Scottish club Aberdeen with a view to offering the job to their manager Alex Ferguson (while also drawing up an offer to Millwall manager George Graham to become assistant manager of Arsenal), but Ferguson rejected the offer. However, Ferguson did cross the border six months later to succeed Ron Atkinson at Manchester United.\n\nIn May 1986, Millwall manager George Graham, a former Arsenal player, was appointed as Howe's long-term replacement, and it was the beginning of a new era of success at Highbury. Graham gradually sold off most of the older players and replaced them with new signings and players promoted from the youth team, while imposing much stricter discipline than his predecessors, both in the dressing room and on the pitch. Arsenal's form immediately improved, so much so that the club were top of the League at Christmas 1986.\n\nPlayers like Kenny Sansom, Steve Williams, Tommy Caton, Charlie Nicholas and Gus Caesar were gradually discarded and a new-look Arsenal side featured players including Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn, Steve Bould, David Rocastle, Alan Smith and Paul Merson.\n\nThough Arsenal finished fourth in Graham's first season in charge (having led the First Division for most of the winter), Arsenal did win the League Cup, in a campaign marked by comebacks. Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-finals; after losing 1–0 at Highbury in the first leg and conceding a second goal in the first half of the second leg at White Hart Lane, Arsenal scored twice through Viv Anderson and Niall Quinn to draw 2–2 on aggregate and force a replay; in the replay Spurs went 1–0 up, only for Arsenal to come back again with late goals from Ian Allinson and David Rocastle to win. The final against Liverpool was a repeat performance; after Arsenal had gone 1–0 down to an Ian Rush goal, two Charlie Nicholas goals brought Arsenal their first League Cup triumph and their first major trophy for eight years. However, UEFA voted to continue the ban on English clubs in European competitions that was imposed in the wake of the Heysel disaster in 1985 for a third season, and this meant that Arsenal were unable to compete in the 1987–88 UEFA Cup.\n\nWhile Arsenal lost the League Cup final the following year in a shock 3–2 defeat to Luton Town and dipped to sixth place in the league, their League form steadily improved afterwards, thanks largely to a revamped defence which consisted of Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn, Steve Bould and Tony Adams, which formed the basis of Arsenal's successes for a decade or more. Until he left in 1993, long-serving defender David O'Leary remained an important member of the squad who frequently appeared as a substitute and filled in whenever the younger members of the back four were unavailable. However, during this time Graham's Arsenal were not a purely defensive side; Graham also employed capable midfielders such as David Rocastle, Michael Thomas and Paul Merson, and striker Alan Smith, whose prolific goalscoring regularly brought him more than 20 goals in most of the eight seasons he spent at the club.\n\nIn Graham's third season (1988–89), the club won the Football League Centenary Trophy before winning their first League title since 1971, in highly dramatic fashion. Having led the League since Christmas, Arsenal were overtaken by Liverpool after losing to Derby County and drawing at home to Wimbledon in May. Arsenal had seemingly thrown away the title, but the final game of the season, on 26 May, was against Liverpool at Anfield; Arsenal needed to win by two goals to take the title; Liverpool had already won the FA Cup and were favourites to complete the Double. Alan Smith scored for Arsenal early in the second half to make it 1–0, but as time ticked by Arsenal struggled to get a second, and with 90 minutes gone on the clock, Arsenal still needed another goal and it looked as though the league title would be staying at Anfield. But, with only seconds to go, a Smith flick-on found Michael Thomas surging through the Liverpool defence; the young midfielder lifted the ball over Bruce Grobbelaar and into the net, giving Arsenal the title.\n\nArsenal did not retain the title the following season; they finished fourth in 1989–90 and fell behind champions Liverpool, runners-up Aston Villa and third-placed Tottenham Hotspur in the title challenge. They also failed to make their mark in the cups, and the post-Heysel ban on English clubs in European competition was still in force at that time, so Arsenal were unable to represent England in the European Cup. The ban was lifted at the end of the season, though Liverpool (the team present at the Heysel disaster) had to serve an extra year.\n\nGraham prepared for another title challenge by signing goalkeeper David Seaman and Swedish winger Anders Limpar in the summer of 1990; both players proved vital as Arsenal retook the title in 1990–91, despite two major setbacks. Arsenal had two points deducted in November 1990 after ten of their players were involved in a brawl with Manchester United players in a match at Old Trafford, and captain Tony Adams was sentenced to four months' imprisonment for drink driving just before Christmas. Despite these setbacks, Arsenal lost only one league match all season and finished seven points clear of Liverpool at the end of what had for most of the season been a two-horse race for the title. They also reached the FA Cup semi-finals, where they faced Tottenham Hotspur; Paul Gascoigne scored with a free kick from 30 yards after just five minutes and Tottenham ran home 3–1 winners, dashing hopes of a unique second Double.\n\nIn September 1991, Arsenal paid a club record of £2.5million for Crystal Palace striker Ian Wright, who would go on to spend seven years at the club and become their all-time leading goalscorer in the process. The 1991–92 season saw the club's first entry in the European Cup for 20 years. The European venture went badly; Arsenal were knocked out by Benfica in the second round and failed to make the lucrative group stage. The season went from bad to worse when the Gunners were knocked out of the FA Cup by lowly Wrexham, though Arsenal recovered to finish fourth in the League. The ban on English clubs in European competitions had been lifted two years earlier, but Arsenal missed out on a UEFA Cup place as English clubs were gradually being phased back into European competitions and at this stage only the second and third placed teams were qualifying for the UEFA Cup.\n\nDuring the 1992 close season the club acquired Danish midfielder John Jensen, who had just won Euro 92 with Denmark, scoring a goal in their victory over Germany in the final. Jensen's arrival coincided with the departure of fellow midfielder David Rocastle to Leeds United, the defending league champions. Around this point, Graham altered his tactics; he became more defensive and turned out far less attack-minded sides, which depended mainly on goals from Wright rather than the whole team. Between 1986–87 and 1991–92 Arsenal averaged 66 League goals a season (scoring 81 in 1991–92), but between 1992–93 and 1994–95 they only averaged 48; this included just 40 in 1992–93, when the club finished 10th in the inaugural season of the FA Premier League, scoring fewer than any other team in the division, though they had briefly topped the table in November.\n\nThey were founder members of the FA Premier League on its launch for the 1992–93 season. They lost their first ever Premiership game 4-2 after taking a 2–0 lead over underdogs Norwich City at Highbury; Norwich, among the pre-season relegation favourites, were actively involved in the title race and finished third, whereas Arsenal (among the pre-season title favourites) finished 10th.\n\nArsenal's form in the cups was much better than in the league, and in 1992–93 they became the first side to win the FA Cup and League Cup double. In the League Cup final, Arsenal faced Sheffield Wednesday; a Merson-inspired Arsenal side came from 1–0 down to win 2–1 thanks to a Steve Morrow goal. In the FA Cup, Arsenal beat Spurs 1–0 in the semi-finals (avenging their defeat of 1991), and played Sheffield Wednesday in the final, just as they had done in the League Cup final a few weeks earlier. The game ended 1–1 and went to a replay; Wright opened the scoring for Arsenal but Chris Waddle equalised. Extra time came, and still no goal broke the deadlock until the 120th minute, when Andy Linighan powered home a header from a corner to win the match and the cup double for Arsenal.\n\nIn 1993–94, Arsenal won their second European trophy; a side missing key players (John Jensen and Martin Keown were injured, while Ian Wright was suspended), beat favourites and holders Parma 1–0 in the Cup Winners' Cup final in Copenhagen, with a tight defensive performance and Alan Smith's 21st-minute goal from a left foot volley. The 1994 Cup Winners' Cup proved to be George Graham's last trophy at the club; the following February the Scot was sacked after nearly nine years in charge, after it was discovered he had accepted an illegal £425,000 payment from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge following Arsenal's 1992 acquisition of John Jensen, one of Hauge's clients.\n\nIn the weeks before Graham was sacked, he made three major signings for Arsenal. Glenn Helder, a Dutch winger signed from Vitesse, was a regular first-team player for more than a year after joining the club but was then loaned to Benfica before permanently departing in October 1997 to join NAC Breda back in the Netherlands. Chris Kiwomya, an attacking midfielder signed from Ipswich Town, scored 3 goals in 17 matches before the end of the season but never played for the club again, finally departing in 1998 to sign for Queens Park Rangers. Nineteen-year-old Welsh striker John Hartson was signed from Luton Town and occupied the first-team place vacated by the injury-hit Alan Smith, who retired from playing months later. However, Hartson was not a regular player the following season and was sold to West Ham United in 1997.\n\nGeorge Graham's final season at Arsenal was also the final season at the club for several of the club's key players. Alan Smith, one of his first signings, was forced into retirement by injury several months later. Paul Davis, the club's longest-serving player, was given a free transfer at the season's end, having found his first team opportunities increasingly limited towards the end of his time at Arsenal. Swedish midfielder Stefan Schwarz was sold to Fiorentina that summer after just one season at Highbury. Striker Kevin Campbell, who had struggled to establish himself as a regular player in spite of some impressive performances over five seasons, was sold to Nottingham Forest. Winger Jimmy Carter, who had failed to establish himself as a regular player in four seasons at Arsenal, was sold to Portsmouth.\n\nAssistant manager Stewart Houston took charge until the end of the 1994–95 season. Arsenal finished 12th in the Premier League. However, they did reach the Cup Winners' Cup final again, after a titanic semi-final against Sampdoria, which they won on penalties after drawing 5–5 on aggregate. Arsenal faced Real Zaragoza in the final; Esnáider scored for the Spaniards and John Hartson equalised for Arsenal. The game was heading to a 1–1 draw and penalties, before midfielder Nayim struck from 40 yards in the 120th minute, in virtually the last kick of the game. David Seaman, who had been Arsenal's hero in the semi-final shootout, could not backpedal fast enough and only got a hand to the ball as it went in.\n\nIn June 1995, Arsenal appointed Bruce Rioch, who had just guided Bolton Wanderers to the League Cup final and promotion to the top flight, as manager. He (briefly) broke the English transfer record by paying Internazionale £7.5 million for Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp, and the new signing formed an impressive partnership with Ian Wright. Arsenal reached the League Cup semi-finals and finished fifth in the Premiership at the end of 1995–96, securing a place in the following season's UEFA Cup and giving hope for an eventual title challenge. However, the Rioch era ended abruptly: in August 1996, just before the start of the new season, Rioch was sacked after a dispute over transfer funds with the board of directors, triggering a couple of months' turmoil at the club. Stewart Houston was once again put in temporary charge; he remained at the helm for a month, before resigning to take over at QPR. Youth team coach Pat Rice held the fort for several games, before making way for the Frenchman Arsène Wenger at the end of September.\n\nThe team immediately improved under Wenger's management, coming third and winning a UEFA Cup place in 1996–97, missing out on second (and a Champions League spot) on goal difference. Wenger rebuilt the Arsenal squad with a crop of French players who were largely unknown in the UK. Patrick Vieira had been signed on Wenger's recommendation before he had officially taken up the reins, and Wenger added Nicolas Anelka and Emmanuel Petit, as well as Dutch winger Marc Overmars in the summer of 1997. Wenger melded the new arrivals with some of the \"old guard\", retaining Adams, Dixon, Winterburn, Keown and Bould, and he kept Pat Rice on as assistant manager.\n\nWenger got his first silverware, and became the first foreign manager to win the English league, the following season, when he steered the side to their second double. It had looked like Arsenal were out of the title race by December after losing 3–1 at home to Blackburn, but they overcame a twelve-point deficit to overtake Manchester United; a 4–0 home win over Everton on 3 May won the title with two matches to spare. On 16 May, Arsenal beat Newcastle United 2–0 in the FA Cup final to complete the double. To top it off, the same season Ian Wright broke Cliff Bastin's goalscoring record, bringing his tally to 185 goals before leaving the club in the summer of 1998.\n\nDespite the signing of Freddie Ljungberg in 1998 and Thierry Henry a year later, a more barren period followed for Arsenal over the next few years, though they came close several times. Arsenal led the League for much of 1998–99, until a 1–0 loss to Leeds United allowed Manchester United to overtake them; Arsenal beat Aston Villa on the last day of the season but United's victory over Spurs meant they took the title. To rub it in further, Arsenal also lost the last ever FA Cup semi-final replay to Manchester United; Dennis Bergkamp had missed a penalty in normal time, and Ryan Giggs scored the winner in extra time after a mazy solo run through the Arsenal defence. Arsenal's return to the Champions League for the first time in seven years was also unsuccessful, as they failed to get past the group stage.\n\nArsenal came second again in 1999–2000; this time, there was never any real title race and Arsenal finished the season 18 points behind winners Manchester United. Arsenal had another poor season in the Champions League, finishing third in their group; this won them a consolation place in the UEFA Cup, and Arsenal got all the way to the final, where they faced Galatasaray in Copenhagen, the scene of their 1994 Cup Winners' Cup triumph. The match was a tepid affair, a 0–0 draw with few chances; it went to penalties and Arsenal lost after Davor Šuker and Patrick Vieira missed their spot-kicks.\n\nArsenal again finished second in 2000–01, this time ten points behind Manchester United; the title race had been as good as over since February, when Arsenal lost 6–1 at Old Trafford. Arsenal's season gave priority to the Cups and Europe. They beat Spurs in the semi-finals and met Liverpool in the final at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff; Arsenal dominated most of the match, and were denied a goal by the arm of defender Stéphane Henchoz, which went unpunished. Arsenal finally did go 1–0 up through Ljungberg but succumbed to two late Michael Owen goals and lost 2–1. In Europe, Arsenal made it to the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 1972, only to be eliminated on the away goals rule by eventual finalists Valencia.\n\nBy now, Wenger had been forced to rebuild much of the Double-winning side of 1998; Anelka, Overmars and Petit had all left for Spanish clubs in return for hefty fees, while age was finally catching up with the famous back line; Bould and Winterburn had already left, and Adams and Dixon would only last another season before retiring. In their place, Wenger signed the likes of Sol Campbell and Lauren in defence, as well as promoting Ashley Cole from the youth ranks. In midfield, Wenger added the talismanic Robert Pires and signed his compatriot Sylvain Wiltord in attack, while in the meantime Thierry Henry had adapted to the English game to become one of the Premiership's best strikers.\n\nAttack was definitely Arsenal's forté as they won a record-equalling third Double in 2001–02 season; the Gunners were the only team to score in every game of the Premiership season, and went unbeaten in domestic away games. After an initially tight title race (just three points separated the top four in February), Arsenal pulled away from the pack with a 13-game winning streak, finishing seven points ahead of runners-up Liverpool. Arsenal secured the title in the penultimate match of the season with a 1–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, the goal coming from Wiltord. The previous weekend, Arsenal had wrapped up their eighth FA Cup, beating Chelsea 2–0 with goals from Ray Parlour and Freddie Ljungberg.\n\nIn 2002–03, Arsenal became the first club in more than 20 years to retain the FA Cup, with a 1–0 victory against Southampton thanks to a Pires goal. Their joy was soured by the fact that they narrowly missed out on retaining the Premiership title. Arsenal had led eventual winners Manchester United by eight points at one stage, but their form collapsed late on in the season; they drew 2–2 away to Bolton Wanderers after leading 2–0, and then lost 3–2 at home to Leeds United a week later, which gave United the title.\n\nLittle did they know it at the time, but the defeat to Leeds would be Arsenal's last in the League for over a year. 2003–04 was a record-breaking season for Arsenal, as they won the Premiership unbeaten (26 wins, 12 draws, 0 defeats), finishing a clear 11 points ahead of second-place Chelsea. They became only the second team to do so, the first having been Preston North End in 1888–89. Their rivals for the title gained revenge in other competitions – Arsenal were defeated in the Champions League quarter-finals and FA Cup semi-finals by Chelsea and Manchester United, respectively, in successive matches. Faced with the potential collapse of their season, Arsenal recovered from being 1–0 and 2–1 behind to Liverpool in their next league match to win 4–2, thanks to a Thierry Henry hat-trick, and went on to win the league with a 2–2 draw away to Tottenham Hotspur, mimicking their success in 1971.\n\nArsenal were unable to retain the title in 2004–05, finishing second, 12 points behind a record-breaking Chelsea side. However, the Gunners did stretch their unbeaten run to 49 consecutive matches, an English league football record; the record was equalled with a dramatic 5–3 win over Middlesbrough (Arsenal having trailed 3–1 shortly after half-time) and then surpassed with a 3–0 win over Blackburn Rovers in August 2004, before their unbeaten season was ended with a 2–0 away defeat by Manchester United. This defeat arguably upset the team's form and they fell away from title contention before recovering with a late flourish to finish second, sealed with a 7–0 drubbing of Everton. Champions League glory eluded them again, with the club getting knocked out 3–2 on aggregate by Bayern Munich in the second round. Arsenal did not end the season empty-handed; they came away with their third FA Cup in four years, winning 5–4 on penalties after a 0–0 draw where they played ten versus eleven against Manchester United.\n\nWeakened by the sale of captain Patrick Vieira to Juventus in the summer of 2005, Arsenal's 2005–06 season was comparatively disappointing domestically and the club failed to challenge for any trophies at home. In the league, their poor away form dogged them and despite recording some impressive wins at home (5–0 over Aston Villa, and 7–0 over Middlesbrough), Arsenal spent much of the latter stages of the season in fifth place or lower, and looked set to miss out on the Champions League for the first time since 1997. However, they won their last three matches of the season, culminating in a 4–2 victory over Wigan Athletic in the last ever match at Highbury; coupled with Tottenham Hotspur's loss at West Ham the same day, this meant Arsenal pipped Spurs to fourth place and a Champions League spot.\n\nIn contrast to their domestic form, Arsenal's form in Europe in 2005–06 was much stronger; they reached the UEFA Champions League final for the first time in their history, becoming the first London club ever to do so. Arsenal finished top of their group unbeaten, above Ajax, Thun and Sparta Prague against whom Thierry Henry scored two goals on away to become the all-time record goalscorer for Arsenal; in the knockout stages they beat Real Madrid (becoming the first British team to beat Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium), Juventus and then Villarreal to reach the final, setting a competition record of ten matches without conceding a goal in the process. In the final, against Barcelona, Arsenal were reduced to ten men early on when goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off for a professional foul; nevertheless they were the ones who scored first, Sol Campbell scoring with a header from a free kick in the 37th minute. Arsenal desperately defended their lead, but two late goals from Samuel Eto'o and Juliano Belletti meant Barcelona ran out 2–1 winners.\n\nArsenal have been highly successful in the 1990s and 2000s, but Highbury's capacity was limited to only 38,500 in the post-Taylor report era; virtually every match was sold out and the club were unable to maximise matchday revenue. With expansion of Highbury ruled impossible, in 1999, Arsenal announced plans to move to nearby Ashburton Grove; construction started in December 2002 with the demolition of buildings on the site, and in July 2006, the new Emirates Stadium opened, ready for the start of the 2006–07 season.\n\nArsenal took a little time to get used to their new surroundings and as early as November, manager Arsène Wenger conceded that his side was unlikely to make a serious challenge for the title. Dogged by poor away form throughout the season, Arsenal eventually finished fourth, level on points with third-placed Liverpool. With a team largely filled with reserve and younger players, they reached the League Cup Final, which they lost 2–1 to Chelsea. They were less successful in other competitions, however, being knocked out early on in both the Champions League and FA Cup.\n\n2006–07 marked a transitional period — Arsenal had sold a string of key players, including Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, Lauren, Freddie Ljungberg, and most significantly, all-time top scorer and club captain Thierry Henry to Barcelona. Arsenal went into 2007–08 season with only four players from the title-winning season in 2003–04, with the likes of Cesc Fàbregas and Gaël Clichy establishing their places in the side.\n\nArsenal started the season strongly, going undefeated until early December, and in the process, setting a club record of 28 matches unbeaten in all competitions. The young squad continued to impress into the new year, with Emmanuel Adebayor in excellent scoring form. But Eduardo, a player of growing importance to the club, suffered a horrific injury at St Andrew's in Birmingham City and the game subsequently ended 2–2. The team were rocked and, inevitably, Arsenal slumped in the spring, eventually finishing third. They had little success in the cups, knocked out of the Champions League by Liverpool in the quarter-finals and the FA Cup by Manchester United. The League Cup was more fruitful, where Arsenal reached the semi-finals for a third season in a row, before being knocked out 6–2 on aggregate by Tottenham Hotspur, their first defeat in a North London derby in almost nine years.\n\nArsenal's 2008–09 season started well, reaching top of the table by late September. After that, the team lost momentum, with three defeats in November, and had dropped out of the top four by Christmas, despite victories over Manchester United and Chelsea. Arsenal continued to drop points in the league in the New Year, but eventually overtook Aston Villa to regain fourth place by mid-March, eventually finishing nine points clear. Arsenal also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing to Chelsea 2–1 in their first game at the new Wembley Stadium. In Europe, they finished second in their group and beat Roma and Villarreal before losing 4–1 on aggregate to Manchester United in the semi-finals.\n\nDespite being written off by much of the media going into the 2009–10 season, Arsenal made a bright start in the Premier League, aided by a new attacking formation and added defensive steel, in the form of holding midfielder Alex Song of Cameroon and new signing Thomas Vermaelen of Belgium. Arsenal's title challenge looked set to end in late November, following losses to Chelsea, Manchester United, and Manchester City, but an impressive run of games in December, aided by Chelsea and Manchester United both dropping points, restored momentum to Arsenal's title challenge going into 2010. In December, Arsenal were eliminated from the League Cup at the quarter-final stage by Manchester City.\n\nAfter being written out of the title race once in the 2009–10 Premier League season by pundits, Arsenal headed into a tough period of matches from 27 January through 10 February, in which they faced Aston Villa, Manchester United, Chelsea, and Liverpool all in a row. After losing to Stoke City in the FA Cup 3–1, Arsenal drew Aston Villa 0–0, got thrashed 3–1 at home by Manchester United, and lost at Chelsea 2–0. At the time, it left Arsenal nine points behind league leaders Chelsea. Again, Arsenal were written off in their title hopes, only for it to be resurrected once again, after Chelsea lost to Everton 2–1, Manchester City 4–2, and drew with Blackburn Rovers 1–1. Meanwhile, Manchester United also dropped points, drawing with Aston Villa 1–1 and also losing to Everton 3–1. Following Arsenal's 2–0 loss to Chelsea on 7 February, Arsenal went on a good run, winning all of their league games up to 20 March. However, on 27 February, a major injury to Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey occurred; it was eerily reminiscent of Eduardo's injury against Birmingham City on 23 February. However, whereas Arsenal drew against Birmingham that year 2–2 following a penalty call against Gaël Clichy in injury time (in which James McFadden converted the penalty and left then-captain William Gallas kicking at an advertisement board and in tears) and questioned Arsenal's fragile team mentality, Arsenal managed to rally against Stoke 3–1, having scored a penalty from captain Cesc Fàbregas in the 90th minute, and defender Thomas Vermaelen scoring a third in injury time. As of 25 March, Arsenal are in third place with 67 points, two points behind league leaders Manchester United with 31 games played.\n\nArsenal's Champions League match against Porto in the first leg went poorly. Played at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto on 17 February 2010, the first goal was scored by Porto: in the 11th minute of the match, stand-in goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański (for the injured Manuel Almunia) pushed a cross from Silvestre Varela into his own net, resulting in a quick 1–0 lead for Porto. However, in the 18th minute, Sol Campbell, making his first Champions League appearance for Arsenal since the 2006 Champions League final, scored a header from Vermaelen's headed flick and Tomáš Rosický's headed setup from a corner delivered by Fàbregas. This gave Arsenal a possibly vital away goal. However, the match got worse for Arsenal as miscommunication by Campbell and Fabiański led to the goalkeeper picking up what was judged a deliberate back pass to the goal keeper inside the 18-yard box. As a result, the referee gave a free-kick to Porto inside Arsenal's penalty area. Rúben Micael took the resulting quick free-kick directly, catching the Arsenal defence and goalkeeper off-guard and squared a pass to Radamel Falcao, who easily scored. The game match 2–1 for Porto.\n\nArsenal's second leg against Porto fared much better. Played at the Emirates Stadium on 9 March, Arsenal needed at least one goal and a clean sheet to advance, with the aggregate score 2–1 for Porto and away aggregate 1–0 for Arsenal. The match began brightly for Arsenal, as Nicklas Bendtner scored in the 10th and 25th minute, before Samir Nasri scored a fantastic goal in the 66th minute, dribbling past three defenders on the far right side touchline before scoring from an acute angle, hitting the goalkeeper's right post and into the net. Three minutes later, Emmanuel Eboué scored on a counter-attack, dribbling past goalkeeper Helton before tucking the ball into an empty net. The night ended with Bendtner scoring a penalty in the 90th minute, thus giving him his first senior professional hat-trick, and Arsenal advancing to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, 6–2 on aggregate. Bendtner had missed a number of easy chances the match before Porto against Burnley. However, Arsenal managed to win 3–1 in that match.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, Arsenal drew Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals. The first of the two-legged match was played on 31 March at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium; it marked Thierry Henry's return to the Emirates for the first time as an opponent of Arsenal. The second leg was played on 6 April at the Camp Nou and marked Cesc Fàbregas' return to the Catalan giants, where he played in their youth squad. If Arsenal prevailed past Barcelona, they would face the winner of the CSKA Moscow–Internazionale match. In their first leg match at Emirates, Arsenal drew 2–2 with Barça, with goals from Theo Walcott and captain Fàbregas. The second leg at the Camp Nou did not go as well, despite Bendtner scoring early on. Lionel Messi scored an four goals to end the match at an aggregate score of 6–3 for Barcelona, eliminating Arsenal from the Champions League.\n\nArsenal finished the Premier League season in third place, their 15th successive top-five finish and the 13th successive season they had achieved qualification for the Champions League. It was also their fifth successive trophyless season, however, something of a disappointment considering this trophyless spell was preceded by five trophy winning seasons from a possible eight (including two seasons where they won the double).\n\n2010–11 saw Arsenal perform well in the Premier League and compete strongly in a title challenge, alongside Manchester United. To prove such a challenge, they faced struggling champions Chelsea on 27 December and mauled them 3–1 at Emirates. Good form continued in the following months and in February, manager Arsène Wenger was awarded Manager of the Month Award. Notable events in this month was the 2–1 win over Barcelona, in which the team came from behind to seal a win, and the 4–4 draw against Newcastle United that is widely regarded to be one of the most bizarre and great games of the Premier League era. They progressed to the final of the League Cup but were beaten 2–1 by Birmingham City, squandering their chances of winning a trophy. After this embarrassment, the Gunners travelled to the Camp Nou to play the second leg of the Barça tie, where they were beaten by the three-time winners and eventual victors. Arsenal's FA Cup run ended with defeat in the quarter-finals to Manchester United. Also, completing a miserable couple of weeks for the Gunners, their title hopes were ended when they lost 2–1 to Bolton Wanderers away in April 2011. After challenging for the title for the majority of the season, Arsenal ended up finishing fourth after losses at Stoke and Aston Villa. Arsenal had failed to win a single trophy for the seventh consecutive year.\nThe 2011–12 campaign commenced for Arsenal on 13 August 2011 against Newcastle in the midst of two major transfer sagas concerning the club's biggest assets: Cesc Fàbregas and Samir Nasri both departed Arsenal. The game finished 0–0 and neither of the said players were in the named squad, but new signing Gervinho was sent off for violent conduct. However, the team did muster a 1–0 win over Italian outit Udinese in the first leg of a Champions League playoff.\n\nOn 15 August 2011, Fàbregas left for Barcelona for an estimated €35 million. In addition to his loss, Nasri left for Manchester City on 24 August 2011, ending a protracted transfer saga after playing for Arsenal in their match against Liverpool on 21 August, in which Arsenal lost 2–0, placing them 14th with one draw and one loss. However, they managed to gain qualification for the Champions League for the upcoming year for the 14th time; the only other English Club to boast such a record in recent years is Manchester United. With mounting injury problems and suspensions, the season was already looking bleak for Arsenal, and this was epitomized by an 8–2 mauling in the hands of Manchester United. Following their collapse early in the season, Arsenal were already written off as title challengers, with some fans suggesting Arsenal's long-standing manager Arsène Wenger be sacked.\n\nAfter the disappointing result against Manchester United, Arsenal went on a spending spree on the last day of the transfer window, purchasing Per Mertesacker, Mikel Arteta, André Santos and Yossi Benayoun. Results began to improve, with a win over newly promoted Swansea City, before a Champions League away draw against Borussia Dortmund. Winning in the League Cup against Shrewsbury Town, in the Premier League against Bolton and in the Champions League against Olympiacos boosted morale around the club, and Arsenal began climbing the league table, after spending a time in the bottom quarter of the table.\n\nDespite losing the first North London Derby of the season against Tottenham, Arsenal continued to gain points, and as of 23 October 2011 were in seventh place in the Premier League. In week that followed, Arsenal managed to extend their good form by beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge 3–5, with a hat-trick from captain Robin van Persie.\n\nDecember 2011 saw the announcement of the possible comeback of Thierry Henry, Arsenal's all-time best player and goalscorer, to whom a statue was built, to the club, and the following month, it was confirmed that he had rejoined the Gunners from the New York Red Bulls on a two-month loan deal coinciding with the Major League Soccer (MLS) off-season. On 9 January 2012, Henry marked his return to Arsenal with his second debut at the Emirates against Leeds United in the third round of the FA Cup. Furthermore, he scored the winning goal – his 227th overall for Arsenal – after coming on as a substitute and collecting a long through from Alex Song. It was a moment that sent Arsenal fans into raptures, and Henry gave them even more to cheer about when he produced another winner to give Arsenal a 2–1 victory in a Premier League match against Sunderland. However, the Gunners suffered a shocking 4–0 loss to Milan in the Champions League in what would eventually be Henry's final match with the club, creating what proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for the club to overturn. Arsenal were also eliminated from the FA Cup in the fifth round, again against Sunderland, losing 2–0.\n\nIn spite of these failures, Arsenal tried to turn the 2011–12 season into a positive one, almost eliminating Milan by winning 3–0 at the Emirates Stadium and winning 5–2 in the second North London Derby of the season against Spurs. Arsenal remained third in the Premier League table; while not mathematically assured of a place in the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League due to Chelsea's continued participation in the Champion's League, with three weeks to go before the end of the 2011–12 Premier League season. Manchester City eventually won the league again after three decades, their first Premiership title.\n\nThe beginning of 2012–13 season saw rumours about the possible departure of star player Robin van Persie, since on 4 July 2012 he announced he would not renew his contract with the club. To this situation, Arsène Wenger signed strikers Olivier Giroud from Montpellier and Lukas Podolski from 1. FC Köln. When Van Persie's transfer to rivals Manchester United was effective, Wenger also purchased Spanish winger Santi Cazorla from Málaga. Arsenal were eliminated in the round of 16 of the 2013 UEFA Champions League 3–3 on away goals against eventual champions Bayern Munich.\n\nDespite being knocked out of the Champions League, Arsenal had a very strong finish to their domestic campaign. After losing the North London Derby 2–1 to Tottenham on 3 March, Arsenal collected 26 points over their remaining ten games, including a 1–1 draw with Manchester United on 28 April, and relegating the newly crowned FA Cup winners Wigan Athletic with a 4–1 victory on 14 May. Arsenal secured fourth place in the Premier League and a Champions League qualifying spot with a 1–0 win over Newcastle. However, with the win came some controversy at half-time in the Tottenham–Sunderland game. It was wrongly reported that Newcastle had tied the game. Much to the dismay of Tottenham supporters, despite their win against Sunderland, Arsenal still finished above them.\n\nThe 2013 off-season was quite tumultuous for Arsenal supporters. Before the start of the transfer window, many of the club's youth players were sold or left the club. Previous Arsenal record transfer fee holder Andrey Arshavin went back to Russian club Zenit Saint Petersburg, and Denílson to São Paulo and Sébastien Squillaci were some of the bigger name players to leave on free transfers. Despite the club's promised ambitions to make big signings, Arsenal had only captured the signature of 20-year-old Frenchman Yaya Sanogo from Auxerre.\n\nHalfway through the summer transfer season, the club had a protracted saga with possible signing of Liverpool striker Luis Suárez. The club believed that a bid above £40 million would trigger a release clause, but this information proved incorrect and Suárez remained under contract with Liverpool. In the chase for Suárez, the club was also thought to be close to signing Gonzalo Higuaín from Real Madrid, but the striker instead signed for Napoli.\n\nWith the 2013–14 Premier League season on the horizon, Arsenal sold Ivorian striker Gervinho to Roma for an estimated £8.5 million and goalkeeper Vito Mannone to Sunderland for an estimated £2.5 million. On transfer deadline day, German international midfielder Mesut Özil was transferred to Arsenal from Real Madrid for a club-record fee. In a twist of fate, Real elected to sell Özil to create the opportunity they needed to sign star forward Gareth Bale from Tottenham, the Gunners' long-time rivals. During the January transfer, Arsenal also acquired the services of Kim Källström from Spartak Moscow until the end of the season.\n\nAt the end of the 2013–14 season, the team finished the Premier League in fourth place. Having beaten defending champions Wigan Athletic in the semi-finals, Arsenal made it to the 2014 FA Cup Final and took on Hull City on 17 May 2014. Coming back from 2–0 down after just eight minutes, the Gunners levelled the score at 2–2 by the end of 90 minutes, with goals from Santi Cazorla and Laurent Koscielny in either half. In the second period of extra time, Aaron Ramsey scored the deciding goal in the 109th minute to seal the win and Arsenal's first major trophy in nine years.\n\nDuring the transfer window that coincided with the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Wenger brought in David Ospina (Colombia) and Mathieu Debuchy (France) after seeing their performances while a pundit for French TV during the tournament, and also added young English defender Calum Chambers from Southampton. His most important signing, however, proved to be Alexis Sánchez, who also impressed during the tournament with Chile and who Barcelona was letting let leave in order to save money for the transfer of Luis Suárez from Liverpool.\n\nIn the Community Shield match against the 2014 Premier League champions Manchester City, Arsenal convincingly won 3–0 for their second trophy within three months. Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and substitute Olivier Giroud scored the goals in the traditional opening game of the English football season.\n\nIn the 2014–15 Premier League, after a hard-fought 2–1 comeback win where Aaron Ramsey scored in the final minute of the first game against Crystal Palace, two away draws at Everton and Leicester City in August, plus right back Bacary Sagna's earlier move to Manchester City, fans wanted another signing. Arsenal managed to sign Danny Welbeck from Manchester United on deadline day while Wenger officiated at a Peace Game hosted by Pope Francis. Arsenal remained undefeated for the first six games until they lost 2–0 at Chelsea on 5 October. They went on to finish third in the league and won the FA Cup for the second year in a row after a 4–0 trouncing of Aston Villa in the final at Wembley, thanks to goals by Theo Walcott, Alexis Sánchez from distance, Per Mertesacker and Olivier Giroud, respectively. This qualified them for their second successive Community Shield, this time against Chelsea, and the Gunners retained the Shield thanks to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's first-half strike. This match was the debut of new goalkeeper Petr Čech, who had coincidentally arrived from Chelsea after having won the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League with the Blues, and the Czech managed to keep a clean sheet against his former club. It was also the first time that Wenger had beaten a team managed by José Mourinho, his 14th attempt, while finishing third in the league.\n\nFor the following season, Arsenal gradually progressed upon their league form, eventually becoming runners-up in 2016. In order to capture that ever-elusive Premier League title for the first time in 12 years, the club spent heavily in the transfer market in the summer of 2016, spending over £80 million on four first-team acquisitions, namely capturing Shkodran Mustafi and Granit Xhaka, who operate as a central defender and central midfielder, respectively. Both positions were long deemed problem positions in the team, with the hope Arsenal could push on and win the league after signing the pair. However, poor league form saw Arsenal competing heavily for the final UEFA Champions League space, having taken a race with Liverpool and Manchester City to the final day of the season. Despite winning 3-1 against Everton, results elsewhere meant they only finished fifth, missing out on a Champions League spot for the first time in two decades, and the first ever under Wenger. However, Arsenal won the FA Cup Final 2-1 against Chelsea, making it their third win in four seasons, and made them the most successful club in the history of the competition.\n\nIn order to rebuild the squad after a disappointing league campaign, and to prepare for the club's first in the UEFA Europa League, Arsenal used the following off-season to sign strongman left-back Sead Kolašinac from Schalke 04, while also purchasing striker Alexandre Lacazette for a club-record £46.5 million. The two players made their debuts in the 2017 FA Community Shield against league champions Chelsea, where Kolašinac scored to send the game to a penalty shootout. Arsenal scored all four of their penalties to claim their 15th Shield and their sixth trophy in five seasons. The club parted ways with seventeen players, including first-team stalwart Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to Liverpool for a record sale fee of £40 million. The club, however, began the 2017-18 campaign poorly, failing to register an away win until December. After outcry from fans about the club's inabilities on the pitch, Arsenal went and appointed backroom trio Sven Mslintat, Raúl Sanllehi, and Huss Farhmy, to act as head scout, head of footballing relations, and contract negotiator respectively, in order to address the club's shortcomings.\n\nFollowing the trio's appointments, Arsenal produced a more aggressive stance in the following transfer market, allowing disgruntled star Alexis Sánchez depart to Manchester United in a swap-deal for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who was a player Arsenal had chased in the past. The club also allowed squad-fillers Francis Coquelin, Mathieu Debuchy, and Theo Walcott to leave, while brokering a deal to allow for the departure of Olivier Giroud, a noble servant to the club, for Chelsea. This was done after Arsenal were able to acquire the signing of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, one of the most coveted forwards in Europe, for a new club-record fee of £56 million. These additions were enough to bring Arsenal to the final of the 2017–18 EFL Cup, although, losing to rampant Manchester City 3-0. Arsenal would then go on their worst losing streak since 2002, losing four consecutive games in all competitions. The club also lost five out of seven league games by March 2018, scoring 12, and conceding 15. When factoring in all competitions, the club conceded an additional two, while registering only one more. This meant Arsenal conceded, on average, over twice a game.\n\n13 May 2018, Arsène Wenger quit Arsenal.\n\nAfter conducting an overhaul in the club's operating model to coincide with Wenger's departure, Spaniard Unai Emery was named as the club's new head coach on 23 May 2018. He agreed to a two-year deal with the club. He would become the club's first ever 'head coach', while also their second ever manager from outside the United Kingdom. His first match was an 8-0 win in a friendly against Boreham Wood. In his first competitive game in charge, on 13 August, his side lost to Manchester City 0–2 in the Premier League. After a second consecutive loss to Chelsea on 18 August, Emery recorded his first win as Arsenal manager on 25 August, in a 3–1 home win over West Ham United. Emery started the Europa League on 20 September 2018 with a 4-2 victory over Vorskla Poltava.\n\nOn 7 August 2018, Alisher Usmanov announced that he would accept an offer from American businessman Stan Kroenke to buy his 30% stake in Arsenal for £550 million, in a deal that would allow Kroenke to take full control of the club.\n\n\n", "id": "7732042", "categories": ["History of association football clubs in England"], "title": "History of Arsenal F.C.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7732070", "text": "Presenilin\n\nPresenilins are a family of related multi-pass transmembrane proteins which constitute the catalytic subunits of the gamma-secretase intramembrane protease complex. They were first identified in screens for mutations causing early onset forms of familial Alzheimer's Disease by Peter St George-Hyslop at the Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases at the University of Toronto, and now also at the University of Cambridge. Vertebrates have two presenilin genes, called \"PSEN1\" (located on chromosome 14 in humans) that encodes presenilin 1 (PS-1) and \"PSEN2\" (on chromosome 1 in humans) that codes for presenilin 2 (PS-2). Both genes show conservation between species, with little difference between rat and human presenilins. The nematode worm \"C. elegans\" has two genes that resemble the presenilins and appear to be functionally similar, sel-12 and hop-1.\n\nPresenilins undergo cleavage in an alpha helical region of one of the cytoplasmic loops to produce a large N-terminal and a smaller C-terminal fragment that together form part of the functional protein. Cleavage of presenilin 1 can be prevented by a mutation that causes the loss of exon 9, and results in loss of function. Presenilins play a key role in the modulation of intracellular Ca involved in presynaptic neurotransmitter release and long-term potentiation induction.\n\nThe structure of presenilin-1 is still controversial, although recent research has produced a more widely accepted model. When first discovered, the PSEN1 gene was subjected to hydrophobicity analysis that predicted that the protein would contain ten trans-membrane domains. All previous models agreed that the first six putative membrane-spanning regions cross the membrane. These regions correspond to the N-terminal fragment of PS-1 but the structure of the C-terminal fragment was disputed. A recent paper by Spasic et al. provides strong evidence of a nine transmembrane structure with cleavage and assembly into the gamma-secretase complex prior to insertion into the plasma membrane. However, because this is a protein with large numbers of hydrophobic regions, it is unlikely that x-ray crystallography will provide definitive proof of the structure.\n\nThe structure of the presenilin-1 C-terminal catalytic fragment was determined using solution NMR. It is made up of alpha helices and is 176 amino acids in length. It was found that Alzheimer's patients carry mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2).\n\nMost cases of Alzheimer's disease are not hereditary. However, there is a small subset of cases that have an earlier age of onset and have a strong genetic element. In patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (autosomal dominant hereditary), mutations in the presenilin proteins (PSEN1; PSEN2) or the amyloid precursor protein (APP) can be found. The majority of these cases carry mutant presenilin genes. An important part of the disease process in Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of Amyloid beta (Aβ) protein. To form Aβ, APP must be cut by two enzymes, beta secretases and gamma secretase. Presenilin is the sub-component of gamma secretase that is responsible for the cutting of APP.\n\nGamma secretase can cut APP at several points within a small region of the protein, which results in Aβ of various lengths. The lengths associated with Alzheimer's disease are 40 and 42 amino acids long. Aβ 42 is more likely to aggregate to form plaques in the brain than Aβ 40. Presenilin mutations lead to an increase in the ratio of Aβ 42 produced compared to Aβ 40, although the total quantity of Aβ produced remains constant. This can come about by various effects of the mutations upon gamma secretase. Presenilins are also implicated in the processing of notch, an important developmental protein. Mice that have the PS1 gene knocked out die early in development from developmental abnormalities similar to those found when notch is disrupted.\n\nThe genes for the presenilins were found through linkage studies using mutations present in familial Alzheimer's cases in 1995.\n\nThe genetic inactivation of presenilins in hippocampal synapses has shown this selectively affects the long-term potentiation caused by theta with the inactivation in presynapse but not the postsynapse impairing short-term plasticity and synaptic facilitation. The release of glutamate was also reduced in presynaptic terminals by processes that involve modulation of intracellular Ca release. This has been suggested to \"represent a general convergent mechanism leading to neurodegeneration\".\n\n", "id": "7732070", "categories": [], "title": "Presenilin"}

The initial three groups were the first purpose-built fleet minesweepers, built with triple hulls at the bow to give extra protection against loss from mine damage when working.

It operates sixteen locations, including the main Central Library location. Although similarly named, the St. Louis Public Library is unrelated to the St. Louis County Library system.\n\nIn 1865, Ira Divoll, the superintendent of the St. Louis Public School system, created a subscription library in the public school library that would later evolve into the St. Louis Public Library. Divoll believed that a library should work in tandem with the public education system and offer citizens an opportunity for self-improvement and culture.\n\nIn 1869, Divoll’s subscription library moved to the Board of Education building. The library consisted of 4 staff members who offered reference services 12 hours a day. The library also encouraged children to visit, and had no age restrictions as did most libraries of the day.\n\nDue to rapid growth of the collection, which grew from 1,500 volumes in 1865 to 90,000 volumes by 1893, the library required more space. In 1893, the library moved into a new space on the top floors of the new Board of Education building. Also in 1893, the citizens of St. Louis voted to move the administration of the library to an independent board, supported by a property tax. This vote enabled the library to operate without subscription fees and be open to all St. Louis residents.\n\nThe library occupied its space in the Board of Education building until 1909, as the Central Library was being constructed. The Board of Education building wasn’t large enough to accommodate the library's growing collection. It was during this time that the library began its role as a lending library, allowing the public to ‘check out’ and take books home.\n\nIn 1901, Andrew Carnegie made a large donation which was used for expansion, including the building which is currently the Central Library. By this time the collection included 90,000 books. By 1938 the collection included 900,000 items, and by 2014, 4,600,000 items \n\nThe St. Louis Public Library operates 17 libraries, including the main Central Library. Branches include Baden, Barr, Buder, Cabanne, Carondelet, Carpenter, Central Express, Charing Cross, Compton, Julia Davis, Divoll, Kingshighway, Machacek, Marketplace, Schlafly, and Walnut Park. In addition to the Central Library building, Barr, Cabanne, Carpenter and Carondelet branch buildings were Carnegie libraries.\n\nThe Central Library building at 13th and Olive was built in 1912 on a location formerly occupied by the St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall and was designed by Cass Gilbert. The main library for the city's public library system has an oval central pavilion surrounded by four light courts. The outer facades of the free-standing building are of lightly rusticated Maine granite. The Olive Street front is disposed like a colossal arcade, with contrasting marble bas-relief panels. A projecting three-bay central block, like a pared-down triumphal arch, provides a monumental entrance. At the rear, the Central Library faces a sunken garden. The interiors feature some light-transmitting glass floors. The ceiling of the Periodicals Room is modified from Michelangelo's ceiling in the Laurentian Library. Renovation and expansion of the building began in 2010 and finished in 2012.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7732123", "categories": ["Cass Gilbert buildings", "1865 establishments in Missouri", "Government of St. Louis", "Landmarks of St. Louis", "Education in St. Louis", "Libraries in Greater St. Louis", "Public libraries in Missouri"], "title": "St. Louis Public Library"}

They are one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the government of China.\n\nDespite the name by which they are known in China, the Tajiks of Xinjiang are not the same as the Tajik people (who speak the Tajik language). The Tajiks in Xinjiang of China, are an extension of the Pamiri people, a different Iranian group who speak the indigenous Eastern Iranian Pamiri languages.\n\nTashkurgan Town became the capital of the Sarikol kingdom (色勒库尔), a kingdom of the Pamir Mountains.\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, the Tajiks were administered by a system of Begs like the rest of Xinjiang. During the Qing dynasty the Chinese claimed suzerainty over the Taghdumbash Pamir in the south west of Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County but permitted the Mir of Hunza to administer the region in return for a tribute.\n\nThe Tajiks of Xinjiang practiced slavery, selling some of their own as a punishment. Submissive slaves were given wives and settled with the Tajiks. They were considered property and could be sold anytime. Their slaves came from numerous sources, enslaving Sunni captives such as Kirghiz in retaliation for Kirghiz slave raids against the Tajiks since the Kirghiz sold them into slavery in these raids, or from Kunjud, Gilgit, Chitral. Slaves from Chitral and Kunjud passed through there to Bukhara. The Sunnis called them Rafidites and did not consider them Muslim.\n\nMost foreign slaves in Xinjiang were Shia Mountain Tajiks, they were referred to by Sunni Turkic Muslims as Ghalcha. Shia Mountain Tajik Ghalchas made up the majority of slave trafficked and sold in Xinjiang to the Sunni Muslim Turkic inhabitants and they were seen as foreigners and strangers. Serfs were treated in a \"wretched\" manner.\n\nAn anti-Russian uproar broke out when Russian customs officials, 3 Cossacks and a Russian courier invited local Turki Muslim (Uyghur) prostitutes to a party in January 1902 in Kashgar, this caused a massive brawl by the inflamed local Turki Muslim populace against the Russians on the pretense of protecting Muslim women because there was anti-Russian sentiment being built up, even though morality was not strict in Kashgar, the local Turki Muslims violently clashed with the Russians before they were dispersed, the Chinese sought an end to tensions to prevent the Russians from building up a pretext to invade.\n\nAfter the riot, the Russians sent troops to Sarikol in Tashkurghan and demanded that the Sarikol postal services be placed under Russian supervision, the locals of Sarikol believed that the Russians would seize the entire district from the Chinese and send more soldiers even after the Russians tried to negotiate with the Begs of Sarikol and sway them to their side, they failed since the Sarikoli officials and authorities demanded in a petition to the Amban of Yarkand that they be evacuated to Yarkand to avoid being harassed by the Russians and objected to the Russian presence in Sarikol, the Sarikolis did not believe the Russian claim that they would leave them alone and only involved themselves in the mail service.\n\nIn the 1940s around 9,000 Tajiks lived in Xinjiang.\n\nDuring the Ili Rebellion, Uyghur forces butchered the livestock of the Tajiks as they advanced south. The Soviet backed insurgents destroyed Tajik crops and acted aggressively against the Tajiks and Kirghiz of China.\n\nThe population of Tajiks in China numbers 41,028 (2000). They are located in China's western Xinjiang region with 60% living in Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County. Despite the name \"Tajik\" that is used to refer to them, the Tajiks of China do not speak the Tajik language. Early 20th-century travelers to the region referred to them as Sarikoli, \"Mountain Tajiks,\" or Ghalcha.\n\nIn China, the languages of the Tajik people have no official written form. The great majority speak the Sarikoli language, which has been heavily influenced by Uyghur, Chinese, and Wakhi. A small proportion speak Wakhi language. Sarikoli and Wakhi are Iranian languages, commonly classified in the Pamir or Eastern Iranian areal groups.\n\nThe Mountain Tajiks in China are adherents of the Aga Khani Nizari Ismaili sect of Shia Islam, and are still a little isolated from the rest of the worldwide Ismaili community, though their communication with other Pamiri (Ismaili) peoples has never stopped. The Chinese authorities allow a few Ismaili religious buildings to function in Xinjiang's Tajik Autonomous District, whose clerics were appointed by the Chinese secular authorities. Restrictions by the Chinese government bars foreign Ismaili preachers from openly working among the Tajiks in China; and the religious leader of the Nizari Ismaili sect, the Aga Khan, was once barred from business with the China's Ismailis. But recently, the Aga Khan has begun to communicate with China more.\n\nFrom 2–4 April 2012, His Highness the Aga Khan (Aga Khan IV), paid an official visit to Ürümqi, China, at the invitation of the Governor of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Mr Nur Bekri, to discuss collaboration between the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) and the autonomous government of Xinjiang. His Highness and Governor Bekri held constructive talks in the meeting and agreed to collaborate in several thematic areas of mutual interest, including poverty alleviation, education, tourism investment, and financial services. The Aga Khan IV had last visited China in 1981.\n\n ,\n", "id": "7732193", "categories": ["Ethnic groups officially recognized by China", "Xinjiang", "Ethnic Tajik people", "Muslim communities of China"], "title": "Tajiks of Xinjiang"}

Shels gained a highly credible 1-1 draw in Lisbon, and drew 0-0 at home. As the away goals rule was not in place at the time, a toss of a coin was held to decide the venue for the replay. Shels choose right, and won the replay 2-1 giving the League of Ireland its first major scalp in Europe. Facing Atlético Madrid in the second round who had appeared in the last two Cup Winners' Cup finals, they were narrowly beaten 1-0 in both legs.\n\nIn 1971/72, Shels played Hungarian side Vasas in the first ever competition of the UEFA Cup but lost 1-0 in Budapest and drew 1-1 at home. Following this, Shels next European appearance would be over 20 years later.\n\nIn the European Cup of 1992/93, despite dominating the home leg, the club's first to be played at Tolka Park, Shels could only draw 0-0 with Ukrainian champions Tavriya Simferopol, and lost the away leg 2-1. The following season Shels exacted revenge on Ukrainian football by knocking out Karpaty Lviv 3-2 on aggregate in the Cup Winners Cup. The home leg which Shels won 3-1, saw Brian Mooney score a stunning 35 yarder on a glorious night for the Reds. Shels then lost to Panathinaikos 5-1 on aggregate in the next round.\n\nIn 1995 and 1996 Shels suffered disappointing defeats home and away to Akranes of Iceland in the UEFA Cup and Norwegian side Brann in the Cup Winners' Cup. In 1997 Shels were drawn to play Scottish side Kilmarnock. Over 600 fans made the trip for the first leg and despite taking the lead through a fantastic goal by Mark Rutherford, Shels lost 2-1 to an injury time goal. Despite dominating the second leg in Tolka Park, it finished 1-1 and Shels were out.\n\nIn 1998 Shels came up against Rangers in the UEFA Cup. The home leg was moved to England for security reasons and despite taking a 3-0 lead, Shels ended up losing 5-3. The return leg in Ibrox Stadium finished 2-0 to Rangers.\n\nIn 1999, Shels were played in the Intertoto Cup for the first time against Swiss side Neuchâtel Xamax. The home leg finished 0-0 and after missing some great chances early on in the away leg, Shels lost out to two late goals.\n\nIn 2000, things started looking up for the Reds in Europe. A late Richie Baker free kick gave Shels a 1-0 away win against Macedonian side Sloga Jugomagnat in the Champions League qualifiers. It was a historic first ever away win in Europe for the Reds, and it was also the first away win in a European tie by a League of Ireland side for eighteen years. In the home leg, winning 1-0 with ten minuted to go, Shels conceded a penalty which was converted. With Sloga only needing one more to progress, Shels survived an injury time scare when defender Owen Heary somehow managed to clear the ball off his own goal line after keeper Steve Williams had been lobbed.\n\nIn the second round against Rosenborg, 10,000 fans crammed into Tolka Park for the first leg, but Shels lost 3-1 despite an excellent performance. The away leg finished 1-1 after Rosenborg grabbed a late equaliser. Richie Foran scored the Reds' goals in both legs.\n\nBrøndby were Shels opponents in the UEFA Cup in 2001/02, and the Danes advanced to the next round after winning 2-0 in Brøndby Stadion and 3-0 in Tolka Park.\n\nThe following season saw Shels back in the Champions League qualifiers, but after drawing 2-2 away to Hibernians of Malta, conceded an injury time goal at home and missed out on a second round tie with Boavista.\n\n2003 saw Shels play Slovenian side NK Olimpija of Ljubljana in the UEFA Cup, but Shels lost 1-0 away and 3-2 at home.\n\nIn the 2004–05 European season, they made history, becoming the first Irish club to reach the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. On this run, Shels beat KR Reykjavík on away goals, followed by a 4–3 aggregate victory against Croatian champions Hajduk Split. This historic run only ended with a loss against Spanish giants, Deportivo La Coruña 3-0, having achieved a 0-0 draw in Lansdowne Road in front of 25,000 fans. That season the club also had, what was then, the longest European run in Irish history, after the Champions League exit at the hands of Deportivo the club was entered into the UEFA Cup. There Shels met French side Lille and were beaten 4-2 on aggregate, having come back from a two-goal deficit in Lansdowne Road to achieve a credible draw thanks to a brace from substitute Glen Fitzpatrick.\n\nIn the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League First Qualifying Round, they overcame Glentoran of Northern Ireland 6–2 on aggregate, 2–1 to Shelbourne at The Oval in Belfast and 4-1 at home in Tolka Park. Jason Byrne scored four of those goals, Glen Crowe and Owen Heary getting the others put Shebourne into the second round. They were drawn to play Romanian club Steaua Bucharest in the Second Qualifying Round of the Champions League. The first leg took place on July 27, at home in Tolka Park, in front of a sell-out crowd and it ended in a 0–0 draw. The away leg, one week later on August 3, saw Shelbourne defeated 4–1 in Stadionul Steaua in Bucharest, mainly due to a number of individual errors. Striker Jason Byrne was, once again, the goalscorer for Shelbourne.\n\n2006 saw Shelbourne participate in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. They initially played Lithuanian side Vėtra in the first round, recording a 5-0 aggregate victory. On 18 June Shelbourne won 1-0 at the Vėtra Stadium in Vilnius, courtesy of a Sean Dillon headed goal just before the interval which was also the club's 50th European tie. The second leg took place in Tolka Park on 24 June, with Shelbourne romping to an easy 4-0 home victory over the Lithuanians thanks to goals from Ollie Cahill, Glen Crowe and Jason Byrne adding two more goals to his impressive European tally. Vetra's severe discipline problems resulted in the Lithuanian club ending the match with only eight players left on the field of play.\n\nShelbourne played Odense of Denmark in the Second Round, but suffered a 3-0 away defeat in TRE-FOR Park, Odense on 2 July. Shels won the second leg at Tolka Park 1-0 thanks to a goal from Cameroon international Joseph Ndo, losing the tie 3-1 on aggregate. This was to be Shelbourne's last European game before their demotion to the League of Ireland First Division. The 1-0 victory in Tolka Park meant Shelbourne became unbeaten in their last eight home European matches.\n\nDespite winning the League of Ireland championship in November 2006, Shelbourne announced on 29 March 2007 that they would not be applying for a UEFA licence to compete in the 2007–08 Champions League first qualifying round. The club was demoted to the First Division by the FAI before the start of the 2007 season due to ongoing financial problems and it was unlikely they would have secured the necessary licence to take part in the competition. \n\n\nShelbourne were ranked in the top 250 until 2006; however, since this time they have not been ranked. Their last ranking was from October 1, 2006.\"\n\n\n\"Correct as of 2019\"\n\nOfficial site:\nIndependent Supporters Group:\n", "id": "7732204", "categories": ["Shelbourne F.C."], "title": "Shelbourne F.C. in European football"}

They soon began writing and recording together, going by the name Oister. In 1974, Seymour and Twilley signed with Shelter Records and formed The Dwight Twilley Band.\n\"I'll never forget the cold November night at the Church Studios in Tulsa. Phil and I had just signed our first recording contract. We had been instructed by the record company to get acquainted with working in a 'real' 16-track studio and not to record a 'real' record. In the confusion of a pivotal moment, it was Phil who pulled me into a secluded hallway and said, 'Dwight, let's make a hit record right now.' That night we recorded 'I'm On Fire.'\"\n\n- Dwight Twilley, in an excerpt from Phil Seymour's letter of remembrance.\n\n\"I'm On Fire\", with little promotion, reached #16 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for the week ending August 2, 1975. The Dwight Twilley Band recorded two albums together, with Phil and Dwight singing lead and harmony vocals, Phil playing drums and bass, Dwight playing guitar and vocals, and their friend Bill Pitcock IV contributing lead guitar. However, a string of unlucky breaks played a significant role in limiting their success. In 1978, Seymour left the band to pursue a solo career.\n\nIn the downtime between recording deals, he worked as a session musician as well as played drums for 20/20 on their self-titled first album as well as drums on Moon Martin's \"Shots from a Cold Nightmare\" album). Seymour sang backing vocals on four of Tom Petty's songs, \"Breakdown\" and \"American Girl\" from his debut album, along with \"Magnolia\" and \"Strangered in the Night\" from Petty's sophomore effort. During 1978, Seymour also traveled to England to work on a solo recording with Denny Cordell producing - five songs were recorded with Chris Spedding on guitar. Two of the songs were released on the compilation \"Precious To Me\" and all five of the 2016 CD \"The London And Los Angeles Unreleased Sessions\".\nIn 1980 Seymour signed to Boardwalk Records, and he released his first solo album, titled \"Phil Seymour\", on January 16, 1981. The album was produced by Richie Podolor, who also produced Seymour's second album and later produced Twilley's \"The Luck\". \"Precious To Me\", the first single from the album, written by Seymour, reached #22 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for the week ending March 28, 1981. It also went to #3 in Australia, where it was certified gold. \"I Really Love You\" reached #13 in South Africa. The album also included a cover of \"Trying to Get to You\" as well as Phil's \"Baby It's You\", which was included on \"Poptopia: Powerpop Classics of the 80s\", a compilation released in 1997 by Rhino.\n\nHis second solo album \"Phil Seymour 2\" was released in 1982 but featured less original material. It included a Tom Petty song, \"Surrender\".\n\nIn 1984 Seymour joined the Textones, a roots rock band led by Carla Olson and George Callins. He recorded an album with them, \"Midnight Mission\", and toured with them as a singer and drummer. During the tour, he noticed lumps appearing on his neck, and he was subsequently diagnosed with lymphoma. Seymour moved back to Tulsa to undergo treatment for the cancer and continued to record and play live locally, albeit at a much diminished pace, until his death on August 17, 1993 at the Tarzana Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 41.\n\nIn 1996, after its acquisition of Shelter Records, EMI's The Right Stuff reissue label released \"Precious To Me\", a 15-song Seymour collection, which served as a companion piece to Dwight Twilley's \"XXI\" collection on the same label. The album included songs from Seymour's days with The Dwight Twilley Band and the Textones as well as unreleased solo material recorded for Shelter in 1978 and with Olson and Callins in 1991 and 1992. \"Midnight Mission\" was reissued in 2001, and in 2005, \"Phil Seymour\" was reissued on CD with three bonus tracks, one each composed by Seymour, Twilley and Pitcock. \"Phil Seymour 2\" was released by Fuel 2000 Records (Universal) on October 2011 with 10 previously unreleased bonus tracks.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7732230", "categories": ["Singers from Oklahoma", "American rock singers", "Deaths from cancer in California", "American rock drummers", "20th-century American guitarists", "1993 deaths", "Musicians from Tulsa, Oklahoma", "20th-century American drummers", "American singer-songwriters", "American rock guitarists", "20th-century American singers", "American rock songwriters", "American male guitarists", "Power pop musicians", "1952 births", "American male singer-songwriters", "Songwriters from Oklahoma", "Guitarists from Oklahoma", "American male drummers", "Deaths from lymphoma"], "title": "Phil Seymour"}

In 1972 it was renamed the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology in honor of philanthropists Dorothy and Gilbert Maxwell.\n\nThe museum was established in 1932 as the Museum of Anthropology of the University of New Mexico by Edgar Lee Hewett, an active anthropologist who founded the University's anthropology department four years earlier. The museum was created to house and display the growing collection of artifacts gathered from field schools of archaeological research associated with the UNM Anthropology Department, the School of American Research, and the Museum of New Mexico.\n\nFrank C. Hibben was the first director of the museum and expanded its holdings by collecting archaeological materials from around the world and in trade with other museums. Exhibits were first situated in UNM's Rodey Hall, which was demolished in 1971. The museum moved to Scholes Hall in 1935, then to the current site in 1961. In 1972 a major construction project expanded museum facilities, which was funded by the philanthropists Dorothy and Gilbert Maxwell. The museum was renamed in their honor and since then, it has been recognized as an important regional museum and a nationally known research center.\n\nThe museum has five exhibit areas that host permanent and changing exhibits which express the human cultural experience. The Ancestors permanent exhibit traces human evolution over four million years and features life-size models of human ancestors. The People of the Southwest permanent exhibit depicts eleven thousand years of the cultural heritage of the American Southwest and features artifacts from Mimbres, Ancestral Puebloan, and Puebloan cultures, as well as displays on UNM field work in New Mexico, which includes a reconstruction of an excavation at Chaco Canyon.

After completing his studies, he taught in Berlin at the Stern conservatory for several years before returning to Hamburg where he remained for the rest of his life, working primarily as a music teacher and choral director.\n\nWhile he wrote works in several different genres, including symphonies, orchestral overtures, operas, piano works, and chamber music, it is his choral works which received the most attention. However, today he is primarily remembered for his String Sextet in D Major, Op. 68.\n\nThis string sextet was known as the “Prize Sextet” because Krug won the Stelzner Prize for chamber music with this composition. The Prize Sextet was originally for 2 Violins, Viola, Violotta, Cello and Cellone, but the publisher of the work (Fritz Kistner) wisely hedged his bets and produced an edition for the standard combination of 2 Violins, 2 Violas and 2 Cellos in addition to the so-called Stelzner version. Of this work, Wilhelm Altmann, the famous chamber music critic, has written:\n\"“If not a masterpiece of the highest order from start to finish, Krug’s Sextet nonetheless comes away with high honors. He uses his themes skillfully and his sonorities are quite successful. The first movement, Allegro, begins with a short but powerful introduction which gives the impression of storms ahead. Instead, the main melody is quite genial and broad. Later, Krug cleverly weaves the introduction into the second theme and uses it as part of the coda. The second movement, Adagio tranquillo, is characterized by a calm, deeply felt melody, which is interrupted by an urgent and highly dramatic middle section. There is no scherzo, but the lively first theme to the finale, Allegro, seems to fill this gap. A quieter and more lyrical second theme provides excellent contrast.”\"\n\n\nSome of the information on this page appears on the website of Edition Silvertrust but permission has been granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.\n", "id": "7732307", "categories": ["People from Hamburg", "German classical composers", "19th-century German musicians", "1849 births", "German male classical composers", "German Romantic composers", "1904 deaths", "20th-century male musicians"], "title": "Arnold Krug"}

It is in the north-east of the city, approx. from Hanley. Sneyd Green borders Smallthorne in the north, Milton in the east, Birches Head in the south, and Cobridge in the west.\n\nMost of Sneyd Green falls within Stoke-on-Trent North, the remainder is in Stoke Central. For local government purposes the greater part of Sneyd Green is in the East Valley electoral ward. Those parts not in East Valley are split between 'Northwood & Birches Head' and 'Burslem South'. That part of Sneyd Green that falls within Burslem South is sometimes referred to as 'Old Sneyd Green'.\n\nThere are twenty wards in the City, each with a population of around 12,000 people and each returning three elected councillors to the Council chamber.\n\nIn addition to the City's electoral wards there are 49 'neighbourhood areas' of which Sneyd Green is one. These neighbourhood areas, a recent attempt by the Council to better describe the geography of the City, have been adopted by the Stoke-on-Trent Local Strategic Partnership and form the basis of the new Local Area Agreements.\n\nDespite having a sizeable council estate, Sneyd Green only has an average number of council tenants for a neighbourhood in Stoke-on-Trent. Also, Sneyd Green has a significantly below average proportion of residents in terraced housing. According to the Council's 'Neighbourhood Area Profile', Sneyd Green is \"typified by privately owned semi-detached housing and pockets of semi-detached council-housing\". Predictably, the average gross household income of Sneyd Green residents is higher than the City's average and the crime rate is below the City average.\n\nThe hub of the community is around the crossroad junction of Hanley Road (B5049), Milton Road and Sneyd Street. Here can be found: a busy ‘Late Shop’ convenience store (A Consumers' cooperative), a doctor's surgery – now closed, a dentist, a chemist, a sub-post office, a small number of other shops, a Chinese take-away, and an Oatcake shop.\n\nSneyd Green's community hall on Noblett Road was one of only twelve council-owned, community-run halls in the city. Today, many of these Halls, including Sneyd Green's, are social enterprises owned by a local Trust. The Holden Lane Residents Association is one of a sizeable number of voluntary bodies that utilise the hall's facilities.\n\nSneyd Green has two primary schools (Holden Lane and Sneyd Green), a large secondary school (Excel Academy) and two churches (St. Andrews Church of England Parish and Wesley Hall Methodist Church on Noblett Road).\n\nThere are two public houses in Sneyd Green (the Berwick and the Sneyd Arms – a third, the Holden Bridge being recently demolished) and a Workingmen's Club (Holden Lane WMC on Ralph Drive – member of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union ).\n\nThe huge Central Forest Park can be found on the south-west fringe of Sneyd Green. In the early 1970s Central Forest Park was created by the City Council from three enormous coal spoil heaps, deep mine shafts, water-filled marl pits, disused railways and decaying buildings. At the time it won conservation awards for land reclamation. Today it is a very pleasant park allowing for a variety of recreational pastimes including angling, cycling, and skate-boarding.\n\nThe Holden Lane Pools is a Local Nature Reserve covering an area of eight and a half hectares. There is young woodland, marshy reed beds, grassland and the main pool, popular with anglers, covers approximately four acres of water and is tree lined around most of its perimeter. The Ford Green Brook, a tributary of the River Trent, flows through a conservation area where angling is not permitted. Some remains of a disused branch of the Caldon Canal (‘The Foxley') can also be found on the site. There is also a footpath, along the trackbed of the former Biddulph Valley railway line (of the North Staffordshire Railway), to Ford Green Hall.\n\nThe Pools can be found in the north-east of Sneyd Green, nestled between the A53 on one side and Holden Lane High School on the other. The main Hanley to Leek bus service passes the site and there is a small car park near the Holden Bridge pub.\n\nThe Friends of Holden Lane Pools were established in January 2004. They work with the City Council's Environment Team to manage the site for wildlife and people. According to the Environment team, the site currently supports \"a wide variety of birds including great crested and little grebes, swans, coots and moorhens. A range of small birds can be seen in the woodland and reed beds. Other wildlife includes grass snakes, which shelter and hunt for frogs in the grassland and marshy areas, plus dragonflies and butterflies\".\n\nAnglers come seeking one of the several carp over that the main pool holds.\n\nLocal bands from this area include Indie/Rock/Alternative band Maybe This Friday and The Decision.\n\nAlso from the area is Nick Barber, the lead singer of Elvis Fontenot and the Sugar Bees, who won European Zydeco band of the year in 2006 and who have played three times in the USA and twice in Europe at major festivals as well as headlining venues all over the UK.\n\nTaz Cool, frontwoman of funk-grunge outfit Ylang Dog Riot, is an active member of the Sneyd Green community.\n\nMembers of AggyFro, who reached the Final of the Official Live & Unsigned competition in 2011 and were regularly played on BBC Stoke, come from Sneyd Green and the surrounding Stoke area.\n\nLeek New Road, which goes through Sneyd Green passing under the Holden Viaduct, forms part of the A53 that stretches from Shrewsbury (Shropshire) to Buxton (Derbyshire) via Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stoke-on-Trent, and Leek. In the Pennines, the A52 reaches an altitude of over above sea level. Not surprisingly, the road is often blocked by snow in the winter. In better weather, keen ramblers and campers from all over North Staffordshire pass through Sneyd Green in their cars on their way to the Peak District.\n\nSneyd Green is named after the prominent local Sneyd family. Keele University was built on the former estate of the Sneyd family. There are a number of prominent historical Sneyds of Keele Hall, such as Ralph Sneyd and William Sneyd. There are number of pubs in the area called the Sneyd Arms.\n\n\n", "id": "7732317", "categories": [], "title": "Sneyd Green"}

A native of Los Angeles, he played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1951–1952, 1954–1956) and New York Giants (1956).\n\nSarni's professional baseball career began in at the age of 15 when he played for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League. In 33 games he went 19-for-83 (.229) with one home run and nine runs batted in. Sarni led Texas League catchers with a .991 fielding percentage while playing for the Shreveport Sports in . He led American Association catchers with 597 putouts and a .989 fielding percentage while playing for the Columbus Red Birds in .\n\nSarni made his major league debut with the St. Louis Cardinals on May 11, 1951 at the age of 23. After hitting for only a .174 average during his rookie year, Sarni was sent back to the Columbus Red Birds in May 1952 in order to trim their roster down to the 25 player limit. He posted a .277 batting average along with 8 home runs and 60 runs batted in during the season with Columbus and, earned a spot on the American Association All-Star team. In October 1953, the Cardinals purchased Sarni from Columbus.\n\nSarni became the Cardinals starting catcher when Del Rice was injured during a play at home plate on June 7, 1954. In 123 games he posted a .300 batting average with 9 home runs and 70 runs batted in. He also led National League catchers with a .996 fielding percentage and 12 double plays. One odd footnote from the 1954 season was a game in St. Louis on July 18 against the Philadelphia Phillies in which, both Sarni and Phillies catcher Stan Lopata played the game without wearing chest protectors because of the intense heat.\n\nThe Cardinals traded Rice to the Milwaukee Braves in June 1955 and, Sarni became their number one catcher. Although his batting average dipped to .255 in , he was hitting above .300 in early June 1956 when, the Cardinals traded him to the New York Giants along with Jackie Brandt, Dick Littlefield and Red Schoendienst for Alvin Dark, Ray Katt, Don Liddle and Whitey Lockman.\n\nSarni took over as the Giants starting catcher and ended the year leading the league's catchers with 61 assists and 10 double plays. During spring training in 1957 he suffered a heart attack that ended his playing career. He was just 29 years old. The Giants kept him on by creating a coaching position for him. In he signed a contract to coach for the Rochester Red Wings in the St. Louis Cardinals organisation then, resigned after one season to take up a career selling stocks and bonds for an investment firm.\n\nIn a 5-year major league career, Sarni played in 390 games, accumulating 311 hits in 1,182 at bats for a .263 career batting average along with 22 home runs, 151 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .313. His lifetime fielding percentage was .991.\n\nSarni died at the age of 55 in Creve Coeur, Missouri.\n\n\n", "id": "7732327", "categories": ["Nashville Vols players", "Minor league baseball coaches", "Baseball players from California", "Columbus Red Birds players", "New York Giants (NL) players", "American people of Italian descent", "Sportspeople from Los Angeles", "New York Giants (NL) coaches", "Los Angeles Angels (minor league) players", "1927 births", "1983 deaths", "Shreveport Sports players", "Major League Baseball catchers", "St. Louis Cardinals players"], "title": "Bill Sarni"}

While a young man he performed for Operation Push with Rev. Jesse Jackson. Later he became an integral member of Phil Cohran's revolutionary Artistic Heritage Ensemble. Later Gibson played and recorded with the popular jazz ensemble Odell Brown and the Organizers. Gibson spent a lot of time in Chicago recording studios, which allowed him to be noticed and picked up by professional musicians who took him on tour. One tour led to another, and soon he was playing and recording with artists such as Donny Hathaway (Everything Is Everything) and Curtis Mayfield. Gibson chose to go on the road with Curtis Mayfield and this led to his success and national recognition for his artistry on the bongo and conga drums.\n\nMaster Henry performed in the Hawaiian Islands in the mid 70's and 80's, making the island of Oahu his home. He teamed with musician, songwriter and producer Kirk Thompson to record the iconic \"Lemuria\" album and collaborated with many of the top local Waikiki musicians of that era, incl: vocalist, Azure McCall and pianist, Tennyson Stevens. He was an integral part of Kirk Thompson's 'Super Session' with Mike Baxter on keys, John Gallarde on bass and Ron Felix on drums. Master Henry was a popular addition to the Waikiki music scene in those years.\n\nWhile performing at the Hard Rock Cafe in Stockholm, Sweden, he met and later married his wife Anne, and made Stockholm his base. He died in Stockholm of a heart attack at age 60. His last concert appearance was with Khaled Habib and Zak Keith at the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm.\n\nHis distinctive style can be heard among other recordings, on Curtis Mayfield's \"Pusherman.\" An unsung Soul artist, Henry felt he had more than paid his dues. In his later years, he was less and less content with being a sideman and began asserting himself as the main attraction, placing his percussion at the forefront of shows. He was known for getting upset with audiences in noisy venues — after demanding their silence and full attention, he would instantly regain his focus and proceed to put on spellbinding performances on the bongos.\n\nMonths after his death in 2002, friends and musicians got together to organize a tribute concert at the Fasching jazz club in Stockholm. His music can still be heard daily on the radio, especially on recordings by Curtis Mayfield.\n\nHenry appeared on several blaxploitation movies such as \"Super Fly\".\n\n", "id": "7732369", "categories": ["American session musicians", "Conga players", "American male drummers", "Burials at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery", "1942 births", "20th-century American drummers", "Bongo players", "American soul musicians", "American expatriates in Sweden", "2002 deaths", "American percussionists"], "title": "Henry Gibson (percussionist)"}

However, 112 seats were remained unfilled, and a succession of by-elections were required in July, August, November and December 1994 and more in December 1995 and April 1996. Three hundred (300) seats or two thirds (2/3) of the parliament were required to be filled for the next convocation.\n\nIn what were the first elections held after Ukraine broke away from the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of Ukraine emerged as the largest party in the Verkhovna Rada, winning 86 of the 338 seats decided in the first two rounds. This election was the result of a compromise between the President and the Verkhovna Rada, which was reached on 24 September 1993 because of a political crisis caused by mass protests and strikes particularly from students and miners. On that day, the Rada adopted a decree to organize parliamentary elections ahead of schedule, and ahead of scheduled presidential elections in June.\n\nAs in the previous this election took place according to the majoritarian electoral system in 450 electoral districts containing several precincts. Each region was assigned a proportion of districts depending on its population. Hence the most mandates were received by the more populated eastern regions of Ukraine, particularly the regions of Donets basin such as Donetsk Oblast and Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.\n\nIn order to be elected a candidate needed to obtain more than 50% of votes and in order for the election to be valid more than 50% of registered voters needed to vote. If no candidate obtained more than 50% in the first round, the top two candidates were listed on the ballot in the second round. In the second round the 50% rule was applied as well. Reelections were called in case if the 50% votes in the second round was not met.\n\nBecause of those conditions several districts in the Verkhovna Rada were left not represented for a whole convocation. Particularly acute that problem was in the city of Kiev that was assigned 23 mandates, while in the parliament only its 10 representatives participated in the second convocation - less than a half. Kiev became the most under represented region.\n\nBlocs were formed in the Rada on 11 May 1994:\n\nThe political blocks formed in the Verkhovna Rada did not exactly represented a similar party. Such parties as the Peasant's Party of Ukraine (SelPU) and the Agrarians for Reform (AZR) (a breakaway SelPU members) formed the Agrarians of Ukraine block. Although some of the deputies, especially from SelPU, joined the Socialist block. The Ukrainian Republican Party (URP), the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (CUN), and the Democratic Party of Ukraine (DemPU) has formed the electoral block \"Derzhavnist\" (Statehood).\n\n\nIn February 1997 the following factions were present in parliament:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the low turnout, 112 seats remained vacant and later in the summer of 1994 (24 and 31 July and 7 August) 20 MPs were elected to the Rada. On 20 November and 4 December nine more MPs were elected.\n\nOn 30 May 1994 MP Roman Kuper died of a heart attack and Leonid Kravchuk was elected as his replacement on 25 September. On 15 July Leonid Kuchma surrendered his parliamentarian mandate after being elected President, and Vasyl Yevrukhov was elected in his place. On 21 August MP Vitaliy Yurkovsky died, and was replaced by Natalya Vitrenko.\n\n", "id": "7732410", "categories": ["Parliamentary elections in Ukraine", "1994 elections in Ukraine"], "title": "1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election"}

After undertaking art studies, he was a staff member at \"The Philadelphia Times\" and the \"Boston Herald\". He also contributed to publications including \"Scribner's\" and \"Harper's\".\n\nBailey was born in Camden, New Jersey. At the age of 15, Bailey became a student at the Pennsylvania Museum School of Art in Philadelphia. \"A year later one of his drawings of flowers was accepted for the annual exhibition of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts where he later studied. In addition to these schools he also had the chance to study at Royal College of Art, London; Academie de l’ecluse, and Acadmie Bilouil, Paris, France. Deciding that “he wanted to see great events and make pictures of them,” he joined the art staff of The Philadelphia Times in 1892 and two years later went to The Boston Herald. He found plenty of action for his pencil in the life of the city-crime, court trials, fires, and shipwrecks-and in the political conventions of 1900.**\"\n\n\"From 1892-1901 he was a staff artist on the Philadelphia Times and the Boston Herald, to later contribute to Scribner's, Harper's, The Century, Everybody's and other leading, The Harper's Weekly, Leslies Weekly and Colliers. Throughout this experience he had to travel extensively. In 1902 he represented the Boston Herald as special artist at the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in London. Then in 1907 he visited Paris, London, Italy, and Germany as a special staff artist for Harper's Magazine. Upon the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, Bailey was the first artist authorized to make drawings of navy yards, gun shops and munition plants ***.\" \"The drawings that he did were later published and exhibited in art museums widely and won Bailey the Official Thanks of Josephus Daniel the former Secretary of the Navy **.\" These drawings were later acquired by the Smithsonian Institution and a set of prints was installed in the French War Museum, Paris **.\"\n\nAfter this expedition, Bailey traveled extensively throughout Spain. He completed his tour in 1921, after traveling cities and small towns all over the country capturing the landscapes and scenes in watercolors and drawings. In 1925 he did another Spanish tour and later this collection of 150 drawings was turned into a published book, \"Little Known Towns of Spain.\" This book received a great amount of attention in addition to the royal decree of thanks from King Alphonso XIII of Spain. Within the book was the following write-up:\n\n\"At a meeting, in Paris, of Agnacio Zuloaga and Vernon Howe Bailey, Senor Zuloga having highly complimented Mr. Bailey on his work in Spain said, “But when I saw your book of watercolors and drawings of Spain, I was angry with you, for you have disclosed to the world the names of Spanish towns of which I hoped it would never learn, for the tourists will spoil them and gone will be their true character, and the life and the old costumes I have loved to paint will have vanished. Within fifteen years Spain will have been spoiled for me.”\n\nBailey's special subject were city streets, landscapes, buildings and maritime scenes in Europe and America. The best known of his drawings are his sketches in pencil of London, his watercolor and drawings of Spain and his drawings of skyscrapers in New York City. Bailey was the first artist privileged by the United States government on the declaration of war to make drawings of navy yards, munition factories, and other centres of war work, as mentioned. These drawings appeared in exhibitions and were published in the leading magazines throughout the country. The collections he created in Spain were later bought by The Hispanic Society, and were shown in the Musée de la Guerre of France contains a collection of lithographs of American war subjects. Besides his work as a newspaper artist in London and America, Bailey illustrated many books.\n\nOnce returning to the United States the series of lithograph studies of New York skyscrapers in 1927 that Bailey did were later exhibited in London under the patronage of the Dutchess of Rutland****.\" After exhibition in London, the drawings were taken to the National Library and Museums in Madrid under the auspices of the Duke of Alba. The exhibition was opened by King Alfonso XIII, who issued him a Royal Decree of Thanks, and he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of Find Arts of San Fernando **.\"\n\nAnother significant moment in Bailey's life was the time when he had the chance to be the only artist permitted to produce a comprehensive collection of drawings of the Pope's private apartments. This project took Bailey a year and during this amazing experience he was able to choose whatever composition and subject he wanted. He created over 100 watercolors and drawings. Later the collection was exhibited in the American Art Asso-Anderson Galleries in New York.\n\n\n", "id": "7732585", "categories": ["1874 births", "American draughtsmen", "People from Camden, New Jersey"], "title": "Vernon Howe Bailey"}

Play was not held between 22 December and Christmas Day due to the Christmas break. Play resumed on Boxing Day in the lead-up to the final. A day's break was also held on New Year's Eve for the New Year. Record prize money of £100,000 for the winner was in offer.\n\nDespite the record field, there was a notable absentee. John Lowe's world ranking had fallen to a level which meant he was forced to qualify for the event – which he failed to do for the first time in his career.

At a depth of 660 km, ringwoodite (gamma-(Mg,Fe)SiO) decomposes into Mg-Si perovskite and magnesiowüstite. This reaction marks the boundary between upper mantle and lower mantle.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7732622", "text": "Denver Seminary\n\nDenver Seminary is an accredited, graduate-level institution based in Littleton, Colorado, with extension campuses in Washington DC and West Texas. It offers Master of Arts, Master of Divinity, Doctor of Ministry, and Master of Theology degrees with numerous specialized concentrations and has enrollment of about 900 students. It is known for its emphasis on training and mentoring as an integral aspect to seminary education. Denver Seminary adheres to the National Association of Evangelicals Statement of Faith.\n\nThe evangelical theological stance of Denver Seminary is captured by the words of the late chancellor Vernon Grounds:\n\nHere is no unanchored liberalism, freedom to think without commitment. Here is no encrusted dogmatism, commitment without freedom to think. Here is a vibrant evangelicalism, commitment with freedom to think within the limits laid down in Scripture.\n\nThis statement was first used by Grounds to stake out Denver Seminary's theological position in the midst of conflict between moderately conservative and ultra-conservative factions of the Conservative Baptist Association that eventually led the ultra-conservative faction to withdraw from the CBA and found the Conservative Baptist Fellowship (CBF). Grounds, formerly the academic dean of fundamentalist Baptist seminary in New York state affiliated with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, eventually became a key spokesperson for the evangelical movement that attributes its roots to the writings of Carl F. H. Henry. Under his leadership, Denver Seminary became firmly rooted in this theological camp.\n\nToday, Denver Seminary is a non-denominational, evangelical seminary that still holds to this statement by chancellor Vernon Grounds.\n\nDenver Seminary was founded in 1950 by members of the newly founded Conservative Baptist Association. This is a group of churches that separated from the Northern Baptist Convention over theological differences stemming from the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy conflict earlier in the twentieth century. The school was originally known as the Conservative Baptist Theological Seminary and, in 1982, changed its name to Denver Conservative Baptist Seminary. The school changed its name again in 1998 to Denver Seminary to reflect its growing appeal to a wide-spectrum of evangelical students. Students are required to sign the statement of faith used by the National Association of Evangelicals.\n\nDr. Carey Thomas became the Seminary's first president in 1950. In 1956, Dr. Vernon Grounds was appointed as the second president and remained so until 1979. During his tenure, Vernon Grounds was responsible for initiating, directing, and managing the Seminary's extensive growth and progress. In June 1962, Denver Seminary was granted associate membership in the American Association of Theological Schools (now the Association of Theological Schools). Full accreditation was achieved in the Association of Theological Schools in 1971 and in the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1972. Forty-one years after Denver Seminary's inception (1991) the student body numbered over five hundred students who came from forty states, fifty-three denominations, and fifteen countries.\n\nIn 1996, Dr. Clyde McDowell, the fifth president, pioneered the groundbreaking effort behind becoming the first seminary ever to receive accreditation by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP) for its counseling degree program. Additionally, Dr. McDowell reinvented the school's approach to seminary education by incorporating an intensive, contextualized mentoring experience into its core curriculum—a program of training and mentoring for which Denver Seminary has become well known.\n\nIn 2005, under the leadership of President Craig Williford, Denver Seminary moved from the Englewood, Colorado location to a new campus in Littleton, Colorado where the school currently resides. Built from the ground up specifically for the Seminary, the campus features an academic/leadership training center; a learning resource center (home to the library and student center); an administrative building, which includes the Shepherd's Gate Counseling Center; and nearly 100 student apartments. The campus is situated next to the historic South Platte River with views of the Rocky Mountains and access to running and biking trails along the river.\n\nIn 2002, Senior Professor of Church History Bruce Shelley authored a biography on Grounds titled \"Transformed by Love:The Vernon Grounds Story\". This book gives a comprehensive overview of Denver Seminary's history as it developed from a small denominational school to a major evangelical seminary under Grounds' leadership.\n\nThe following men have served in the presidency of Denver Seminary.\n\n1. Carey S. Thomas, 1950-56\n2. Vernon C. Grounds, 1956-1979\n3. Haddon Robinson, 1979-1991\n4. Edward L. Hayes, 1993-1996\n5. Clyde McDowell, 1996-1999\n6.

Mark Young, 2009–present\n\nDenver Seminary is accredited by Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada, Higher Learning Commission, the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, and the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP).\n\nSince 1998, Old Testament professor Richard Hess has edited the \"Denver Journal: An Online Review of Current Biblical and Theological Studies\". This is primarily an electronic journal that provides Denver Seminary faculty an opportunity to publish book reviews on the latest theological scholarship.\n\n\"Engage Magazine\" is published biannually since 2013. The magazine features articles written by faculty addressing current topics in the church and ministry as well as stories of students and alumni. It is distributed to Denver Seminary alumni, students, staff, faculty, donors, and friends.\n\nDenver Seminary faculty publications can be found on the Seminary website.\n\nThe Carey S. Thomas library is the largest evangelical protestant library between Chicago and Los Angeles. It is composed of volumes carefully selected to provide the best in theological and scholarly literature as an undergirding for the school's curriculum. The present collection totals approximately 185,000 volumes, both in print and electronic format, and is located in the main library in Littleton, Colorado and in the extension campus libraries in Washington DC and West Texas.\n\n", "id": "7732622", "categories": ["Evangelical seminaries and theological colleges", "Englewood, Colorado", "Private universities and colleges in Colorado", "Education in Arapahoe County, Colorado", "Buildings and structures in Arapahoe County, Colorado", "Seminaries and theological colleges in Colorado", "Littleton, Colorado", "Educational institutions established in 1950"], "title": "Denver Seminary"}

As the senior physician responsible for the mental observation ward at the Central Middlesex Hospital he described and named Munchausen syndrome in a 1951 article in \"The Lancet\".\n\nRichard Asher was born to the Reverend Felix Asher and his wife Louise (née Stern). He married Margaret Augusta Eliot at St Pancras' Church, London on 27 July 1943, whereupon his father-in-law gave him a complete set of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", which doctor and medical ethicist Maurice Pappworth alleged was the source of Asher's \"accidental\" reputation as a medical etymologist. They had three children: Peter Asher (born 1944), a member of the pop duo Peter & Gordon and later record producer, Jane Asher (born 1946), a film and TV actress and novelist, and Clare Asher (born 1948), a radio actress.\n\nThe Asher family home above his private consulting rooms at 57 Wimpole Street was briefly notable when Paul McCartney lived there in 1964–66 during his relationship with Jane Asher.\n\nIn 1964 Asher suddenly gave up his hospital post and perhaps all medical activities. He suffered from depression in later life and reportedly died by his own hand at the age of 57.\n\nAsher was regarded as \"one of the foremost medical thinkers of our times\", who emphasised the need \"to be increasingly critical of our own and other people's thinking\". Asher was particularly concerned that \"many clinical notions are accepted because they are comforting rather than because there is any evidence to support them\".\n\nAsher was hailed as a pioneer in challenging the value of excessive bed rest following treatment, and argued that the Pel–Ebstein fever (a fever characteristic for Hodgkin's disease) was an example of a condition that exists only because it has a name. Asher's 1949 paper \"Myxoedematous Madness\" alerted a generation of physicians to the interaction between the brain and the thyroid gland. As a result, young and elderly psychiatric patients are now screened for thyroid malfunction. Some of the 'madness' cases are now thought to be the early descriptions of Hashimoto's encephalopathy, a rare neuroendocrine syndrome sometimes presenting with psychosis.\n\nAsher is remembered today mostly for his \"refreshingly provoking\" articles which \"sparkle with sequins--his own aphorisms, imaginary dialogue, fantasies, quotations.\" He thought that medical writing should provide \"useful, understandable, and practical knowledge instead of \"allotov-words-2-obscure-4-any-1,2-succidin-understanding-them\".\" Anthologies of his articles were well-received, with the \"Talking Sense\" collection being described as \"still the best advice on medical writing.\" Notable articles include:\n\nThe \"Seven Sins of Medicine\" is a lecture delivered by Asher and later published in \"The Lancet\", describing medical professional behaviour that is considered inappropriate. These sins are often quoted to students:\n\nFrom 1995–2010 an annual prize (2010 value £1,200) in memory of Asher was awarded by the Royal Society of Medicine and the Society of Authors for the best first edition textbook aimed at undergraduate students. The most recent prize was presented to Hugo Farne, Edward Norris-Cervetto and James Warbrick-Smith for their book \"Oxford Cases in Medicine and Surgery\" at the Royal Society of Medicine, 27 October 2010.\n", "id": "7732653", "categories": ["20th-century English medical doctors", "Doctors who committed suicide", "History of mental health in the United Kingdom", "Suicides in London", "English medical writers", "1912 births", "1969 deaths"], "title": "Richard Asher"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7732659", "text": "Nested quotation\n\nA nested quotation is a quotation that is encapsulated inside another quotation, forming a hierarchy with multiple levels. When focusing on a certain quotation, one must interpret it within its scope. Nested quotation can be used in literature (as in nested narration), speech, and computer science (as in \"meta\"-statements that refer to other statements as strings). Nested quotation can be very confusing until evaluated carefully and until each quotation level is put into perspective.\n\nIn languages that allow for nested quotes and use quotation mark punctuation to indicate direct speech, hierarchical quotation sublevels are usually punctuated by alternating between primary quotation marks and secondary quotation marks. For a comprehensive analysis of the major quotation mark systems employed in major writing systems, see Quotation mark.\n\nNested quotes often become an issue using the eval keyword. The eval function is a function that converts and interprets a string as actual JavaScript code, and runs that code. If that string is specified as a literal, then the code must be written as a quote itself (and escaped accordingly).\n\nFor example:\nThis code declares a variable a, which is assigned the value 3, and a blank alert window is popped up to the user.\n\nSuppose we had to make a quote \"inside\" the quoted interpreted code. In JavaScript, you can only have \"one\" unescaped quote sublevel, which has to be the \"alternate\" of the top-level quote. If the 2nd-level quote symbol is the same as the first-level symbol, these quotes must be escaped. For example:\nFurthermore, (unlike in the literature example), the third-level nested quote must be escaped in order not to conflict with \"either\" the first- or second-level quote delimiters. This is true regardless of alternating-symbol encapsulation. Every level after the third level must be recursively escaped for all the levels of quotes in which it is contained.

The production was under the direction of Paul Winarski and starred Greg Korin as the Archbishop. After several revisions by the director and author the play was remounted in Scranton in February 2007 at the Old Brick Theatre. It is a one-man dramatization of events in the life of Catholic Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, whose shady tenure as head of the Vatican Bank included suspicions of money laundering, Ponzi schemes, and even assassination.\nThe original production while well received,underwent several script revisions by the author and director in order to streamline the piece. The revised version which opened in Scranton ran 15 minutes shorter and is now considered the final version of the play.\n\nA Las Vegas production of the play is also in the planning with original star Greg Korin.\n\nThe play takes place in a small office in what may be purgatory, but looks very much like the archbishop's office in Sun City, Arizona, his last residence as a retired man of the cloth.\nMarcinkus relates directly to the audience stories from his youth, growing up in Al Capone's Chicago and how he eventually became a priest. As the piece unfolds he tell his version of the Vatican Bank Scandal, his appointment as head of the bank, the death of Pope John Paul I, and his job as \"bulldog\" to Pope John Paul II. Although dramatic, the piece is lightened by the humor that Flannery has instilled in his version of Marcinkus, who was popularly quoted as saying \"You can't run the church on Hail Marys\" .\n\nThe niece of Archbishop Marcinkus, afraid that the play would be a hatchet job on her uncle, contacted playwright Flannery, who sent her a copy of the text. Not only did she agree that the play was a balanced look at her uncle's life, but even offered a few suggestions which the author included in his rewrite.\n", "id": "7732676", "categories": ["Plays based on real people", "American plays", "2006 plays", "Cultural depictions of American people", "Plays for one performer"], "title": "Marcinkus"}

Leon Sullivan, promoting corporate social responsibility:\n\nIn 1977, Rev. Leon Sullivan, an African-American minister, was a member of the board of General Motors. At the time, General Motors was one of the largest corporations in the United States. General Motors also happened to be the largest employer of blacks in South Africa, a country which was pursuing a harsh program of state-sanctioned racial segregation and discrimination targeted primarily at the country's black population.\n\nSullivan, looking back on his anti-Apartheid efforts, recalled:\n\nStarting with the work place, I tightened the screws step by step and raised the bar step by step. Eventually I got to the point where I said that companies must practice corporate civil disobedience against the laws and I threatened South Africa and said in two years Mandela must be freed, apartheid must end, and blacks must vote or else I'll bring every American company I can out of South Africa.\n\nThe Sullivan principles, introduced in 1977 with one addition in 1984, consisted of seven requirements a corporation was to demand for its employees as a condition for doing business. In general, the principles demanded the equal treatment of employees regardless of their race both within and outside of the workplace, demands which directly conflicted with the official South African policies of racial segregation and unequal rights.\n\nThe principles read:\nThe Sullivan principles were celebrated when introduced and gained wide use in the United States, particularly during the disinvestment campaign of the 1980s. Before the end of South Africa's apartheid era, the principles were formally adopted by more than 125 US corporations that had operations in South Africa. Of those companies that formally adopted the principles, at least 100 completely withdrew their existing operations from South Africa.\n\nHowever, as South Africa's system of apartheid persisted relatively unchanged from the 1970s into the late 1980s, Sullivan \"abandoned [his principles] as not going far enough\" complaining that the principles by themselves were not enough to pressure a South African government steadfast in its refusal to yield to change.\n\nIn 1999, more than 20 years after the adoption of the original Sullivan Principles and six years after the end of apartheid, the Rev. Leon Sullivan and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan together unveiled the new \"Global Sullivan Principles\".\n\nThe overarching objective of these principles, according to Leon Sullivan, is \"to support economic, social and political justice by companies where they do business,\" including respect for human rights and equal work opportunities for all peoples.\n\nIn general, the expanded corporate code of conduct requires adopting multinational companies to be a full participant in the advancement of human rights and social justice internationally.\n\nThe new principles read:\n", "id": "7732687", "categories": ["Racial segregation", "Corporate social responsibility", "International sanctions", "Human rights instruments", "Boycotts of apartheid South Africa", "South Africa–United States relations"], "title": "Sullivan principles"}

The programme was shown every week on CBBC from 27 September 2001 and 20 December 2001 and starred all seven members of the band as fictionalized versions of themselves. The series also featured former \"Brady Bunch\" actor Barry Williams as Dean Strickland, S Club 7's manager.\n\nFollowing the pattern of the previous series of the show, the show was renamed \"S Club 7 in Hollywood\" for American audiences. It aired on the renamed ABC Family network from 29 September 2001 to 26 January 2002.\n\n\nIn the first episode of the series, the group decide to give themselves 24 hours to get themselves a new manager. The group come across Dean Strickland and he adopts the seven as their new manager. Shortly into the series, the group find themselves without a record deal and so they have to search for a deal, or else they'll disband. Luckily, the group find a record company willing to sign them. Unlike \"Miami 7\" and \"L.A. 7\", which portrays the S Club 7 as struggling just to make known of their existence, \"Hollywood 7\" portrays the group's experiencing what they've been hoping for since they came to the States: having an agent, getting a record deal, becoming publicized, etc. They film their first music video, become a support act for a Latin heart-throb, and even have their first concert. At the end of the series, the group have to move back to England to record their album and start internationally promoting S Club 7, just as they're starting to become fully assimilated into American life.\n\nThe series also saw, mirroring real life, a relationship between Hannah and Paul develop. In the fifth episode of the series, they share a kiss which sends shock waves throughout the band.\n\n\"Hollywood 7\" was released on PAL video on 29 April 2002.

He and his friends use the sport of B-Daman to fight the Shadow Alliance (who wants to take over the world). This show takes place in the B-DaWorld where its inhabitants are humans, anthropomorphic animals, and robots. Using the legendary B-Daman, Yamato enters the Winners tournament organized by a group (the JBA in the Japanese version and the IBA (International B-Daman Association) in English version) to become the B-DaChampion. However, he also ends up in fights against the Shadow Alliance.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Shadow Alliance, Yamato is in search of special B-Da Balls called Strike Shots, which originated from shooting stars. After a fight with the mysterious Haja and obtaining his Strike Shot, the Drive Shot, Yamato then met Gunnos, a rookie B-DaPlayer. He got his own Strike Shot to participate in the Winners Tournament along with Yamato's old friends and rivals. But little did they know, a terrible evil is about to put the B-Da World in peril once more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shadow Alliance (called simply \"Shadow\" in Japan) are the main antagonists of Season One with goals of B-DaWorld Domination. Some members of the Shadow Alliance have a 3rd eye which is the symbol of the Shadow Alliance and is a sign that the character is under Marda B.'s control. There are two incarnations of the group: There was the original and the Neo Shadow Alliance. The members of this group are as following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the group from Neon City. They are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGunnos is a rookie B-DaPlayer who first appears in Season 2, episode 2. Despite being hotheaded, sarcastic and limited experience, he possesses amazing skill. His first B-Daman was a rapid-fire B-Daman named Gun Breaker which was a remake of Helio Breaker from Season 1.He enters the Winners Tournament for his village as he promises them that when he left that he would go and win. After encountering Yamato, he tags along and becomes part of the regular rivalry between the two. While he is rude and obnoxious to Yamato, he is extremely polite towards others such as Terry & Joe, even bowing down to them because he thinks they are 'cool and smart,' and he saved a village from bandits using his new B-Daman, Break Ogre and his Strike Shot, the Metal Shot. He is in love with a girl named Kiko, and dislikes the daughter of the highest man in their village.\n\nLittle is known about this boy. He has said that he is the last survivor of a clan who knows the secret of a special B-Daman move. His B-Daman was Revolver Hades. He is befriended by Bull, and slowly begins to accept him as a companion and friend. Bull then vows to make Revolver Hades, even better than Cobalt Saber Fire, in order to help Akyulus win the tournament. In the qualifying rounds of the 2nd Winners Tournament, Akyulus is Division 2 and the contestants had to navigate through a series of difficult obstacles to shoot their B-DaBall into the final hole - a B-Daman version of golf. Akyulus is the first to finish, using Revolver Hades' special spin control abilities, making him the first to qualify. In the quarter finals, the 10 contestants that made it through, are regrouped into Set A and B. Akyulus is grouped into Set A where the five contestants enter a pyramid to face three challenges. They would have to hit a hovering blue ball to pass a challenge and that would transport them to a higher level and eventually out of the pyramid. Akyulus and Enjyu are the victors of this challenge and they come out together so the first to emerge is unknown. In the semi-finals, there are only four contestants left, Yamato, Gunnos, Enjyu and Akyulas. Enjyu and Akyulas face off in a game where they must defend their goal with their B-Daman while attempting to shoot their own B-DaBalls into the opponent's goal. Each player had to score ten goals before they would be declared the winner. Akyulas easily defeats Enjyu, but not before Enjyu finally uses all his strength to score one goal - tarnishing Akyulas' perfect 10-0 to 10-1. Akyulas is said to be a legendary battler from the spirits above. In the Winners Tournament that he joined, he battled last against Yamato. And thanks to that battle, he regained some of his memories, his past. And some of that past is bad. He remembered that 100 years ago, his village was destroyed by the evil side, causing his peaceful village into complete chaos. And, as being a Legendary B-DaPlayer, he also has the power to create Strike Shots. But, when he does that, he loses some of his energy. Thanks to this ability, he attracted the attention of Beadeus and was captured, later forced to create the Ultimate Gadeaum shot. Afterwards, he was released into a dark underground dungeon where Yamato found him. However, due to the creation of the Gadeaum shot, he lost his will and became an uncontrollable, demonic fighter. Also, the Revolver Hades had been upgraded to Gatling Hades sometime during his capture, and he used it to battle and nearly defeat Yamato. However, Yamato managed to rescue him by attacking and disabling Gatling Hades with the Stealth Drive Shot, which was the proof of his and Yamato's friendship. He later on decided to be with Yamato and the gang because Beadeus had already announced to the people of the whole B-DaWorld that Yamato's side and Beadeus's side will fight. In the beginning, Yamato thought that the battle was too easy. Until he found out that the evil sealed by Akyulas's ancestors had been awakened because of the Ultimate Gadeaum Shot that Akyulas had made. Galdezer has now been fully awakened. Now because of the creature's escape, he battled alongside Yamato to defeat Galdezer. He befriends Yamato, Terry, Grey, Gunnos, and all the others later on. Now, in the final battle, it's up to Yamato to succeed. Akyulas thought about Yamato and the Ultimate Gadeaum Shot. He thought that the Strike Shot was so powerful so he thought he should make another Strike Shot that would defeat it. Shin tried to warn him that when he created another Strike Shot, it will cost him his life. He said that he would never create a Strike Shot anymore and would live a happy and peaceful life with Yamato for the rest of their lives. But when he sleeps, he dreamed about Yamato being beaten by Galdezer. He then decided to disobey Shin and create the Ultimate Drive Shot. During the next day, he didn't appear to support his newfound friend, but when Yamato was almost beaten, he then appeared and gave Yamato the Legend Drive Shot. Shin now then knew that he had created another Strike Shot when he told Yamato to use it.\n\nHe is a talking wolf who travels with Akyulas - seems to speak for Akyulas too. He's the one who first talked to Bull when they met. He sometimes annoys Bull, because Bull calls him a lot of names, like \"spot\", \"doggie\" and a lot of other names. He's like the secretary and speaker of Akyulas. He's the one who explained to Yamato and the gang, the past of Akyulas. Ironically, the last time Bull talked to him, Bull finally called him Shin, but he too reacted to the use of his own name as another insult coming from Bull.\n\nHe is a scorpion-haired B-DaPlayer. Obsessed with entering tournament, he took the Random Shot from Terry and defeated Joe. After losing in the Winners Tournament, he also tried to sabotage the tournament, but was stopped by Terry. Haja eventually lost to Terry in the spider match. Fortunately for him, he was able to recover, thanks to Beadeus and his servants. His mission is supposed to be stopping Yamato and his friends from rescuing Akyulas, but Haja disobeys his \"master\". He then destroys Beadeus's spy machines. He later \"hires\" Jinbee to be his loyal servant. Yamato and his friends were unsure of where he ended up to after he tried to stop him again. He was absorbed by Galdezer so that he could have maximum power. After Yamato defeated Galdezer, he was released and promised to everyone that he would never be evil anymore, but then denied it. After that, he was struck by an asteroid. He was the last character to appear in this anime. His B-Daman is the Gale Scorpion which has a quick loading core.\n\nThe B-Daman smith that made Break Ogre.\n\nYago's granddaughter is shown to have interest in Gunnos after he helps save her village.

Two long-time associates of the show also often appeared on air.

Rudy is also the lead singer for the Detroit-area rock band, MindCandy. Beaver (whose real name, Bill Tortoriello, was rarely mentioned) was the long-time Executive Producer of the show and often participated in wacky on-air stunts, such as getting drunk on the air or dressing up in costumes (a beaver costume stunt was the source of his nickname).

Deminski stated that the station wanted to feature more music during the morning drive shift. Deminski and Doyle were given the option to play music, but decided that they were talk-show hosts and not disc jockeys and were not going to continue on WCSX.\n\nDuring the month of March 2010, the hosts had been periodically \"filling in\" with late-night shows on WPHT, a conservative-leaning AM talk station out of Philadelphia. Their shows on WPHT were void of nearly all comedic elements and were much more politically oriented, but despite the leanings of the station, their opinions remained mostly non-partisan.\n\nOn June 24, 2011, Deminski announced that starting July 5, 2011, the pair would return to New Jersey 101.5 WKXW for the afternoon drive show from 2-7 PM on weekdays.\n\nThe Deminski and Doyle show is a political, comedy-based talk show that airs from 2 PM to 7 PM on New Jersey 101.5. Topics vary from entertainment news, to local New Jersey issues, to other offbeat news topics, many of those related to internet topics and with relevant content and polls featured on NJ1015.com . The show relies heavily on interaction from callers. Jeff Deminski describes his show as \"a radio version of the corner bar, where guys will come in and B.S. with the two guys drinking beers at the end, who would be Bill and me. That's kinda the philosophy we've always had.\" Interviews are sometimes conducted with comedians, authors, and other individuals of interest to the hosts. Almost all interviews during the history of the show are done live, either in-studio or via telephone.\n\n", "id": "7732828", "categories": [], "title": "Deminski &amp; Doyle"}

The University of Kentucky team did not take their own referee, a common practice at the time, despite advice to the UK coach Adolph Rupp from Notre Dame coach George Keogan, who had lost to NYU the week prior and who warned Rupp of the discrepancies in officiating between the Midwest and the East.

NYU's Irving Terjesen and Irwin Klein combined to guard one of UK's major players, Leroy Edwards, allowing him to score a mere 6 points (the lowest output of his career).

But once established on his own around the year 1606, Maggini developed his skills and experimented with his designs until he achieved a level of expertise that is still highly regarded.

The car was unveiled on 12 January 2009.\n\nThe F60, the 55th single-seater car produced by Ferrari to compete in Formula One, was named \"F60\" to celebrate the fact that 2009 is Ferrari's 60th year in Formula One, the only team to have competed every year. It was first launched online on 12 January 2009, and Felipe Massa undertook the debut run of the car with a shakedown at Mugello later that day. The car was initially intended to debut at Ferrari's home Fiorano track, but the venue was changed due to poor weather conditions at Maranello.\n\nThe F60's first full test took place at the Mugello Circuit during the week of 19 January 2009.\n\nOn average, the Ferrari F60 is 1.9 seconds faster than the last car, despite the new regulations. In the 2009 season, FIA banned the large bargeboards in front of the radiator and the sidepods. It also placed limits on the wheelbase, making it shorter, simpler front splitter, narrower rear spoiler and certain underside air flows, so that it is less disruptive to the car behind. The Ferrari F60 responded to all of this by improving tiny details from the F2008. The front splitter is located further away from the front wheel, and now has only 1 layer. Ferrari claims this improves air flow to the wheels. The F60 is only fitted with 1-tread slick tires, and a simpler suspension positioned a bit backward in angle. Ferrari removed the large airflow plates and replaced it with a small one, also adjusting some underside air flow. The side mirrors are located at the edge of the car's floor. The FIA's ban on small side wings led to the creation of a \"cleaner\" sidepods acceptable of the smaller engine, and a smooth underside of the chassis. The rear diffuser is revised to meet the regulations that stated it has to produce less downforce.\n\nThe F60 scored its first points in Bahrain, the fourth race of the season. Kimi Räikkönen finished sixth, gaining three points for Ferrari. Felipe Massa had an accident in the Hungarian Grand Prix involving a spring from Rubens Barrichello's Brawn GP car falling off and striking him on his helmet. He did not start the race and for the rest of the season, he was replaced by Ferrari test driver, Luca Badoer and ex-Force India driver Giancarlo Fisichella.\n\nIn early August 2009 Ferrari announced that they had stopped developing the F60 in order to concentrate on the car.\n\nThe F60 won its first and only race of 2009 at the hands of Räikkönen at the Belgian Grand Prix, after starting 6th on the grid. They eventually finished fourth in the constructors standings, just behind McLaren, and making 2009 the worst season for Ferrari since 1993.

The party combined a strong Christian and conservative programme with progressive ideas on labour and tried to provide an alternative for disillusioned Social Democrat voters. Part of the Berlin movement, it increasingly focused on the Jewish question with a distinct antisemitic attitude.\n\nIn December 1877, Adolf Stoecker, domestic chaplain at the court of Emperor Wilhelm I and board member of the Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union, together with the economist Adolph Wagner had founded the Central Association for Social Reform (\"Zentralverein für Sozialreform\"), dealing with injustice and poverty after the Industrial Revolution. The organization was meant to counter the rise of the presumably revolutionary Social Democratic Party and to answer the urging social question on the basis of Protestant religion and monarchism. It was constituted as a laborers' party on 1 February 1878. The program of the CSP included:\n\n\nIn turn, Social Democrats like Johann Most led a large conjugation in protesting against the party and its Christianity while the reformist approach repelled social conservative voters. In the 1878 elections, the party obtained less than 1% of the vote, thereby failing to enter the German Reichstag parliament.\n\nUpon their defeat, the CSP gave up its stance as a workers' party and concentrated on petit-bourgeois sections of the electorate. Although antisemitism was only a minor theme in the early stages of the party, the antisemitic message was carried by the so-called Berlin movement (\"Berliner Bewegung\") of the 1880s, which gathered considerable support. The party linked anti-capitalism with hatred toward Jews, denoting both big business and social liberal or socialist movements as Judaized and fulfilling the plans of the world Jewry to exterminate the German people (which according to the CSP did not include Jews).\n\nThe party never gained mass support, but Stoecker from 1879 onwards was able to obtain a seat in the Reichstag after an electoral coalition with the German Conservative Party (DKP). In the parliament, he acted as a DKP far-right, advocating the abolition of universal suffrage and intriguing against the policies of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck until his resignation in 1890. Stoecker was even able to include some antisemitic remarks in the DKP's 1892 party manifesto, but when the Conservatives became worried with the over-tones in his messages (although they were more targeted at Reform Judaism than orthodox Judaism) the Christian Socials were forced from the coalition in 1896 and approached to the antisemitic German Social Party. In turn, a left-wing group around Friedrich Naumann split off to found the National-Social Association.\n\nThe final demise of the Christian Social Party came in the early 1900s. Stoecker died in 1909 and in November 1918 most members of the CSP under lead of Reichstag member Reinhard Mumm (who succeeded Stoecker in representing the Arnsberg constituency) stepped over to the German National People's Party (\"Deutschnationale Volkspartei\", DNVP) in 1918. The group separated itself again, emerging as the Christian Social People's Service (\"Christlich-Soziale Volksdienst\") in 1929 after the business magnate Alfred Hugenberg had become DNVP chairman.\n\n", "id": "7733080", "categories": ["Political parties of the German Empire", "Defunct political parties in Germany", "Political parties established in 1878"], "title": "Christian Social Party (Germany)"}

The operation is the largest military endeavor undertaken by the Israeli military since Operation \"Summer Rains\" in the summer of 2006. The operation was launched to stop Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel.\n\nPalestinian government officials said on 7 November that IDF troops were beginning to withdraw, thus ending the operation. Fifty-three Palestinians, including 16 civilians, and an IDF soldier, were killed since 31 October.\n\nOn 1 November 2006, in the largest military operation by Israel since Operation \"Summer Rains\", six Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed and 35 people were wounded during a raid on Beit Hanoun by the Israeli military. The raid involved three air strikes, sixty tanks backed by helicopter gunships. The AFP news agency reported that three houses were razed by Israeli bulldozers and a dozen homes were hit by tank shells. The raid was the beginning of Operation \"Autumn Clouds\" by the Israeli military. Both the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and the Prime Minister, Ismail Haniya, have described the raid as a massacre.\n\nOn 3 November 2006 one Palestinian woman was killed and ten were reported wounded by Israeli military fire. The women had gathered outside a mosque in Beit Hanoun after an appeal by the local radio for women to rescue Palestinian militants trapped inside a mosque by disguising the militants as women. The Israeli military claimed that their soldiers had spotted two Palestinian militants dressed in women's clothes hiding within the crowd of women, and that the militants were using the women as human shields.\n\nThe Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Ismail Haniyeh, praised the women whom he said \"...led the protest to break the siege of Beit Hanoun\".\n\nPalestinian government officials said on 7 November that IDF troops were beginning to withdraw, thus ending the operation. Fifty-three Palestinians, including 16 civilians, and an IDF soldier, were killed since 31 October.\n\nSeveral civilian houses in Beit Hanoun were struck by shells, fired by the Israeli Defense Force. At least 19 Palestinian civilians were killed and 40 wounded.\n\nOne day later Assistant Secretary-General Angela Kane of the United Nations Department of Political Affairs briefed the U.N. Security Council on the shelling. She \"urged both sides in the conflict to 'return to dialogue'\". A resolution proposed by Qatar as condemnation of the shelling was brought before the Security Council and was vetoed by the United States, with the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton calling the proposed resolution 'one-sided' and 'politically motivated'. Following this rebuff, a watered-down and non-binding resolution was passed by the U.N. General Assembly on 17 November 2006 expressing the assembly's 'distress' at the shelling and calling for a fact-finding mission to be sent to Gaza. The resolution was passed by a majority including the European Union member states. Among the several objectors were the United States and Israel.\n\nOn 16 November, Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants firing from Beit Hanoun launched a Qassam rocket at the Israeli town of Sderot, killing one and injuring one other. Israel's Prime Minister released a statement saying: \"This is precisely the type of murderous attacks that we are trying to prevent. Israel will take any means necessary in protecting our citizens.\" \n\nIsrael refused to cooperate with the UN Human Rights Council and obstructed any international investigation into the matter. A Human Rights Council mandated mission which was to have been led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was refused to enter Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. On 11 November the United States vetoed a Security Council draft resolution calling for the establishment of a fact-finding mission into the events of 8 November in Beit Hanoun. \n\nA UN report, written by the Special Rapporteur, concluded that ″it seems clear that the indiscriminate firing of shells into a civilian neighbourhood with no apparent military objective constituted a war crime, for which both the commanding officer and those who launched the 30-minute artillery attack should be held criminally responsible″.\n\n", "id": "7733141", "categories": ["Counter-terrorism in Israel", "November 2006 events", "Beit Hanoun", "Israeli attacks against Gaza strip", "Conflicts in 2006", "October 2006 events"], "title": "Operation Autumn Clouds"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7733169", "text": "Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam\n\nThe Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam is an eparchy of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church in India for Knanaya Catholics. The Knanaya are descendants of Syrian Christians of Jewish origin who reportedly migrated to the Malabar coast during the fourth century under the leadership of Nestorian Thomas of Cana. During the 17th century, they split into Catholic and Malankara Church factions.\n\nThe Knanaya (Hebrew: קנניה, Malayalam: ക്നാനായ, Syriac: ܛܢܢܐ, Arabic: قينان), also known as Q'nanaya, Q'nai, Kanai, or Kanahi people are endogamous Jews who settled in Kerala. Their origins are uncertain, but many scholars believe them to be descended from Yemeni Jews who arrived in the fourth century and were a significant component of the Cochin Jewish population until the 16th century. Others believe that they are the descendants of Nestorian Christians with Jewish origins who migrated to the Malabar coast between 431–544 AD under the leadership of Thomas of Cana after the Nestorian schism. The Knanaya trace their ancestry back as the descendants from the southern Kingdom of Judah (the tribes of Judah and Benjamin), which did not intermarry. Hence they were also known as Tekkumbhagar. However, recorded texts suggests they were called as Tekkumbhagar much later by the Portuguese to just distinguish the small community from the collective rest of St. Thomas Christians per spread area. Another variation of history for the name is from pre-16th-century records of the Knanaya community known as Knaithomman Chepped (Knaithomman Copper) plates, in it says the descendants of Thomas of Cana arrived at Kodungallur and stayed in the southern side for Mizrah, these plates are the only surviving evidence for their history before the sixteenth century.\n\nIt is also recorded that the Jewish presence in Kerala was growing after the Bar Kokhba revolt (about 132-135) at that time Jewish populations of Judea were dead, enslaved or in flight. Many of the Persian and Arabian Jews fled abroad, Jewish colonies were founded on the Malabar Coast and at other well known trading posts.\n\nTwenty years or so after the First Council of Nicaea, wealthy merchant Thomas of Cana brought a colony of 400 Syrian Christians (from 72 families, belonging to seven clans: Bagi, Belkuth, Hadai, Kujalig, Koja, Mugmuth, and Thegmuth) from southern Mesopotamia to the Malabar Coast in 345 and strengthened the church founded by Thomas the Apostle. According to Syrian writings, the Knanaya migration was a mission from visions of Episcopa Joseph of Uraha with the blessings of Kustathius, Patriarch of Antioch.\n\nThe tradition says descendants of Thomas of Cana lived on the south side for religious purposes, and built a city with the locals, Mahadevarpattanam, as a reminiscent of Jerusalem which means \"City of the great god\". Some historians consider them as the Southists. The native eighteen families from Paakkanaar lineage who were converted as Knananites Christians and given for regular works by the then ruler Cheraman Perumal stayed on the city's north side and were known as Northists. According to another tradition, the Jewish Knananites settled on the south side of the Periyar and the native converted Knananites lived on the north side of the river. However, the first authentic letter that mentions Knanaya community by J. M. Campori in the 1600s fails to mention this Southist-Northist division. There is also no mention in the history of Saint Thomas Christians of this divisional existence in then Christian community. The most accepted version is that Knananaya is known as Southists because they are descended from the southern kingdom of Judah. They did not intermarry with native Christians or with the converted Knananites, maintaining their Kanahi-Christian identity with Jewish traditions, and remained as an endogamous community. However, this practice is increasingly unpopular and in the modern ages considered as ill forms of casteism sustained from wrong orientation, as a result Knananite factions of Catholic Church and the Syrian Orthodox Church agree of inter-church marriage.\n\nThere are similarities between the Knanaya Christians and the Cochin Jews, with both groups granted 72 privileges by the ruling Cheraman Perumal's. Copper plates in the Paradesi Synagogue were given to Joseph Rabban, a first-century Jewish merchant, and Thomas of Cana reportedly received similar copper plates during the fourth century. Both groups are endogamous. The Knananaya believe that their customs are a continuation of Jewish practices, such as the bride standing on the groom's right, burial of the dead facing Jerusalem, the priest's black velvet cap, the venthanmudy, etc. During Easter, the Knananaya eat unleavened bread and drink \"wine\" made from coconut milk and plums (reminiscent of the Passover matzot and red wine). The Knanaya marriage ceremony includes a bridal canopy, similar to the Jewish one, and ceremonial bathing on the eve of the wedding may parallel the Jewish \"mikveh\". These customs are practiced by the Knanaya, distinguishing them from the St. Thomas Christians. Similarities also exist in the groups' ancient songs, with references to the 72 privileges found in songs of both communities. The songs of both groups are divided into five categories: historical, bridal, biblical, invocational and miscellaneous. In songs shared by both groups, three kings fought bravely and fell when Kodungallur was burned in 1524, and the descendants of Cheraman Perumal, Joseph Rabban and Thomas of Cana fought valiantly to save their town. Similarly, songs of both groups describe the Old Testament characters in a good extend. The similarities are considered to be the common link between Malabar Jews and Knanaya Christians (of Jewish origin) formed in legends, biblical stories, and traditions.\n\nWhen the Portuguese arrived in Kerala, the Knanaya, Nasranis and Cochin Jews were persecuted for their beliefs. An imperial order was issued to confiscate and auction the properties of those who celebrated Passover and Sukkot. Circumcision and reading and writing in Hebrew and Aramaic were prohibited. Tradition says Knanaya artifacts and texts were confiscated and burned by the Portuguese for being heretical and Knananites caught defying the imperial order were occasionally executed. The oppressive Portuguese rule was sometimes resisted, but these movements were futile since the Portuguese executed the protesters.\nThe arrival of Thomas of Cana and his followers are said to be a rejuvenating support for Saint Thomas Christians spiritually. They added the richness to the Syrian (Church of Antioch) traditions and teachings in Malabar. Although the Knanaya remained part of the Syriac Catholic Church, they maintained their ethnic heritage. The Syrian Church prospered until the 15th-century arrival of the Portuguese, who tried to replace the Syrian rites with Latin ones. In 1599, the Portuguese Archbishop Menesis of Goa held a synod at Udayamparoor and changed the Syrian ways which had existed during the arrival of the Knanaya. Archbishop Menesis and his successors were able to convert some Syrians with their power and money. However, a group led by Knanaya priest Anjilimmoottil Ittythomman Kathanar (Rev. Itty Thomas) resisted the Portuguese during the mid-17th century. The Knananites joined after they heard that Patriarch Ahathallah had been drowned by the Portuguese with about 25,000 Syrian Christians assembled in Mattancherry (near Cochin) in January 1653 and pledged with others that they would not accept the Latin teachings. After the pledge, known as the Coonan Cross Oath (\"Koonan Kurishu Satyam\"), the Syrian church split in two. One group, led by Thomas Arkadion of Pakalomattom and Ittythomman Kathanar, continued to follow the Syrian faith and the other group accepted the Roman faith. The Knanaya split into two groups: the Knanaya Jacobites (Southists) and the Knanaya Catholics (Northists).\nThe Knanaya Vicariate Apostolic of Kottayam was created for Knanaya Catholics in 1911. It was elevated to an eparchy by Pope Pius X in his 1923 bull, \"Universi Christiani\". The eparchy of Kottayam was elevated to the rank of a metropolitan see, without a suffragan eparchy, in 2005.\n\n\nThe archeparchy's ministry focuses on education, jobs, health, social services and the media.\n\n\n", "id": "7733169", "categories": ["Religious organizations established in 1911", "Archdiocese of Kottayam", "Roman Catholic dioceses in India", "Roman Catholic dioceses and prelatures established in the 20th century", "1911 establishments in India", "Syro-Malabar Catholic dioceses"], "title": "Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam"}

Barry Schrager, Eberhard Klemens, and Scott Krueger combined to develop ACF2 at London Life Insurance in London, Ontario in 1978. The \"2\" was added to the ACF2 name by Cambridge Systems (who had the North American marketing rights for the product) to differentiate it from the prototype, which was developed by Schrager and Klemens at the University of Illinois—the prototype name was ACF. The \"2\" also helped to distinguish the product from IBM's ACF/VTAM.\n\nACF2 was developed in response to IBM's RACF product (developed in 1976), which was IBM's answer to the 1974 SHARE Security and Data Management project's requirement whitepaper. ACF2's design was guided by these requirements, taking a resource rule oriented approach. Unique to ACF2 were the concepts of \"Protection by Default\" and resource pattern masking.\n\nAs a result of the competitive tension between RACF and ACF2, IBM matured the SAF (Security Access Facility) interface in MVS (z/OS), which allowed any security product to process OS, third-party software and application security calls, enabling the mainframe to secure all facets of mainframe operations.\n\nSKK and ACF2 were sold to UCCEL Corporation in 1986, which in turn was purchased by Computer Associates International, Inc. in 1987.

The temple was built during the rule of the Hoysala Empire. Known to legend as Ekachakranagara, Belavadi is said to be the place mentioned in Mahabharatha where Pandava prince Bheema killed the demon Bakasura and protected the village and its people. Belavadi is 29 km southeast of Chikmagalur town on the Chikmagalur-Javagal highway. It is a short distance from the famous temple towns of Belur and Halebidu, and a visit to this town is a rewarding experience.\n\nThis ornate \"trikuta\" (three shrined) temple was built in 1200 C.E. by Hoysala Empire King Veera Ballala II. The material used is Soapstone. Each of the three shrines has a complete superstructure (tower on top of shrine) and is one of the largest temples built by the Hoysala kings. While the famous temples at Belur and Halebidu are known for their intricate sculptures, this temple is known for its architecture.\n\nThe plan of the temple is unique in that two of the shrines face each other and are located on either side of a wide and spacious open \"mantapa\" (hall) containing thirty seven bays. The temple complex has two closed \"mantapa\"s, one with thirteen bays and another with nine bays, at the end of which is a central shrine. This third shrine is an older construction and exhibits a standard architectural idiom containing all the basic elements of a Hoysala temple. The inner walls of the older shrine are plain, but its roof is well decorated. In all, the temple complex has fifty nine bays (hence it has many pillars), most of which are lathe-turned and bell shaped, while a few have decorative carvings on them. According to Foekema, the outer wall of the temple is of the \"old style\", with one eaves running around the temple where the superstructure meets the wall of the shrine. Below this are miniature decorative towers on pilasters (aedicule). This is followed by a second eves. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants (frieze) are below this eves followed by a set of five moldings that form the base of the wall.\n\nThe two newer shrines have different plans. One shrine is square in shape while the other is star shaped (stellate). The tower of the shrine has an apex called the \"kalasha\" (decorative water-pot like structure) below which are three tiers of decorated miniature roofs. The superstructure over each of three shrines is connected to a low protrusion tower called \"Sukanasi\" (tower over the vestibule, called \"nose\" of the main tower) The \"Sukanasi\" consist of two tiers of decorated miniature roofs. In all other aspects the two shrines are identical. All shrines have sculptured decoration on the towers, and the sculptures on the walls are bold and are visible from a distance. However, they are not sharp and impressive from close quarters unlike in other Hoysala temples. The important sculptures with fine finish are that of the Hindu god Krishna dancing on the head of Kalia the serpent, and the Garuda (eagle).\n\nThis is a Vaishnava temple and all three shrines have images of the Hindu god Vishnu, though in different forms (avatar). The central shrine (older shrine) has an tall image of Narayana with four hands and is considered one of the best examples of Hoysala art. It is well elaborated with ornamentation and stands on a \"padmasana\" (lotus seat). The southern shrine has an tall image of Venugopala (the god Krishna playing a flute) including a \"garuda\" pedestal and the northern shrine has a tall image of \"Yoganarasimha\", sitting in a yoga posture. Decorative sculptures such as \"kirtimukhas\" (gargoyles) are used to make the shrine (\"vimana\") towers ornate.\n\n\n", "id": "7733279", "categories": ["Religious buildings and structures completed in 1200", "12th-century Hindu temples"], "title": "Veera Narayana Temple, Belavadi"}

Eastman Kodak Company, et al. is a class action complaint that alleges that the defendants, \"[i]n marketing, advertising and/or packaging their Flash Memory Cards and Flash Memory Drives, Defendants misrepresent the size of the memory storage contained in the Flash Memory Cards and Flash Memory Drives.\" The complaint accuses the defendants of \"false advertising, unfair business practices, breach of contract, fraud, deceit and/or misrepresentation, and violation of the California Consumers Legal Remedy Act\".\n\nThe complaint, case number CGC-04-428953, was originally filed in Superior Court of the State of California for the county of San Francisco on February 20, 2004. The complaint was first filed as \"\"Vroegh vs. Dane Elec Corp., USA, A Foreign Corporation et al.\"\" When Dane-Elec settled and was dismissed from the case on March 15, 2005, Eastman Kodak became the first defendant. Another plaintiff intervened in January 2004.\n\nThe complaint originally named the following companies as defendants:\n\nThe gravamen of the complaint is the alleged loss in hard drive capacity that is caused by the difference between the measurements calculated using the binary prefix and SI prefix systems.\n\nOn August 16, 2006, there was a proposed final judgement on a proposed settlement and on November 1, 2006, LexisNexis reported in their \"California Legal News\" that the settlement agreement calls for $2.4M in attorney fees. The settlement was finally approved on or about November 21, 2006. The settlement provided for either a refund of 5% of the original purchase price or a 10% coupon on future purchases. The refund amount is in excess of the amount of memory that was allegedly missing. Accordingly, the settlement made available to class members refunds in excess of $100 million. \n\nFive defendants, including Dane Elec, settled the case on a non-class basis. The other five defendants, Eastman Kodak Company, Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., Inc., Lexar Media, Inc., PNY Technologies, Inc., and SanDisk Corporation, settled on a class basis.\n\nThe law firm of Gutride Safier, LLP and Milberg Weiss, have been involved in other significant class action lawsuits in California from which they applied for significant fee payments. Such fee requests are often cited as unreasonable in that they call into question the true motivation of the attorneys, as was the case with these particular attorneys. The requested fees, however, were required to be (and were) approved by courts. Two of the most notable class actions brought by Gutride Safier are the Chavez v. Netflix class action that was settled (but is currently on appeal) when the defendants agreed to pay Gutride Safier $2.5 million and the Orin Safier v. Western Digital Corporation class action that was settled when the defendants agreed to pay Gutride Safier $500,000. The Western Digital case involved the same \"binary vs decimal calculation\" issue as the Vroegh v. Eastman Kodak case. In each of these cases, the named plaintiff was awarded $1000 to $2000 \"\"for their time and effort\"\".\n\nEven though Netflix agreed to pay $2.5 million, the Judge in the case ultimately awarded Gutride Safier approximately $1.3 million.\n\nOn June 23, 2003, Gutride and Safier brought a Business Tort complaint against numerous defendants, including: Amazon.com, Target Corporation, Wal-Mart Corporation, Dell, Good-Guys, and many others for false and deceptive advertising of MP3 players on the same \"binary vs decimal calculation\" issue. Ultimately, all of the defendants settled.\n\n", "id": "7733463", "categories": ["Kodak"], "title": "Vroegh v. Eastman Kodak Co."}

Against French and Lao forces, however, Ong Keo continued the struggle until his murder in 1910. After his death, fighting still continued under his successor Ong Kommandam until at least 1937. Local legend holds that Ong Keo survived the murder attempt and lived until the early 1970s.\n\nOng Keo was an Alak, born in Ban Paktai, Muang Thateng, in what then was part of the kingdom of Champasak, but now is in Xekong or Sekong Province.\n\nHis father was a village chief. Ong Keo moved rapidly up the leadership ladder because of his charisma and intelligence, and his fluency in Lao and Pali. He performed religious ceremonies on Mount Tayun, which was close to his home village. He advocated that foreigners be thrown out. His following grew quickly and soon they began calling him \"Pha Ong Keo\" ( − Wiktionary: prá ong gâew) − \"Venerable Precious-Jewel,\" and a \"Phu Mi Boun\" (, lit. \"person have Buddhist merit\"), usually translated in the messianic sense as \"The Holy Man\".\n\nHe launched his rebellion in Thateng in response to the destruction of the temple of Ban Nong Mek. This rebellion lasted six years before a truce could be made. Phu Mi Boun surrendered to the French in October 1907 after military defeats, epidemics and famine disheartened his troops. Despite his surrender, he never submitted to the conditions the French laid on him. He continued to use the title of \"Great King\" that he had given himself, performed Buddhist/Alak religious rites and encouraged his disciples, particularly Ong Kommandam, to carry on his struggle. In 1910, the French Commissioner of Saravane, Jean-Jacques Dauplay, ordered that he be killed for his \"arrogant\" attitude. Some sources say that Dauplay himself killed Ong Keo after summoning him to a meeting, with a gun he had hid in his hat.\n\n", "id": "7733490", "categories": ["Year of birth missing", "Assassinated military personnel", "1910 deaths", "Laotian military leaders"], "title": "Ong Keo"}

The song was successful in their home country, reaching number two on the \"RPM\" Top Singles chart to become their highest-charting single until \"It's All Been Done\" reached number one in 1999. \"Enid\" was Canada's 28th most successful song of 1992.\n\nThe song's title was inspired by Enid Egers, a waitress at Spanky's Pub in Moncton, New Brunswick. The band found it interesting that \"Enid\" spelled backwards is \"dine.\" Although she was the source of the title itself, the main thrust of the song is about Steven Page's first girlfriend.\n\nThe original studio version has been described as one of the most complex recordings of the band's earlier career by Steven Page in the liner notes for \"Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits.\" It includes a horn section, pedal steel guitar, a cuica and a pastiche of Depeche Mode as an intro (the voice in which is that of producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda).\n\nThe music video was made in 1992 and was the band's second official video. It features the band playing in a room with a red-white-and-blue ball theme, similar to the \"Gordon\" cover. The band stated in \"Barelaked Nadies\" (probably jokingly) that the video was originally supposed to be a parody of the film \"Delicatessen\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7733646", "text": "Medicago lupulina\n\nMedicago lupulina, commonly known as black medick, nonesuch, or hop clover, is a plant of dry grassland belonging to the legume or clover family. Plants of the genus \"Medicago\", or bur clovers, are closely related to the true clovers (\"Trifolium\") and sweet clover (\"Melilotus\"). Like the true clovers, black medick has three leaflets and a small, yellow flower closely resembling those of lesser trefoil. Black medick belongs to the same genus as alfalfa.\n\nThe generic name, \"Medicago\", is derived, via Latin , from Ancient Greek () \"Median\", because alfalfa was believed to have been introduced from the region of Media (now in Iran) in antiquity. The specific name, \"lupulina\", means \"wolf-like,\" and refers to the hop, or willow-wolf (\"Humulus lupulus\"). Its scientific name is a translation of the common name, \"hop clover\" (or \"hop-clover\"), which is also used for several members of the genus \"Trifolium\".\n\nAlso spelled \"medic\" or \"meddick\", the plant is known by a number of alternate names, including \"nonesuch\", \"black nonesuch\", \"black medic clover\", \"hop clover\", \"hop medic\", \"black clover\", \"black hay\", \"blackweed\", \"English trefoil\", \"hop trefoil\", and \"yellow trefoil\". Some of these names are also applied to wildflowers of the related genera \"Trifolium\" and \"Melilotus\".\n\n\"Medicago lupulina\" is an annual or short-lived perennial plant, growing each year from adventitious buds on the roots. Mature plants measure from in height, with fine stems often lying flat at the beginning of growth and later erecting. The leaves are compound, each with three oval leaflets, carried on a short petiole; the center leaflet usually has a longer petiole. The leaflets are hairy, toothed toward the tip, and differ from those of the similar \"Trifolium dubium\" in that they end in a short point.\n\nBlack medick has small (2-3 mm) yellow flowers grouped in tight bunches (compact racemes). On larger plants the flower heads may reach or more. The fruit is a single-seeded pod, 1.5 to 3 mm in diameter, that does not open upon maturation, but hardens and turns black when ripe. Each pod contains a single amber-colored seed.\n\nLike other legumes, the roots of black medick contain nodules hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Plants that survive for more than one year may develop a deep tap root.\n\nA native of the old world, black medick is found throughout Europe, north Africa, the near east, and most of Asia, including India, China, and Korea. It is naturalized in central Asia, Japan, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, and much of South America. Black medick is found throughout the United States, including Hawaii and Alaska.\n\nBlack medick thrives in dry to moist, well-drained soils containing sand, loam, or clay, and is a pioneer plant, often growing on disturbed ground. It grows in alkaline, neutral, and mildly acidic conditions. It does not grow in shady areas. Black medick grows well in limestone soils and on coastal sand dunes, where it suffers less competition from the other plants, and as such is found on many islands, such as Taiwan, the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Madeira. It is resistant to cold and can be found on mountains up to 1,800 meters.\n\nBlack medick is one of the flowers used to make honey. It is frequently found in natural pastures, and may be planted in order to create artificial meadows, especially on dry land. The presence of black medick in large concentrations as a lawn weed may indicate that the soil is poor in nitrogen. However, because black medick and other clovers fix nitrogen in the soil, this deficiency can improve over time due to the presence of these plants.\n\nBlack medick is sometimes used as a fodder plant. Its hardiness and ability to grow in poor soils, as well as its tendency to fix nitrogen in the soil, make black medick a good choice for pasturage, although its fodder value is limited. It is grazed by sheep but is not very palatable to cattle.\n\nBlack medick may be confused with other plants that have three leaflets and small yellow flowers, such as hop trefoil, large hop trefoil, lesser hop trefoil, and yellow woodsorrel.\n\n", "id": "7733646", "categories": ["Medicago", "Flora of Lebanon"], "title": "Medicago lupulina"}

Framed as a contemporary Oedipus tale, the plot focuses on a teenager who, raised by his neurotic aunt, finds himself at the center of a murder investigation after she stabs a man to death in their house. The boy's sexually repressed aunt secretly harbors incestuous feelings for him, while a homophobic detective investigating the crime irrationally believes the murder to be a result of a homosexual love triangle.\n\nGiven a regional release in Oregon in November 1981 through Comworld Pictures, the film expanded to other U.S. cities in early 1982, and was nominated for a Saturn Award for the Best Horror Movie of 1982 by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. It was reissued theatrically in 1983 under the title \"Night Warning\", under which it was subsequently released on home video. \n\nHigh school senior Billy Lynch lives with his protective aunt Cheryl, who has raised him since infancy after his parents died in a car accident. A gifted basketball player, Billy is offered a chance at a scholarship to attend the University of Denver, but Cheryl dismisses the idea, assuming that Billy will stay with her to \"contribute.\" At school, Billy is bullied by one of his basketball teammates, Eddie, who is jealous of Billy's close camaraderie with their coach, Tom Landers; meanwhile Julia, the school newspaper photographer, begins to take romantic interest in Billy.\n\nOn Billy's seventeenth birthday, Cheryl changes her mind about the scholarship, and asks Billy to stop by the television repair shop to have the shop technician, Phil Brody, come by to look at their set. That night, after Phil works on their television, Cheryl makes aggressive sexual advances toward him; when he refuses, Cheryl stabs him to death with a kitchen knife, which Billy witnesses through the window. Cheryl hysterically claims Phil tried to rape her.\n\nA bigoted police detective (and former Marine and Purple Heart recipient), Joe Carlson, is assigned to the case, and is skeptical of Cheryl and the alleged rape attempt. After discovering that Phil Brody was gay, and that he was in a same-sex relationship with Billy's coach, Tom, he assumes the murder to be the result of a love triangle between Phil, Tom, and Billy, and that Cheryl is covering for her nephew. Carlson begins questioning Billy, accusing him of being a \"fag\", and harasses Tom, forcing him to resign from his job at the high school. Carlson also inquires from Julia about her and Billy's sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Cheryl feeds Billy drugged milk which causes him to perform poorly at his scholarship tryout, and cleans out the attic so he can have an apartment space in the house. Sergeant Cook, who has been casing Cheryl's home, believes Billy to be innocent, and is suspicious of Cheryl.\n\nAfter walking in on Billy and Julia having sex, Cheryl becomes enraged with Billy. In the attic, Billy finds a photo of a man named Craig, whom Cheryl claims was one of his mother's old boyfriends. Billy asks Julia to come by the house to distract Cheryl so that Billy can investigate further; locked in a box upstairs, he finds his birth certificate, indicating that Cheryl is actually his mother, and that Craig was his father. Meanwhile, downstairs, Cheryl strikes Julia in the head with a meat tenderizer in a fit of jealousy, and again drugs Billy with milk, rendering him unconscious.\n\nJulia awakens in a secret room in the basement, where she discovers Craig's mummified corpse and his severed head in a jar of formaldehyde next to a makeshift shrine. Cheryl's nosy neighbor Margie, having grown suspicious, arrives shortly after to investigate the goings-on on the property, and is followed into the woods behind the house by Cheryl, who stabs her to death with a machete. Sergeant Cook then enters the house in search of Julia, who has been reported missing by her mother, and is also murdered by Cheryl after discovering Julia in the basement. Cheryl chases Julia out of the house, and they both fall in a pond near the woods, where Cheryl again knocks Julia unconscious.\n\nBilly awakens in the attic, which Cheryl has adorned with his childhood toys, and stumbles downstairs to call the police. While attempting to dial 911, Cheryl attacks him with a knife, and a violent struggle ensues, ending with Billy impaling her with a fireplace poker. Billy calls Tom, asking for help. Shortly after, Carlson arrives at the house, where he finds Tom treating Billy's stab wounds, and sees Cheryl's lifeless body on the floor. In a rage, Carlson blames Billy and Tom for the crimes, and draws his gun on them, despite Julia's insistent cries that Cheryl was responsible. Tom and Carlson get into a scuffle, during which Billy is able to grab the gun, shooting Carlson multiple times. Carlson bleeds to death in front of the living room piano while Billy and Julia embrace, both crying.\n\nThe film was first given a small regional release through Comworld Pictures under the title \"Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker\" in several cities in Oregon, including Salem and Corvallis, on November 20, 1981. A novel tie-in written by Joseph Burgo was issued by Pocket Books on December 1, 1981. The film's theatrical release expanded in March 1982, screening in St. Louis, Missouri, as well as Vancouver, British Columbia. \n\nThe film was re-released in January 1983 under the title \"Night Warning\", first screening in the California cities of San Francisco and Santa Cruz, as well as Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nThe film screened on The Movie Channel in the fall of 1983, and was released on VHS through HBO Home Video under the \"Night Warning\" title in 1985.\n\nIndependent label Code Red issued the film on DVD in 2014, and reissued a Blu-ray on July 18, 2017 which featured a 2K scan of the original film elements.\n\nUpon the film's opening in Corvallis, Oregon, local \"Corvallis Gazette-Times\" critic Lloyd Woods praised the performances of Tyrrell and Svenson as well as the direction of William Asher, whom he felt \"does a credible job in developing the derangement.\" Leonard Maltin awarded the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, writing: \"Explosive, tour-de-force acting by Tyrrell distinguishes this formula horror film.\n\nFollowing its January 1983 re-release under the title \"Night Warning\", critic J. A. Conner of the \"Santa Cruz Sentinel\" characterized the film as a \"Tennessee Williams version of \"Psycho\"\" and deemed it an early contender for the worst films of 1983, summarizing: \"\"Night Warning\" is just another drive-in grindhouse sleazoid mess that some how wandered into town by the back door.\"\n\nAllMovie awarded it two-and-a-half out of five stars and labeled it \"an especially unique entry into the slasher film cycle in the 1980s\" based on its influences, 1960s Gothic horror films. Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"Unfolding deftly under Asher's direction, \"Night Warning\" combines darkly outrageous humor with persuasive psychological validity.\" \"Variety\" called it \"a fine psychological horror film\" in which Tyrrell \"gives a tour-de-force performance\". In \"Horror Movies of the 1980s\", John Kenneth Muir rated it 3.5/4 stars. Muir called it \"a true gem of the decade\" and \"the 1980s most twisted, bizarre cinematic vision of motherhood\".\n\nIn a 2019 article published in \"Film Comment\", Justin Stewart praised Asher for directing \"with a meat-and-potatoes efficiency and visual sense, letting the casting, risk-taking performances, and the twisted, quirky screenplay...  carry the day,\" and also praised Tyrrell's performance.\n\n", "id": "7733654", "categories": ["1980s serial killer films", "American slasher films", "1980s teen horror films", "American serial killer films", "1980s independent films", "Films directed by William Asher", "Films based on works by Sophocles", "English-language films", "American exploitation films", "1980s horror thriller films", "Homophobia in fiction", "American independent films", "Films based on ancient Greek plays", "American teen horror films", "1980s slasher films", "American horror thriller films", "American teen LGBT-related films", "Gay-related films", "1982 horror films", "1980s LGBT-related films", "1982 films", "American films", "LGBT-related horror films"], "title": "Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker"}

He later attended and played baseball at Cypress Junior College in 2000 and went on to play at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2001 through 2003.\n\nHe was selected by the Cleveland Indians in the fifth round (154th overall) of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft.\nHe was recalled from the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on May 1, ,\nand made his major league debut that night as a late-game defensive replacement. On June 29, 2007, Francisco got his first hit and his first home run in his first major league start. His home run came leading off the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Indians a 2–1, walk-off win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.\n\nOn July 29, 2009, Francisco was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with reigning Cy Young Award winner Cliff Lee, for a selection of top minor league prospects including Carlos Carrasco, Jason Donald, Lou Marson, and Jason Knapp.\n\nHe spent the remainder of 2009 and the entire 2010 season as a reserve outfielder and pinch hitter with the Phillies. Following the departure of starting right fielder Jayson Werth, Francisco earned a regular spot in the Phillies' starting lineup at the onset of the 2011 season. By mid season, however, Francisco returned to his reserve role.\n\nThough limited in play during the second half of the year, this year Francisco will most notably be remembered for his clutch performance in Game 3 of the 2011 NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals. In a scoreless game, with Shane Victorino on second, the Cardinals elected to intentionally walk Carlos Ruiz in order to face Francisco.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7733814", "text": "The Great Gatsby (1974 film)\n\nThe Great Gatsby is a 1974 American romantic drama film based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel of the same name. It was directed by Jack Clayton and produced by David Merrick from a screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola. The film stars Robert Redford in the title role of Jay Gatsby, along with Mia Farrow, Sam Waterston, Bruce Dern, Karen Black, Scott Wilson and Lois Chiles, with Howard Da Silva (who previously appeared in the 1949 version), Roberts Blossom and Edward Herrmann. A third film, starring Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio, was released in 2013.\n\nThe rights to the novel were purchased in 1971 by Robert Evans so that his wife Ali MacGraw could play Daisy. After MacGraw left Evans for Steve McQueen, he considered other actresses for the role, including Faye Dunaway, Candice Bergen, Natalie Wood, Katharine Ross, Lois Chiles and Cybill Shepherd. However, Mia Farrow was cast as Daisy and Chiles was given the role of Jordan. Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson and Steve McQueen declined the role of Jay Gatsby, which went to Robert Redford. Beatty wanted to direct producer Evans as Gatsby and Nicholson did not think that MacGraw was right for the role of Daisy, who was still attached when he was approached. Farrow was pregnant during production, and the movie was filmed with her wearing loose, flowing dresses and in tight close-ups.\n\nTruman Capote was the original screenwriter but he was replaced by Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola had just finished directing \"The Godfather\" but was unsure of its commercial reception and he needed the money. He believes he got the job on the recommendation of Robert Redford, who had liked a rewrite Coppola did on \"The Way We Were\". Coppola \"had read Gatsby but wasn't familiar with it.\" He checked himself into a hotel room in Paris (Oscar Wilde's old room) and started. He later recalled:\nI was shocked to find that there was almost no dialogue between Daisy and Gatsby in the book, and was terrified that I'd have to make it all up. So I did a quick review of Fitzgerald's short stories and, as many of them were similar in that they were about a poor boy and a rich girl, I helped myself to much of the authentic Fitzgerald dialogue from them. I decided that perhaps an interesting idea would be to do one of those scenes that lovers typically have, where they finally get to be together after much longing, and have a \"talk all night\" scene, which I'd never seen in a film. So I did that – I think a six-page scene in which Daisy and Gatsby stay up all night and talk. And I remember my wife telling me that she and the kids were in New York when \"The Godfather\" opened, and it was a big hit and there were lines around the block at five theaters in the city, which was unheard of at the time. I said, \"Yeah, yeah, but I've got to finish the Gatsby script.\" And I sent the script in, just in time. It had taken me two or three weeks to complete.\nOn his commentary track for the DVD release of \"The Godfather\", Coppola refers to writing the \"Gatsby\" script, adding \"Not that the director paid any attention to it. The script that I wrote did not get made.\"\n\nWilliam Goldman, who loved the novel, said in 2000 that he actively campaigned for the job of adapting the script, but was astonished by the quality of Coppola's work:\nI still believe it to be one of the great adaptations... I called him [Coppola] and told him what a wonderful thing he had done. If you see the movie, you will find all this hard to believe... The director who was hired, Jack Clayton, is a Brit... he had one thing all of them have in their blood: a murderous sense of class... Well, Clayton decided this: that Gatsby's parties were shabby and tacky, given by a man of no elevation and taste. There went the ball game. As shot, they were foul and stupid and the people who attended them were foul and silly, and Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, who would have been so perfect as Gatsby and Daisy, were left hung out to dry. Because Gatsby was a tasteless fool and why should we care about their love? It was not as if Coppola's glory had been jettisoned entirely, though it was tampered with plenty; it was more that the reality and passions it depicted were gone.\n\nThe Rosecliff and Marble House mansions in Newport, Rhode Island, were used for Gatsby's house while scenes at the Buchanans' home were filmed at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. One driving scene was shot in Windsor Great Park, UK. Other scenes were filmed in New York City and Uxbridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. The film was praised for its interpretation and staying true to the novel, but was criticized for lacking any true emotion or feelings towards the Jazz Age. Based on 34 total reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating of 41%, with an average rating of 5/10. Despite this, the film was a financial success, making $26,533,200 against a $6.5 million budget.\n\nTennessee Williams, in his book \"Memoirs\"' (p. 178), wrote: \"It seems to me that quite a few of my stories, as well as my one acts, would provide interesting and profitable material for the contemporary cinema, if committed to ... such cinematic masters of direction as Jack Clayton, who made of \"The Great Gatsby\" a film that even surpassed, I think, the novel by Scott Fitzgerald.\"\n\nVincent Canby's 1974 review in \"The New York Times\" typifies the critical ambivalence: \"The sets and costumes and most of the performances are exceptionally good, but the movie itself is as lifeless as a body that's been too long at the bottom of a swimming pool,\" Canby wrote at the time. \"As Fitzgerald wrote it, \"The Great Gatsby\" is a good deal more than an ill-fated love story about the cruelties of the idle rich... The movie can't see this through all its giant closeups of pretty knees and dancing feet. It's frivolous without being much fun.\"\n\n\"Variety\"s review was likewise split:\n\nRoger Ebert gave the movie two and a half stars out of four. Comparing film to the book details, Ebert stated:\n\nThe author's daughter, Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, who sold the film rights, had reread her father's novel and noted how Mia Farrow on-set looked the part as her father's Daisy (and portrayed a \"southern attitude\"), while Robert Redford also asked advice to match the author's intent, but her father, she noted, was more in the narrator, Nick.\n\nThe film won two Academy Awards, for Best Costume Design (Theoni V. Aldredge) and Best Music (Nelson Riddle). It also won three BAFTA Awards for Best Art Direction (John Box), Best Cinematography (Douglas Slocombe), and Best Costume Design (Theoni V. Aldredge). (The male costumes were executed by Ralph Lauren, the female costumes by Barbara Matera.) It won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress (Karen Black) and received three further nominations for Best Supporting Actor (Bruce Dern and Sam Waterston) and Most Promising Newcomer (Sam Waterston).\n\nThe film was nominated by the American Film Institute for inclusion in the 2002 list of films, AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions.\n\n\n", "id": "7733814", "categories": ["Films that won the Best Costume Design Academy Award", "1974 films", "1970s romantic drama films", "Films shot in Rhode Island", "Films that won the Best Original Score Academy Award", "American romantic drama films", "Films directed by Jack Clayton", "Films shot in New York City", "English-language films", "American films", "Films based on The Great Gatsby", "Paramount Pictures films"], "title": "The Great Gatsby (1974 film)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7733826", "text": "Significant symbols\n\nIn sociology, a significant symbol is a gesture (usually a vocal gesture) that calls out in the individual making the gesture the same (i.e., functionally identical) response that is called out in others to whom the gesture is directed. Significant symbols are a later by-product of the meaning emergent in the act, which meaning is described, or accounted for, in terms of symbols or language.\n\nSignificant symbols originated by the social behaviorist George Herbert Mead, who made a great impact in sociologist studies in the 20th century. Mead was interested specifically in the work of Wilhelm Wundt. It was from Wundt that Mead gained an understanding how the gesture is involved in social interaction. This sociological term \"significant symbols\" is the basis for symbolic interactionism, which attempts to define the self.\n\nLanguage, in Mead's view, is communication through significant symbols. Physical objects can be significant symbols, but vocal gestures, especially language, are the crucial significant symbols. Language brings out the same response in both the speaker and hearer. Language is the highest form of communication, a mature development of the gesture situation; therefore, the major tool of the interaction from which minds and selves emerge. Language is important because it is the means by which an individual may convey his attitudes and assume the roles of others, and thus participate in the interactionary creation of mind and self. Language also makes possible the critically important ability of people to think, to engage in mental processes. Thinking, as well as the mind, is simply defined as conversation that people have with themselves using language; this activity is like having a conversation with other people. Language allows people to stimulate their own actions as well as those of others.\n\nThrough role-taking and the development of significant gestures and symbols the mind develops as the ability to indicate to one's self the same response that one's gestures had brought out in others, and to control the response in terms of it.\n\nAccuracy in role-taking also implies a preexisting social world of shared linguistic meanings that enable actors to respond to their own oncoming behavior in the same way as the other. Without them, role-taking and coordinated behavior could not proceed.\n\nSignificant symbols' specific meaning differs in various social situations.\n\nSignificant communication may also be defined as the comprehension by the individual through the meaning of her gestures. Mead describes the communication process as a social act since it necessarily requires at least two individuals in interaction with one another. It is within this act that meaning arises. The act of communication has a triadic structure consisting of the following components: \n\nIn and during the social contact, the mind recognizes symbols and translates those symbols, and acts or adjusts to symbols based on the previous knowledge of meaning.\n\nA gesture, then, is an action that implies a reaction. The reaction is the meaning of the gesture and points toward the result (the \"intentionality\") of the action initiated by the gesture. Gestures \"become significant symbols when they absolutely arouse in an individual making them the same responses which they explicitly arouse, or are [intended] to arouse, in other individuals, the individuals to whom they are addressed.\"\n\nAlthough people and animals employ insignificant gestures, only people employ significant gestures, or those that involve thought before a response is made.\n\nSignificant symbols always imply a context within which it has significance, a universe of discourse. The universe of discourse is constituted by a group of individuals carrying on a common social process, within which these symbols have common meaning within that group, regardless of whether the members are making the gestures or responding to them.\n\n", "id": "7733826", "categories": ["Sociological terminology"], "title": "Significant symbols"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7733838", "text": "The Bridge to Freedom\n\nThe Bridge to Freedom, an Ascended Master Teachings religion, was established in 1951 by Geraldine Innocente and other students of the Ascended Masters, after she received what was believed to be an \"anointing\" to become a \"messenger\" for the Great White Brotherhood. This organization believed that their teachings had been given to humanity by the Ascended Masters. These were believed to be individuals who had lived in physical bodies, acquired the wisdom and mastery needed to become immortal and free of the cycles of \"re-embodiment\" and karma, attaining in this way their \"Ascension\". They considered the \"ascension\" to be the complete, permanent union of the purified outer self with the \"I AM\" Presence—meaning that true identity that is the unique individualization of God for each person.\n\nThe members of The Bridge to Freedom claim that a Dispensation and Sponsorship was given by the Ascended Masters for this \"Ascended Master Activity\" to be an outer organization representing the \"Great Brotherhood of Light\", and a continuation of previous efforts by the Ascended Masters to bring Illumination to mankind through Theosophy, Agni Yoga, and the \"I AM\" Activity.\n\nThe members of The Bridge to Freedom believe that Ascended Master El Morya contacted Geraldine Innocente in 1944 and asked her to make a certain application on a daily basis. The story is told that Morya returned one year later asking if she would consent to receive a series of Discourses from the Maha Chohan. Geraldine is said to have agreed, and she then underwent years of training in preparation for her role in the 1950s as a Messenger for the Ascended Masters, the Archangels, Cosmic Beings, the Elohim, and Others of the Spiritual Hierarchy. She served officially in the capacity of Messenger beginning with the inaugural Vesta Dictation on July 17, 1951, until her transition on June 21, 1961.\n\nThe Bridge to Freedom claims that in 1952 the Ascended Master Saint Germain stated that:\n\n\" . . . It was never intended to start a 'new' Activity, but to broaden the field of service of the present Activity, by engaging the competent and willing service of lifestreams not presently allowed full expression of their talents in 'widening the borders of the Father's Kingdom.' Many hundreds of thousands of souls have not been privileged to receive the Instruction brought forth in My Name, due to barriers of language, limitation in the production and distribution of illuminating literature and the unhappy 'excommunications' which resulted from misunderstanding of a human nature. . . . A way and means by which We might reach the consciousness of the people had to be devised. 'The Bridge' was the solution to this problem. Mrs. Ballard was informed prior to any other individual of the purpose for which The Bridge came forth and was courteously invited to allow Us the opportunity of supporting her work and performing through other well qualified individuals the task of reaching other lifestreams than those presently blessed by the knowledge of The \"I AM\" Activity. . . . The Sun cannot limit its shining to one beam, nor the Love of God to one human consciousness, no matter how well attuned it may have been to the Vibrations of the Masters. The souls of men are our concern, all men, of all colors, all countries, because from the Flame in their hearts will come the Illumination which will make this Dark Star a Flaming Sun of Freedom. . . . \" \n\nIt is believed that in September 1952, the Master Morya explained (through Geraldine Innocente) the purpose of the founding of The Bridge to Freedom:\n\n\" . . . The beloved Maha Chohan gave Me a limited Grant, saying that the response of the few whom I had chosen would determine whether I could continue such an association. With well justified trepidation, I endeavored to correspond with the most likely and promising of those who professed to love Us and Our Way. Their response made it possible for Me to continue this Endeavor. Now many good and fine lifestreams, like a golden chain, girdling the Earth, make it possible for Us to transmit the current Action of the Brothers around the planet and bless all life and stimulate all souls by this universal service. This is the purpose of The Bridge, The Bulletin, and this expanded service which is but a part of the one Plan, even as the foundation is laid and a beautiful Spiritual Edifice built thereon. Without the Hierarchy, the Earth would long ago have passed into oblivion, the electrons which compose it returned to the universe, and the souls depending upon it for existence snuffed out like candles before the wind. . . . \" \n\n\n", "id": "7733838", "categories": ["Ascended Master Teachings", "Spiritual organizations", "New religious movements", "Spiritual evolution"], "title": "The Bridge to Freedom"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7733852", "text": "Laura Smith Haviland\n\nLaura Smith Haviland (December 20, 1808- April 20, 1898) was an American abolitionist, suffragette, and social reformer. She was an important figure in the history of the Underground Railroad.\n\nLaura Smith Haviland was born on December 20, 1808, in Kitley Township, Ontario, Canada to American parents, Daniel Smith and Asenath \"Sene\" Blancher, who had immigrated shortly before her birth. Haviland wrote that Daniel was \"a man of ability and influence, of clear perceptions, and strong reasoning powers,\" while her mother Sene was \"of a gentler turn, ... a quiet spirit, benevolent and kind to all, and much beloved by all who knew her.\" The Smiths, farmers of modest means, were devout members of the Society of Friends, better known as Quakers. Haviland's father was a minister in the Society and her mother was an Elder.\n\nThough the Quakers dressed plainly, and strictly forbade dancing, singing, and other pursuits they deemed frivolous, many of their views were progressive by the standards of the day. The Quakers encouraged the equal education of men and women, an extraordinarily forward-thinking position in an age when most individuals were illiterate, and providing a woman with a thorough education was largely viewed as unnecessary. Quaker women as well as men acted as ministers. While most Quakers did not agitate vocally for abolition, the majority condemned slavery as brutal and unjust. It was in this atmosphere that Haviland was raised.\n\nIn 1815, her family left Canada and returned to the United States, settling in the remote and sparsely populated town of Cambria, in western New York. At the time there was no school near their home, and for the next six years Haviland's education consisted of little more than \"a spelling lesson\" given to her daily by her mother. Haviland described herself as an inquisitive child, deeply interested in the workings of the world around her, who at a young age began questioning her parents about everything from scripture to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. Once she had mastered spelling, Haviland supplemented her meager education by devouring every book she could borrow from friends, relatives, and neighbors, reading everything from religious material to serious historical studies.\n\nAt sixteen, Laura met Charles Haviland, Jr., a devout young Quaker, whose parents were both respected ministers. They were married on November 11, 1825, at Lockport, New York. According to Laura, Charles was a devoted husband and theirs was a happy marriage. They were the parents of eight children.\n\nThe Havilands spent the first four years of their marriage in Royalton Township, near Lockport, New York, before moving in September, 1829, to Raisin, Lenawee County in the Michigan Territory. They settled three miles (5 km) from the homestead her parents acquired four years earlier. Michigan was then a largely unsettled wilderness, but land was cheap, and there were a number of other Quakers in the vicinity.\n\nHaviland vividly recalled seeing African Americans verbally abused, and even physically assaulted, in Lockport, New York, when she was a child. These experiences, combined with the horrific descriptions in John Woolman's history of the slave-trade, made an indelible impression.\n\nThe pictures of these crowded slave-ships, with the cruelties of the slave system after they were brought to our country, often affected me to tears ... My sympathies became too deeply enlisted for the poor negroes who were thus enslaved for time to efface.\n\nHaviland and other members of the Raisin community helped Elizabeth Margaret Chandler organize the Logan Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1832. It was the first anti-slavery organization in Michigan. Five years later, in 1837, Haviland and her husband founded a \"\"manual labor school ... designed for indigent children,\"\" which was later known as the Raisin Institute. Haviland instructed the girls in household chores, while her husband and one of her brothers, Harvey Smith, taught the boys to perform farm work. At the Havilands' insistence, the school was open to all children, \"regardless of race, creed, or sex.\" It was the first racially integrated school in Michigan. Some of Haviland's white students, upon learning they were to study with African Americans, threatened to leave. Most were persuaded to remain, however, and Laura wrote that once the students were together in the classroom their prejudices \"soon melted away.\"\n\nIn 1838, Harvey Smith sold his farm, and the proceeds were used to erect accommodations for fifty students. The Havilands expanded the school's curriculum, operating it more closely along the lines of traditional elementary and secondary schools. They then hired a graduate of Oberlin College to serve as the school's principal. Due to their diligence, the Raisin Institute was soon recognized as one of the best schools in the Territory.\n\nAs the Havilands became more actively involved in anti-slavery work, tensions grew within the Quaker community. There was a split between the so-called \"radical abolitionists,\" like the Havilands, who wanted immediate emancipation, and the majority of Orthodox Quakers. Although the Quakers condemned slavery, most did not approve of active participation in abolitionist societies. By 1839, in order to continue with their abolitionist work, the Havilands, her parents, and fourteen other like-minded Quakers, felt compelled to resign their membership. They then joined a group of Methodists known as the Wesleyans, who were equally devoted to the abolitionist cause.\n\nIn the spring of 1845, an epidemic of erysipelas killed six members of Haviland's family, including both of her parents, her husband, and her youngest child. Haviland also fell ill, but survived. At thirty-six, Haviland found herself a widow with seven children to support, a farm to run, the Raisin Institute to manage, and substantial debts to repay. Sadly, just two years later tragedy struck again, when her eldest son died. Due to lack of funds, Haviland was forced to close the Raisin Institute in 1849.\n\nIn spite of her personal losses, she continued with her abolitionist work, and in 1851, she helped organize the Refugee Home Society in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Fugitive slaves were settled there, a church and school were erected for them, and each family was given twenty-five acres to farm. Laura remained on for several months as the settlement's teacher. She then traveled to Ohio, where, with her daughter Anna, she taught in a school founded for African American children in Cincinnati and Toledo, Ohio.\n\nBy 1856, she had raised enough funds to reopen the Raisin Institute, and returned to Michigan. The new curriculum included having former slaves give lectures about the realities of life on a slave plantation. The Institute closed once again in 1864, after most of the staff, and some of the students, enlisted to fight during the Civil War.\n\nDuring the 1830s, the Haviland family began hiding runaway slaves on their farm. Their home became the first Underground Railroad station established in Michigan. After her husband's death, Haviland continued to shelter fugitive slaves in her home, in some cases, personally escorting them to Canada. She played an important role in the Detroit branch of the group, where she was considered railroad \"superintendent\", with George DeBaptiste the \"president\"and William Lambert the \"vice president\" or \"secretary\".\n\nShe also traveled to the South on multiple occasions to aid escaped slaves. Her first trip was made in 1846, in an effort to free the children of fugitive slaves, Willis and Elsie Hamilton. The children were still in the possession of their mother's former slave owner, John P. Chester, a tavern-keeper in Washington County, Tennessee.\n\nChester had learned of the Hamilton's whereabouts and sent slave-catchers after them. When that failed, Chester attempted to lure the Hamiltons to his plantation with the promise that they would be treated as freedmen and reunited with their children. Suspecting a trap, Haviland went to Tennessee in their place, accompanied by her son Daniel and a student from the Raisin Institute, James Martin, who posed as Willis Hamilton. Mr. Chester became irate once he realized Willis Hamilton was not with Mrs. Haviland. He held the trio at gunpoint, threatening to murder them, kidnap James Martin, and enslave him in Willis Hamilton's stead. They managed to escape, but Mr. Chester did not forget Laura Haviland. His family would continue to haunt her for fifteen years, pursuing her legally in court and privately with slave catchers, while barraging her with derogatory letters. The following letter was sent by Chester's son, Thomas K. Chester, in February 1847. It's provides a good example of the tone which permeated the Chester family's correspondence with Haviland:\n\nHaviland responded, sarcastically thanking him for naming the child after her family and stating that she hoped \"\"like Moses, may he become instrumental in leading his people away from a worse bondage than that of Egypt.\"\" Enraged by what he deemed her insolence, Thomas Chester placed a bounty on Haviland's head. All throughout the South he circulated \"hand-bills\" (fliers) describing Mrs. Haviland, detailing her abolitionist work, naming her place of residence and offering $3000, a considerable sum at the time, to anyone willing to kidnap or murder her on his behalf.\n\nThree years later, after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, the Chester family attempted to have Haviland tried under the new statute for \"\"stealing\"\" their slaves. Haviland not only ran the risk of being physically harmed by angry slave-owners, like the Chesters, or their slave-catchers, if found guilty of violating the Fugitive Slave Law she would also be subject to hefty fines and imprisonment. Still, Haviland was determined to continue with her work, no matter what the personal cost:\n\n... I would not for my right hand become instrumental in returning one escaped slave to bondage. I firmly, believe in our Declaration of Independence, that all men are created free and equal, and that no human being has a right to make merchandise of others born in humbler stations, and place them on a level with horses, cattle, and sheep, knocking them off the auction-block to the highest bidder, sundering family ties, and outraging the purest and tenderest feelings of human nature.\n\nFortunately for Haviland, her case was brought before Judge Ross Wilkins, who sympathized with the abolitionists. The Chesters attempted to regain possession of the Hamiltons by force, but were prevented by Haviland and her neighbors. Judge Wilkins delayed her case, allowing Haviland to help the Hamiltons escape to Canada. In the end, Haviland evaded legal punishment.\n\nIn addition to another failed rescue attempt, detailed in her autobiography, Haviland later made other, more successful journeys south that went unmentioned in her memoirs. In the guise of a white cook, and once even posing as a fair skinned free person of color, she visited plantations and managed to help some slaves escape north.\n\n During the Civil War, Laura toured many refugee camps and hospitals, even venturing onto the frontlines, to distribute supplies to displaced citizens, freed slaves, and soldiers.\n\nIn the spring of 1865, the commissioner of the newly created Freedmen's Bureau, General Oliver O. Howard, named Haviland Inspector of Hospitals. Haviland's actual duties consisted of far more than inspecting hospitals. She spent the next two years traveling through Virginia, Tennessee, Kansas and Washington, D.C., distributing supplies, reporting on the living conditions of Freedmen and indigent whites, organizing refugee camps, establishing schools, working as a teacher, volunteering as a nurse at Freedmen's hospitals, and giving public lectures. In an effort to help whites understand what the Freedmen had endured under slavery, she toured abandoned plantations and collected chains, irons, restraints, and other implements which had been used on slaves. Haviland transported these items north and exhibited them during her lectures. She also met personally with President Andrew Johnson to petition for the release of former slaves still being held in Southern prisons for attempting years before to escape slavery.\n\nWhile working at the Freedmen's Hospital in Washington, D.C., Haviland met and befriended Sojourner Truth, who later recalled an incident that took place one day when they had gone into town to get supplies. Haviland suggested they take a street car back to the hospital. Truth described what happened next as follows:\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Freedmen's Aid Commission acquired the former Raisin Institute, renamed it the Haviland Home, and converted it into an orphanage for African American children. Its first residents were seventy-five homeless children brought by Haviland from Kansas. As other children joined their ranks, and their numbers increased, many whites in Michigan became unnerved. They claimed that Haviland was burdening white taxpayers and demanded that Haviland Home be closed. Matters came to a head in 1867, when the orphanage was purchased by the American Missionary Association, who closed the orphanage, and literally threw the orphans out into the street.\n\nHaviland abandoned her work in Washington, D.C., to return to Michigan and help the children. She managed to collect enough donations to purchase the orphanage and began to manage it herself. By 1870, funds were extremely scarce. The situation became so dire that, at Haviland's urging, the state took over the orphanage and it became the Michigan Orphan Asylum.\n\nWhen the Reconstruction ended in 1877, many African Americans fled the South, where they were subject to attacks by racist individuals and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Thousands of African American men, women and children, crowded into makeshift refugee camps in Kansas. Determined to help, Haviland set out with her daughter Anna for Washington, D.C., where she testified about the appalling conditions at the camps, before traveling to Kansas with supplies for the refugees. Using her personal savings, Haviland purchased in Kansas for the Freedmen at one of the refugee camps to live on and farm.\n\nDuring her life, Laura Haviland not only combated slavery and worked to improve the living conditions of Freedmen, she was also actively involved in other social causes, advocating for women's suffrage, and helping to organize the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Michigan.\n\nLaura Haviland died on April 20, 1898 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at the home of her brother, Samuel Smith. She is buried next to her husband in the Raisin Valley Cemetery in Adrian, Michigan.\n\nSymbolically, at Haviland's funeral, hymns were sung by a choir of white and African American singers, and then her casket was carried to the grave by a group white and African American pall-bearers.\n\nIn recognition of her efforts, the town of Haviland, Kansas was named in her honor. A statue of Laura Haviland stands in front of the Lenawee County Historical Museum in Adrian, Michigan.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7733867", "text": "Palmer Hayden\n\nPalmer C. Hayden (January 15, 1890 – February 18, 1973) was an American painter who depicted African-American life, landscapes, seascapes, and African influences. He sketched, painted in both oils and watercolors, and was a prolific artist of his era.\n\nBorn Peyton Cole Hedgeman on January 15, 1890, in Widewater, Virginia, Palmer C. Hayden drew during his childhood, and was introduced into the arts by his older brother who drew as well. (Speculations regarding how many other siblings he had exist, but cannot be proved.) Despite his early interest in art, Hayden's initial ambition was to become a fiddle player, but several obstacles prevented this, two of which were his demure nature and the financial hardships of his family. In reflection years into his seniority, Hayden stated he still continued to regret not following his initial ambition, unwavered by his success as an artist. This conflict is reflected at times in his art; in particular, \"Midnight at the Crossroads\" is a personal painting that depicts the decision he was forced to make. The explicit tilt of his feet and face in the direction of the musician's path, yet his ultimate descent down the path of the artist signifies just how powerful of a conflict this was for Hayden.\n\nAs an adolescent, Hayden relocated to Washington, D.C. in order to find work, where he became a porter and an errand boy. The subject of his sketches shifted to objects and activities he witnessed daily, such as sailboats and fishermen. It was in Washington, D.C. where Hayden ultimately began to pursue an art career, and where he first encountered an experience with explicit racism. Hayden had placed an ad in the local paper for an artist’s assistant, and was bewildered when he was rejected for being African-American upon arriving at the interview. Discouraged, Hayden decided to go into employment as a laborer for the Buffalo Bill Circus and then the Ringling Brothers Circus. He bounced from occupation to occupation with little commitment, then decided to enter the army's black company stationed in the Philippines. Hayden in the army.\n\nDuring his army service, Hayden was stripped of his birth name and was given the name Palmer Hayden instead by a commanding sergeant during World War I. The justification behind this abrupt decision is speculated but ultimately unknown, and two popular theories have emerged within the community of art historian; one theory is employed in Bearden and Henderson's book \"A History of African American Artists: 1792 to the Present\", in which the story follows Hayden asking for a letter of reference from his previous job but having his name mistakenly written as Palmer Hayden instead of Peyton Hedgeman. Unwilling to ask for another letter that correctly identified him, he took the letter and adopted the name Palmer Hayden as he transitioned into the army. The alternate theory is stated in Driskell's \"Harlem Renaissance: Art of Black America\", where it is claimed his commanding sergeant mispronounced his real name, giving him the name Palmer Hayden instead. Despite the modern dispute, it has been factually determined that he thereafter referred to himself as Palmer Hayden and eventually legally changed his name a decade later. Within the army, he found himself pleased with the amount of spare time he had and even found a tutor in second lieutenant Arthur Boetscher, who enjoyed map drawing and would often loosely instruct Hayden. This marked Hayden's first real encounter with any form of artistic education. After four years of participation, Hayden decided to enlist again and this time, was assigned to the 10th Cavalry at West Point. While he was not a cadet, his role was taking care and training the horses that the cadets learned to ride on. At this time, he also enrolled himself in a correspondence drawing course, on which he spent $10 monthly out of the $18 he made monthly.\n\nAfter he was discharged from the army, he relocated to Greenwich Village, a neighborhood located in lower Manhattan within New York City. During the pursuit of his slowly developing art career, he worked as a postal clerk, janitor, and a variety of other part-time jobs in order to provide for himself. This period of his life was disheartening, but was justified when Hayden eventually became a prolific Harlem artist of his era.\n\nHayden pursued artistic professionalism by studying charcoal drawing at Columbia University as he simultaneously worked nights at the post office. While this initially satisfied him, he later determined that his night job ate up more of his time than he liked, so he quit and began janitorial services in various apartment buildings throughout New York City. Coincidentally, the first tenant he worked for was Victor Perard, an artist and art instructor at the Cooper Union, previously called the Cooper Institute. Hayden was hired to clean Perard's studio and was encouraged to continue to develop his art.\n\nHayden eventually decided to pursue a formal education, and studied at the Cooper Union in New York City, Columbia University, and privately with Perard, practicing independent studies at Boothbay Art Colony in Maine during the summers as well. A chance encounter with Alice Dike, a woman for whom he was moving furniture, led to the discussion of art and his experience as an artist. Compelled by his cause, Dike provided him with a brochure from her church broadcasting The Harmon Foundation's \"Award for Distinguished Achievement\", which encouraged individuals to participate and enter their pieces. Hayden decided to enter and in 1926, he won a sum of money and a gold medal for his painting \"Schooners\" after being recognized as the recipient of the \"Distinguished Achievement in Visual Arts\" in the Harmon Foundation's first awards ceremony. In response to this honor, a \"New York Times\" headline crudely glorified him, stating \"“Negro Worker Wins Harmon Art Prizes: Gold Medal and $400 Awarded to Man who Washes Windows to Have Time to Paint\"\", suggesting his employment and race were defining factors of his craft as opposed to his extensive efforts. While racially involved themes were not quite yet prominent concepts in Hayden's work, The Harmon Foundation's white founder William E. Harmon was nonetheless making a blatant social statement by publicly praising art created by an African-American man from a struggling background. The award is additionally credited for launching his career as an artist because of how prestigious of an accomplishment it was seen for anyone, but especially for a simple janitor.\n\nHayden's success with The Harmon Foundation allowed the existence of his premier solo show in April 1926 at the Civic Club. Following his achievements, Hayden combined accumulated funds, as well as his trophy money from The Harmon Foundation and a gracious gift of $3,000 from Dike, to travel to Paris, France, where he found further inspiration for his art. He did not enroll in art school there but the next five years spent in Paris were productive regardless, and Hayden captured not only Parisian society, but also the integration of Afro-European into the upscale environment. He was mentored for a short while by an artist named Clivette Le Fevre, but ultimately, the relationship ended because of Le Fevre's disbelief in Hayden's talents. Hayden's years in Paris, as well as his arguably primitive style, is particularly evident in the 1930 piece \"Nous Quatre a Paris\", which portrays four black men in a cafe, drawn with stereotypically large lips and cartoonish facial features to emphasize characteristically black features that were shunned and often seen as revolting, as a result of the discourse from white beauty.\n\nWhile in France, Hayden did not remain stationed in Paris and also traveled to the coasts in order to continue painting landscapes and seascapes. He was particularly fond of Concarneau, a small village primarily sustained by fishermen, and painted several scenes of the town, one of which being \"Concarneau - Andrée de la Mer\". He also visited several museums and a variety of exhibits, such as the Louvre, and found inspiration within its walls. Hayden became acquainted with philosopher Alain Locke, who showed him African art he had collected from his extensive travels. Hayden's admiration for African art led him to paintings depicting African designs, patterns, and forms, such as \"Fetiche et Fleurs\" in 1933. He was also fascinated by the establishment of colonial Northern African towns and sketched what he saw in museums and exhibits.\n\nAfter five years abroad, traveling with funds borrowed from the American Aid Society of Paris, a non-profit organization meant to support Americans abroad, Hayden decided to return to the United States on August 11, 1932. He remained in New York City, where he had lived before going abroad, and upon his return, he became a Works Progress Administration artist with an impressive salary of about $30 weekly. \n\nIn contrast to his active involvement with African culture and racism abroad, Hayden painted mostly buildings and landscapes at this time. In his free time, he continued with oil and watercolor paintings, but also dabbled in pen and ink drawings. His artwork is most notable for depicting African-American life during the Harlem Renaissance, as well as racial conflicts/obstacles, perceptions of racism, and African folklore. His paintings have been described by some critics as primitive and demeaning for depicting xenophobic stereotypes of African Americans by exaggerating bosoms, lips, and nostrils and portraying the mass consumption of watermelon and other foods associated with black racism, such as in \"The Watermelon Race\". Other art historians find some of the earliest indications of black empowerment in Hayden's work for his ownership and embracement of defining stereotypes that he regurgitated at critics through their exaggerated impact. A great number of his paintings following his years in Paris were associated with the Harlem Renaissance and black urban life in the city. However, while depictions of African-American life are what he is most remembered for, they are not his sole claim to fame; Hayden's career began with landscape portrayal and this continued simultaneously alongside his racially influenced art, with nature originally more prominent than the depictions of African-American life. A particular interest of his was seascapes and life in bustling harbors, as it had been in his adolescence. These particular scenes often held a religious significance for him, which was not further elaborated on by Hayden. Additionally, as his comfort within the artistic community grew, he offered a political voice in his paintings, and in 1935, he depicted \"The Execution of NIRA\", which referenced the Supreme Court's refusal of the National Industrial Recovery Act on the grounds of unconstitutionality. Hayden branching out artistically became more evident as his work became more outspoken and experimental.\n\nOne of Hayden's most prolific works came in 1937, when he created the iconic alleged narrative \"The Janitor Who Paints\". This painting, labeled a protest painting à la \"The Execution of NIRA\", was thought by critics to be a personal commentary on Hayden's sentiments regarding the assorted, meagerly paid early jobs he had to take in order to survive that he was criticized for in the press. Despite his success and popularity not only in America, but also in Europe, Hayden was still regarded by some as an lowly janitor who had little to no artistic training and worth. In this painting, an African-American woman, man, and child are depicted in a crowded area which is made even more stifled by a canvas, cleaning supplies, and simple home decoration. All three are shown with thick, prominent lips, characteristic of caricatures of African people, and in the first draft, a bold portrait of Abraham Lincoln was hung on the wall. The title of the painting, as well as the contrast of cleaning supplies and art material, imply a balance, such as the one that existed in Hayden's own life before he was recognized for his work. Inevitably, Hayden was scrutinized by both the black and white community as problematic for seemingly endorsing negative stereotypes in this painting as well.\n\nTen years after his initial visit in 1926, Hayden returned to Paris briefly; little else is known about this visit. He was back in New York within a year and at the age of 50, he married Miriam Huffman. He decided in 1944 to begin a new project, which resulted in a three-year effort that culminated his most fulfilling works: The John Henry series. The idea was rooted in a legend he had been told in childhood by his father and he took to researching the legitimacy of the folktale, drawing inspiration to integrate into his art. Any other explanations for why Hayden felt so strongly about John Henry and the series as a whole are unclear and unspecified, but are most likely linked to his proud ties to the African-American community.\n\nIn his elder years, Hayden continued to be active with his art, regularly being selected for prestigious awards and traveling between Paris and the United States to fuel his inspiration. Racism remained a relevant topic in his life and art, leading him to publicly speak out against racist policies hindering the African-American and Hispanic communities. An example of this was seen in 1966, when Hayden wrote to William Booth, the Chairman of the City Commission on Human Rights, regarding the advocacy for an equal number of African Americans, Latinos, and white people on the board to prevent mistreatment fueled by prejudice and power. \n\nHayden died on February 18, 1973, shortly after receiving a grant to depict Negro soldiers between the world wars.\n\n\n", "id": "7733867", "categories": ["20th-century American painters", "1973 deaths", "African-American artists", "Painters from Virginia", "People from Stafford County, Virginia", "Harmon prize winners", "1890 births", "Cooper Union alumni", "American male painters", "African folklore"], "title": "Palmer Hayden"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7734020", "text": "Hammond's flycatcher\n\nHammond's flycatcher (\"Empidonax hammondii\") is a flycatcher in the family Tyrannidae. This small insectivorous bird inhabits the coniferous and mixed forests of western North America. The name of this bird commemorates William Alexander Hammond who was the surgeon general of the US Army. Hammond collected bird specimens for Spencer Fullerton Baird.\n\nAdults are 12–14 cm long (4.7-5.5 in), span about 22 cm (8.7 in) across the wing and weigh 8-12 g (0.3-04 oz). They have grayish-olive upperparts, darker on the wings and tail, with whitish underparts; they have a conspicuous white eye ring, white wing bars, a small bill and a short tail. The breast is washed with grey and the sides of the belly with yellow. Female usually have a shorter, wider bill compare with male's. Immature are similar to adults, but have broader wing bars and are more buff.\n\nMany species of \"Empidonax\" flycatchers look closely alike. Hammond's flycatchers are mainly confused with Dusky (\"E. oberholseri\") and Gray (\"E. wrightii\") flycatchers, which are similar in color and size and have an overlapping range. The best way to distinguish the Hammond's flycatcher is by its call, breeding habitat and/or range.\n\nHammond's flycatchers are part of the genus \"Empidonax\", which includes a dozen of other species. Despite the relatively large range of the species, the Hammond's flycatcher does not present a lot of genetic variations. This might be the result of a bottleneck event, that could have occurred when the species range was confined to the South of the Pleistocene ice. The bird's morphology, including its plumage, is also consistent across its range. However, there are evidence showing that some Hammond's flycatcher on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, have evolved longer, thicker bills in the absence of Western flycatchers, which occupy a very similar niche but usually has a thicker bill than the Hammond's flycatcher. The Hammond's, the Dusky and the Gray flycatchers are sister species, with no evidence of interbreeding.\n\nThe Hammond's flycatcher is a migratory species, breeding in Western North America and wintering in Mexico and Central America.\n\nTheir preferred breeding habitats are mature coniferous and mixed forests. They are typically found in dense fir forests, conifer and aspen forests and dogwood. Their habitats on wintering grounds are similar to the ones used as breeding grounds.\n\nHammond's flycatchers can be found in the Western United States, including Montana, Wyoming, California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. In Canada, their range include British Columbia, Yukon and Alberta. Certain birds have been found as far North as Alaska. Overall, their breeding range is formed by regions that have been greatly influenced by past glaciation events. These birds are migratory and winter in Mexico and in Central America.\n\nThe song is a multi versed hoarse \"ssilit\", \"greeep\", \"silit\", \"pweet\". The call is a sharp\" peek\".\n\nHammond's flycatchers do not sing during the fall migration or on wintering grounds. They start singing in early May, shortly after their arrival on breeding grounds. The frequency of the song is usually higher at the beginning of the mating season and drops as summer progresses; males that do not have a partner sing more often and at a higher frequency than paired males.\n\nLike in other species of the genus \"Empidonax\", bill snapping and mandibles clicking are commonly used in a threatening context.\n\nTheir favorite preys include beetles, flies, bees, butterflies and moths, with a mean length of 5.7 mm and a mean weight of 1.656 mg. True beetles, and net-winged insects can also be part of their diet. They wait on an open perch high or in the middle of a tree and fly out to catch insects in flight, (hawking), also sometimes picking insects from foliage while hovering, (gleaning).\n\nThese birds are believed to be monogamous and show no evidence of extra-pair copulation. Male Hammond's flycatcher physically fight at the beginning of the breeding season, locking themselves together in midair and fluttering to the ground. They tend to nest on high, small to medium sized branches of tall trees. They also prefer areas where they can be covered by leaves, on the northeast or southwest sides of trees. Finally, they prefer old-growth forest, with a minimum age of 80 to 90 years.\n\nThey make a cup nest on a fork in a tree. Females usually lay in early June three or four creamy white eggs, sometimes marked with small reddish-brown dots. The female incubates the eggs for about 15 days. The hatchlings are altricial; both the male and the female are responsible of feeding the young.\n\n", "id": "7734020", "categories": ["Empidonax", "Native birds of Western Canada", "Native birds of Alaska", "Native birds of the Western United States"], "title": "Hammond's flycatcher"}

It runs north-northwest from the Boulevard des Italiens to the Église de la Sainte-Trinité.\n\nIn the 17th century the \"chemin des Porcherons\" crossed a swampy piece of ground north of the \"porte Gaillon\", a city gate in the wall built during the reign of Louis XIII, leading to the village of Les Porcherons. It is called a \"chaussée\" because the marshy ground required raised construction that ran along the top of a sort of dyke.\n\nAt the rue de Provence it crossed the \"great sewer\" or , which was approximately two meters wide.\n\nUnder an ordinance dated 4 December 1720, the street was graded and resurveyed as a wider boulevard with a width of eight \"toises\" and extended to meet the grands boulevards to the south. This new boulevard stretched from the end of to Rue Saint-Lazare.\n\nThe frequent stays of Louis XV in Paris led to the building of splendid homes such as that of Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin, the Duke of Antin (1665–1736). Son of the marquise de Montespan, the duke was the superintendent of the Bâtiments du Roi, or buildings of the king. His residence faced this street and his name became associated with it as early as 1712.\n\nAt the intersection of the Boulevard des Capucines, stood the former \"hôtel de Montmorency\", which gave way to the \"Théâtre du Vaudeville\" in 1869, and then the Paramount Opéra cinema theater in 1927.

The barracks was built by the Duke of Biron in 1764. It gave the boulevard its name for some years. On 12 July 1789, a platoon of the French Guards saved its colonel, M. Duchâtelet, from popular riots.\nThe air was thought to be healthier to the north and west of Paris during the 18th century. That, and the higher ground, attracted the upper classes.

The consortium currently has over 40 adopters; key members behind the specification include Broadcom, Intel, LG, Panasonic, NEC, Samsung, SiBEAM, Sony, Philips and Toshiba. The founders intend the technology to be used for Consumer Electronic devices, PCs, and portable devices.\n\nThe specification was finalized in January 2008.\n\nThe WirelessHD specification is based on a 7 GHz channel in the 60 GHz Extremely High Frequency radio band. It allows either lightly compressed (proprietary wireless link-aware codec) or uncompressed digital transmission of high-definition video and audio and data signals, essentially making it equivalent of a wireless HDMI. First-generation implementation achieves data rates from 4 Gbit/s, but the core technology allows theoretical data rates as high as 25 Gbit/s (compared to 10.2 Gbit/s for HDMI 1.3 and 21.6 Gbit/s for DisplayPort 1.2), permitting WirelessHD to scale to higher resolutions, color depth, and range. The 1.1 version of the specification increases the maximum data rate to 28 Gbit/s, supports common 3D formats, 4K resolution, WPAN data, low-power mode for portable devices, and HDCP 2.0 content protection.\n\nThe 60 GHz band usually requires line of sight between transmitter and receiver, and the WirelessHD specification ameliorates this limitation through the use of beam forming at the receiver and transmitter antennas to increase the signal's effective radiated power, find the best path, and utilise wall reflections. The goal range for the first products will be in-room, point-to-point, non line-of-sight (NLOS) at up to 10 meters. The atmospheric absorption of 60 GHz energy by oxygen molecules limits undesired propagation over long distances and helps control intersystem interference and long distance reception, which is a concern to video copyright owners.\n\nThe WirelessHD specification has provisions for content encryption via Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) as well as provisions for network management. A standard remote control allows users to control the WirelessHD devices and choose which device will act as the source for the display.\n\nWirelessHD competes with WiGig in some applications. WiGig transmits in the same 60 GHz band used by WirelessHD.\n\n\n", "id": "7734064", "categories": ["Networking standards", "Telecommunications-related introductions in 2008", "Wireless networking"], "title": "WirelessHD"}

It continues to follow James T. \"Joker\" Davis through his Vietnam odyssey. The book was supposed to be the second of a \"Vietnam Trilogy\", but Hasford died before writing the third installment.\n\nThe novel begins sometime after \"The Short-Timers\" leaves off and is divided into three parts.\n\nHaving been demoted from Sergeant to Private, Joker is still at the Khe Sanh base, which is about to be abandoned by American Marines after withstanding a two-month siege. He believes most of his previous squad-mates are dead, even the seemingly indestructible Animal Mother. Joker blames their deaths on \"The Phantom Blooper\": an elusive enemy, supposedly American and armed with an M79 grenade launcher, who fights alongside the Viet Cong against his countrymen.\n\nJoker is still haunted by the memory of his friend Cowboy, who had been wounded and whom Joker mercy-killed in order to keep their squad from being cut down by a sniper. As a result, Joker's behavior has become increasingly erratic and violent. He sets up one of his squad-mates to be killed in an attempt to draw the Phantom Blooper out of hiding, then forces an inattentive Marine on guard duty to hold a live hand grenade with the pin out. Later, as the Viet Cong attempt to overrun the base, Joker splits his platoon sergeant's tongue with a straight razor.\n\nThe Marines turn back the attack, suffering heavy losses in the process. The next night, Joker ventures out in search of the Phantom Blooper, but is wounded by friendly fire and captured by the enemy.\n\nJoker has been living and working in a small Viet Cong village for over a year since his capture, waiting for a chance to escape. He has not been tortured or sent to a POW camp, and his captors have begun to trust him to some degree. In Joker's mind, his best chance is to fool them into believing he has converted to their cause, to accompany them on an attack against an American position, and then to make his escape when the shooting starts. As time passes, however, he begins to side increasingly with the Viet Cong, seeing them - the people he has been trained to kill - as ordinary human beings just like himself. When a team of Army soldiers arrives to rescue him, he is wounded in the ensuing firefight but manages to shoot down one of their choppers with a discarded M79 before passing out.\n\nJoker is sent to Yokosuka Naval Hospital in Japan for medical treatment and psychological counseling. He quickly makes it clear that he does not regret any of his actions as a Viet Cong captive, and he expresses his disgust and outrage at having been sent by his country to fight in a futile war. Despite initial threats of a court-martial for treason, he is eventually given a Section 8 discharge and sent home to the United States.\n\nUpon arriving in California, Joker finds that his squad radioman, Donlon, is alive, attending college, and protesting the war. Animal Mother, he also learns, was captured by the Viet Cong but escaped from a POW camp; he is still an active Marine. Joker and Donlon attend a demonstration that is quickly and forcefully broken up by the police, but Joker manages to slip away with the help of an ex-Marine cop who served with him at Khe Sanh. Next, Joker travels to Cowboy's home in Kansas, and has a brief and uneasy meeting with Cowboy's parents. Their son's body was never recovered from the jungle, and Joker chooses not to tell them that he mercy-killed Cowboy. Finally, Joker reaches his family's farm in Alabama, all the while feeling a growing disillusionment with the war and America. Deciding there is nothing left for him in the United States, and realizing that he has become the Phantom Blooper he was once obsessed with stopping, he sets out to return to Vietnam and his life among the Viet Cong villagers.\n\nThis sequel made less of an impact than \"The Short-Timers\" (1979), which was the basis for the film \"Full Metal Jacket\" (1987). (Some dialogue from \"The Phantom Blooper\" is also present in \"Full Metal Jacket\".) Nonetheless, \"The Phantom Blooper\" was highly regarded by reviewers. Before Hasford died in 1993, he had planned to continue Joker's story in a third novel.\n\nAccording to the Official Gustav Hasford Website maintained by Hasford's cousin, Jason Aaron, \"The Short-Timers\", \"The Phantom Blooper: A Novel of Vietnam\", and Hasford's third and last completed book, a noir detective novel titled \"A Gypsy Good Time\" (1992), are currently out of print. The texts of the two war novels and an excerpt of \"A Gypsy Good Time\" were publicly available at the website for at least a decade, but the site has since been redesigned, and Aaron, who manages the site, has stated he \"likely won't be reposting the novel\" there.\n\n", "id": "7734089", "categories": ["1990 American novels", "American autobiographical novels", "Vietnam War novels"], "title": "The Phantom Blooper"}

Behind her is a large body of water and above her is the moon.\n\nThe woman's seated position, in combination with the crescent moon, recalls the High Priestess card, and we find a link as well in this card's representation of the characteristic feminine strength of intuition. The woman's blindfold and the sea show a necessity to rely not on immediate stimuli but on deeper thoughts and feelings, that part of the unconscious mind that we call our higher self.\n\nHer seated position, when conceptually paired with the balanced swords and the blindfold, may also recall the Justice card. Yet here the concept of justice is not one of retribution, but of making decisions that are balanced, moral and that we trust to be harmonious within and without ourselves.\n\nUnlike the \"hoodwinked\" woman held captive on the Eight of Swords, this card depicts a woman in control. The scene and the discipline of her pose do more to suggest that she has placed the blindfold on herself, as is done in many cultures, ritualistically, to encourage reliance on the other senses (for example the use of blindfolds in martial arts). \n\nThe woman is blind in her situation, but she is safe, not only unafraid, but centered. She wields powerful weapons, but they are not held in a position that is threatening to her or anyone else. The moon and the sea reinforce this sense of calm and equanimity.\n\nThis is a card of meditation, not of action.

His playing career was not a bright one, as he reached his personal top from 1981 to 1983, playing in the Serie B with U.S. Foggia, where he spent most of his footballing time. He retired in 1989, after a season played with Fidelis Andria of Serie C2.\n\nRossi, a sports science graduate with honours, took his first coaching job in 1990, aged 29, at Torremaggiore, of Promozione league, immediately winning the championship. The next year he joined Foggia as youth coach. In 1993, Rossi signed for Salernitana of Serie C1, and led the team to a Serie B promotion. After an unlucky comeback to Foggia, and a sixth place in Pescara, Rossi returned to coach Salernitana in 1997, leading the team to its second Serie A promotion in history. Rossi guided the team in Serie A too, but was fired in March 1999, as he was unable to lead Salernitana out of the relegation positions.\n\nA troubled year in Genoa and a poor comeback to Pescara were followed by three seasons with Lecce. Rossi, appointed as Lecce's coach in February 2002, was not able to avoid relegation to Serie B, but led the team back to Serie A just the next season, and maintained a place in the division the next year. He left Lecce in 2004 to be replaced by his maestro Zděnek Zeman, who was head coach at Foggia during Rossi's times in leading its youth team.\n\nIn December 2004, Rossi replaced Andrea Mandorlini at the helm of Atalanta B.C., last-placed in Serie A. Despite all his efforts and numerous praises, Rossi was not able to let his team escape from relegation. He is right footed.\n\nDespite not saving Atalanta, his good efforts at the helm of the \"Dea\" club gained interest from Lazio, who appointed him as replacement for Giuseppe Papadopulo.\n\nHis time at Lazio has been a remarkable success for which he has aroused interest from many top Serie A clubs. Rossi guided Lazio to a surprising UEFA Cup place in the 2005–2006 season, only for the place to be lost as part of the Calciopoli scandal that rocked the country in the summer of 2006. Even more remarkable, however, was Rossi's feat the following season. Despite an initial 11-point points deduction (which was subsequently reduced to 3 on appeal), Rossi guided the \"biancocelesti\" to an unlikely third place Serie A finish and a place in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League. However, during the 2007–08 season, he led Lazio to a disappointing 12th-place finish.\n\nOn 13 May 2009, Rossi led Lazio to their first trophy since the Coppa Italia triumph in 2004. It was also a Coppa Italia victory, which came after a successful penalty shootout against Sampdoria. On 8 June 2009, Delio Rossi was announced to have left Lazio because of personal reasons allegedly linked to an unstable working relationship with chairman Claudio Lotito. He was replaced by Davide Ballardini.\n\nOn 23 November 2009, Rossi returned into management as new head coach of Palermo, replacing Walter Zenga at the helm of the \"rosanero\". He immediately managed to turn the fortunes of Palermo, guiding the Sicilians to quickly rise up the Serie A league table also thanks to surprise results such as two 2–0 away win against teams such as AC Milan and Juventus, and ending the season in fifth place with only one point behind fourth-placed Sampdoria who were admitted to the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round at the \"rosanero\"'s expense. He was consequently confirmed as head coach of Palermo for the 2010–11 season, during which he also guided the club in its 2010–11 UEFA Europa League campaign. Impressive results in the new season included another impressive win at Juventus' home, as well as his abilities in launching youngsters as Javier Pastore, Ezequiel Muñoz, Josip Iličić and Armin Bačinović.\n\nRossi was sacked on 28 February 2011 by club president Maurizio Zamparini following a record 0–7 home loss to Udinese; he was replaced by Serse Cosmi. However, Rossi returned at Palermo only four weeks later, after Cosmi's Palermo side was soundly defeated by Catania in the Sicilian derby later on 3 April. Following a surprising comeback, he led the club to the Coppa Italia final which the 3–1 defeat by Internazionale. During the pre-season, on 1 June 2011, Rossi resigned as Palermo manager by mutual consent with president Zamparini.\n\nOn 7 November 2011, Rossi returned into management as new head coach of Serie A club Fiorentina, replacing Siniša Mihajlović, dismissed because of poor results. Rossi's debut match as Fiorentina boss ended in a 0–0 home draw against incumbent champions Milan. Afterwards, Fiorentina lost 2–0 to Delio's former club Palermo. He later beat Empoli 2–1 in the Coppa Italia. In the following weeks, he put Fiorentina up to 10th place in Seria A after they beat Roma 3–0. The following games however saw Fiorentina dropping into the table down to 17th place at some point, and thus involved in the fight to escape relegation.\n\nRossi's time with Fiorentina ended in shocking fashion. On 2 May 2012, during a home game against 19th-placed Novara, Rossi decided to substitute Serbian striker Adem Ljajić in the 32nd minute with Fiorentina losing 0–2. The player sarcastically applauded the substitution as he left the pitch and further gave the coach a sarcastic thumbs up from the dugout, to which Rossi reacted by physically assaulting Ljajić, pushing the youngster from above, then jumping after him into the dugout while attempting to punch him.\nAfter the game (ended in a 2–2 draw), the club board announced to have immediately removed Rossi from his position due to his actions, with two games still to go in the league season. The incident also cost him a three-month ban from Italian football, effective from 3 May 2012.\n\nRossi was appointed head coach of Sampdoria in December 2012 to replace Ciro Ferrara, becoming the seventh coach to work with both Genoa and Sampdoria. During his coaching tenure with the club, Rossi helped the Blucerchiati avoid relegation at the end of the 2012–13 Serie A season. On 11 November 2013, Rossi was sacked from his post, with Sampdoria in 18th position in the Serie A table having earned just 9 points and won only twice in 12 Serie A matches during the 2013–14 Serie A season.\nSampdoria had lost its last three Serie A matches, including a 2–1 defeat at Fiorentina on the day of Rossi's dismissal. Rossi hinted after the Fiorentina defeat that ‘trust’ between himself and the club was becoming an issue. “If there is a time where you do not feel that the trust is there, you should not wait to see how things unfold. I am a man of the world and I think that if the confidence is there, then it is normal that one continues, but if it is not, then it is better to end the rapport regardless of the results,” he said.\nOn 4 May 2015, Rossi was named the new manager of Bologna in Serie B replacing Diego López. He guided Bologna to win the promotion playoffs, defeating Pescara in the finals, and was confirmed for the club's successive Serie A campaign.\n\nHe was sacked by Bologna on 28 October 2015 after a string of negative results.\n\nOn 4 August 2017, Rossi was announced as the new head coach of Bulgarian club Levski Sofia. He was presented at a press conference a few days later, on 8 August 2017. After a string of 6 matches without victory, losing the final of the Bulgarian Cup and also a shock exit from Europa League at the hands of FC Vaduz, Rossi was released by mutual consent on 25 July 2018.\n\nOn 24 April 2019, he was appointed Palermo manager.\n\nCoppa Italia:\n\n\nBulgarian Cup:\n", "id": "7734097", "categories": ["Serie A managers", "S.S.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7734108", "text": "Napa Valley AVA\n\nNapa Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Napa County in California's Wine Country. Napa Valley is considered one of the premier wine regions in the world. Records of commercial wine production in the region date back to the nineteenth century, but premium wine production dates back only to the 1960s.\n\nThe combination of Mediterranean climate, geography and geology of the region are conducive to growing quality wine grapes. John Patchett established the Napa Valley's first commercial vineyard in 1858. In 1861 Charles Krug established another of Napa Valley's first commercial wineries in St. Helena. Viticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including an outbreak of the vine disease phylloxera, the institution of Prohibition, and the Great Depression. The wine industry in Napa Valley recovered, and helped by the results of the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, came to be seen as capable of producing the best quality wine – equal to that of Old World wine regions. Napa Valley is now a major enotourism destination.\n\nThe valley floor is flanked by the Mayacamas Mountain Range on the western and northern sides the Vaca Mountains on the eastern side. Several smaller valleys exist within these two ranges. The floor of the main valley gradually rises from sea level at the southern end to above sea level at the northern end in Calistoga at the foot of Mount Saint Helena. The Oakville and Rutherford American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) lie within a geographical area known as the Rutherford Bench in the center of the valley floor. The soil in the southern end of the valley consists mainly of sediments deposited by earlier advances and retreats of San Pablo Bay while the soil at the northern end of the valley contains a large volume of volcanic lava and ash. Several of the small hills that emerge from the middle of the valley floor near Yountville are indicators of the region's volcanic past.\n\nSeveral mesoclimates exist within the area due to various weather and geographical influences. The open southern end of the valley floor is cooler during the growing season due to the proximity of San Pablo Bay while the sheltered, closed northern end is often much warmer. The eastern side of the valley tends to be more arid because winter storms tend to drop much more precipitation on the western mountains and hills.\n\nEarly pioneer and settler George C. Yount is generally credited to have been the first to grow grapes in the Napa Valley. In 1864, on the marriage of one of his granddaughters to Thomas Rutherford, Yount gave the couple around of land, which Rutherford dedicated to winemaking.\n\nCommercial production started in 1858, with John Patchett selling wine for $2 per gallon. His wine cellar, built in 1859, narrowly predates that established in 1861 in St. Helena by Charles Krug, although this is commonly cited as the Napa Valley's first winery.\n\nCaptain Gustave Niebaum established Inglenook Winery in 1879 near the village of Rutherford. This was the first Bordeaux style winery in the USA. Inglenook wines won gold medals at the 1889 World's Fair in Paris.\n\nIn 1868 H. W. Crabb bought land near Oakville close to the Napa River. Crabb established a vineyard and winery named To Kalon, and by 1877 had planted and was producing 50,000 US gallons of wine per year. Crabb experimented with over 400 grape varieties to find the types best suited for the area.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century there were more than one hundred and forty wineries in the area. Of those original wineries, several still exist in the valley today including Beaulieu, Beringer, Charles Krug, Chateau Montelena, Far Niente, Mayacamas, Markham Vineyards, and Schramsberg Vineyards.\n\nViticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Phylloxera louse killed many of the vines throughout the valley. Prohibition, enacted in 1920, caused many wineries to shut down. A few remained open with agreements to produce sacramental wine. Growers who elected to keep their vines planted sold their crops to home winemakers. The Great Depression slowed the wine business further. These events stalled the growth of the wine industry in Napa County, California for years.\n\nAndré Tchelistcheff is generally credited with ushering in the modern era of winemaking in California. Beaulieu hired Tchelisticheff in 1938. He introduced several techniques and procedures to the region, such as aging wine in small French Oak barrels, cold fermentation, vineyard frost prevention, and malolactic fermentation.\nFollowing Prohibition, Beringer Vineyards invited attendees of the Golden Gate International Exposition to visit the winery using promotional maps printed with the phrase \"All roads lead to Beringer\" in 1939. The winery also invited Hollywood stars including Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Carole Lombard to visit. These early promotions are considered to be the birth of wine-based tourism that is now a large part of the economy of Napa Valley today.\n\nBrother Timothy of Christian Brothers winery was also instrumental in establishing the modern wine industry in Napa. After an earlier career as a teacher, he transferred to the order's Mont La Salle located on Mount Veeder in the Mayacamas Mountains northwest of Napa in 1935 to become the wine chemist for the order's expanding wine operations. Christian Brothers had grown grapes and made sacramental wine in Benicia, California during Prohibition, but decided to branch out into commercial production of wine and brandy after the repeal of Prohibition. The science teacher was a fast learner and soon established Christian Brothers as one of the leading brands in the state's budding wine industry. Brother Timothy's smiling face in advertisements and promotional materials became one of the most familiar images for wine consumers across the country. Following the Second World War, the wine industry in Napa began to thrive again.\n\nIn 1965, Napa Valley icon Robert Mondavi broke away from his family's Charles Krug estate to found his own winemaking operation in Oakville. It was the first new large scale winery to be established in the valley since prohibition and included the original To Kalon land. After this, the number of wineries in the valley grew rapidly, as did the region's reputation.\n\nIn 1976, the region got a boost from the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, which featured a Napa Valley Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon besting several famous French labels in a blind tasting format. The results of this tasting cemented the region's reputation as a producer of world class wines.\n\nA modern outbreak of phylloxera was discovered in the valley in 1983 in a vineyard planted with AxR1 rootstock. Many growers seized upon this outbreak as an opportunity to switch to varieties that were better suited to the climate and soil. By the late 1990s nearly 75% of the affected vineyards had been replanted with phylloxera resistant rootstock. The growers in the region are currently channeling their energy to battle the Glassy-winged sharpshooter, a non-native pest that carries Pierce's disease.\n\nA trend of larger national and international companies like E & J Gallo Winery, Diageo and Constellation Brands buying smaller wineries, vineyards and brands began to gain momentum in the early part of the 21st century. Today Napa Valley features more than 450 wineries that grow grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Merlot, Zinfandel, among others. While winemakers may produce wines from specific AVAs within the valley, many wines are made as a blend from grapes grown on the valley floor and the surrounding hillsides. \n\nAlmost 4.5 million people visit Napa Valley each year, making it a very popular tourist destination in California, and \"The World's Best Wine and Food Destination\" as awarded by TripAdvisor's 2010 Travelers' Choice Awards.\n\nWithin the Napa Valley AVA, there are sixteen sub-AVAs:\n\n\n", "id": "7734108", "categories": ["Napa Valley", "American Viticultural Areas", "American Viticultural Areas of the San Francisco Bay Area", "Wineries in Napa Valley", "Tourist attractions in Napa County, California", "Geography of Napa County, California"], "title": "Napa Valley AVA"}

Its name comes from underground hot springs which filter up through the sand between the high and low water tidal reaches. The beach is a popular destination both for locals and tourists visiting New Zealand. Annual visitor numbers have been estimated at 700,000, making it one of the most popular geothermal attractions in the Waikato Region.\n\nWithin two hours either side of low tide, it is possible to dig into the sand allowing hot water to escape to the surface forming a hot water pool. The water, with a temperature as hot as 64 °C (147 °F), filters up from two underground fissures located close to each other. These natural springs can be found on the beach opposite the off-shore rocks. Visitors often dig large holes and relax and soak in the thermal water. Many visitors bring a spade and bucket with them. Spades can also be hired from the nearby surf shop.\n\nCare needs to be exercised as the location of the hot springs are not far from the sea even at low tide, and visitors may be caught unaware by the large breaking waves. Hot Water Beach is known for its dangerous rip currents, holes and large waves. Signs at the beach advise swimmers not to swim within 50m either side of the off-shore rocks (opposite the springs), and to only swim between the flags of the Hot Water Beach Lifeguard Service are on patrol. Hot Water Beach's rip currents have claimed the lives of several unwary visitors and only strong and experienced swimmers are advised to enter the water.\n\n", "id": "7734119", "categories": ["Hot springs of New Zealand", "Beaches of New Zealand", "Thames-Coromandel District"], "title": "Hot Water Beach"}

It is named after the crater Ariadaeus, which marks its eastern end. It is over 300 km long and is categorized as a straight rille because of its linear nature. \n\nSome scientists think that the linear rilles might have formed after large impact events, while others believe that the rilles were formed as a surface manifestation of deep-seated dike systems when the Moon was still volcanically active. Rima Ariadaeus is thought to have been formed when a section of the Moon's crust sank down between two parallel fault lines (making it a graben or fault trough). Rima Ariadaeus shows no trace of associated volcanism and is thus considered to be an end member of the sequence where only pure faulting is involved i.e. a linear rille.\n\nThe ridges crossing the rille trough of Rima Ariadaeus and the surrounding plains units have been offset by the trough, proving that the ridges are older than the faults. Some craters are cut off by the faults and are, therefore, older. Other craters lie on the wall of the trough and are younger than the faulting. The faulting must be relatively young because so few craters appear to be younger than the faults, and because the edges of the trough appear to be crisp and little affected by slumping and other mass wasting.\n\nApollo mission photographs of the Rima Ariadaeus revealed a 300 km-long rift line on the surface of the moon. On being asked in 2010 about Internet suggestions that this was proof of the Quranic story, NASA scientist Brad Bailey said, \"My recommendation is to not believe everything you read on the internet. Peer-reviewed papers are the only scientifically valid sources of information out there. No current scientific evidence reports that the Moon was split into two (or more) parts and then reassembled at any point in the past.\"\n\nThe splitting of the moon was reportedly a miracle attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It is perhaps alluded to in the Quranic verses 54:1-2.\n", "id": "7734122", "categories": [], "title": "Rima Ariadaeus"}

Although originally enlisting as a private, he was the first African-American soldier promoted to commissioned rank, as a line officer, in that conflict, as evidenced by the U.S. War Department's initial refusal of that promotion due to his \"African descent.\"\n\nSwails was a free black who was so light in coloring that he was often mistaken as white. He was single and employed mostly as a waiter in Cooperstown, New York, at the start of the Civil War, and although he fathered several children by Sarah Thompson, they never married. His enlistment papers state he was employed as a boatman in Elmira, New York when he joined the army. In 1863, he answered Frederick Douglass' call to arms and joined the 54th Massachusetts when it began forming, and served in that regiment, eventually being commissioned as an officer, until the end of the war. After the war, he settled in South Carolina and later Washington, D.C., becoming a lawyer and politician.\n\nStephen Swails was a member of the 54th Massachusetts, enlisting and then rising through the ranks to receive a commission. He joined Company F of the 54th on 23 April 1863 and was soon appointed the company's first sergeant. Due to the loss of men in the assault on Fort Wagner, and when Colonel Edward Hallowell assumed command of the 54th, Swails was appointed acting sergeant-major of the 54th on 12 November 1863.\n\nIn early 1864, the regiment was posted to Florida as part of General Truman Seymour's expedition. On 20 February, while still performing duty as the regiment's sergeant-major, Swails was wounded in the head at the Battle of Olustee. Setting out toward the Union supply point at Sanderson, he soon fell unconscious on the road, but was placed on a cart by one of the 54th's officers. On 26 February 1864, Colonel Hallowell,\n...In accordance with the desire of his officers as well as his own... recommended to Governor Andrew that Sergeant Swails be commissioned in recognition of many soldiery qualities and his gallantry at Olustee. \nOn 26 March 1864, the regiment received a list of promotions approved by Governor Andrew, one of which was Swails' promotion to 2nd lieutenant. Thus began the fight to secure for Stephen Swails what may have been the first commission as a line officer given to an African American in the Union Army.\n\nIn May 1864, while the regiment was posted on Morris Island, South Carolina, during the siege of Charleston, Swails' application to muster as a 2nd lieutenant with the regiment was refused by the War Department. The reason given was \"Lieutenant Swails' African descent.\" Colonel William Gurney, the post commander, ordered Swails to remove his officer's uniform and reassume duties as an enlisted man. However, Colonel Hallowell obtained a furlough for Swails and sent him, along with all the necessary paperwork, to Major General John Foster, commander of the Department of the South. Once there, Lieutenant Swails presented his case, and received General Foster's recommendation, which was forwarded to higher authority. Lieutenant Swails then returned to duty with the regiment. In addition to correspondence between the Department of the South, Governor Andrew and the War Department, Lieutenant Swails also received a furlough to travel to Washington to present his own case. He then returned to duty. Finally, on 17 January 1865, orders were received from the War Department, authorizing Stephen Swails to muster as a 2nd lieutenant with the regiment, ending almost a year-long struggle on his behalf by Colonel Hallowell, Governor Andrew and the officers of the 54th. During this period, Swails continued to perform his duties as a line officer in Company D and participated in numerous actions.\n\nOn 11 April 1865, near Camden, South Carolina, Lieutenant Swails was wounded for a second time. While the 54th was on reconnaissance near a railroad junction, several locomotives, one with the steam up, were observed after dark. A detachment led by Lieutenant Swails rushed the trains and captured them. As Lieutenant Swails entered the cab of one locomotive, he waved his hat in triumph. This action drew the attention of the sharpshooters that he had deployed to shoot the trainmen if they tried to escape. Mistaking him for a white engineer, they fired at and wounded him.\n\nSecond Lieutenant Swails was promoted to 1st lieutenant on 28 April 1865 and discharged on 20 August 1865, when the regiment mustered out at Boston.\n\nAfter the war, Swails worked as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau, practiced law in the South, and became active in the political life of South Carolina. He married Susan Aspinall, a mixed-race Charlestonian, who bore him three children, Irene, Stephen Jr. and Florine. (Because Sarah Thompson bore him a son named Stephen Jr., he had two children with that name.) He was the mayor of Kingstree, where he lived from 1868 to 1879. He served as a state senator for ten years (1868–1878), including three terms as president pro tem.\n\nSwails was a delegate to the 1868, 1872 and 1876 Republican national conventions. He became a member of the U.S. Electoral College, and also edited a newspaper, the \"Williamsburg Republican\".\n\nHe was forced out of politics after Reconstruction. After a white mob tried to assassinate him, he resigned from office and, through his Republican connections, obtained jobs in Washington, D.C. with the U.S. Postal Service and the United States Treasury Department.\n\nStephen Swails is buried in the Friendly Society Cemetery, Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nBecause of his complicated private life, Stephen Swails' descendants are plentiful, and live in Toronto, upstate New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta.\n\nOne of his surviving grandchilden was James Swails Sr., of Rochester, New York, who died in 2004. His granddaughter, Carolyn Janet Rollins, and another grandson, Robert Swails, are also deceased. Caroline Janet Rollins was a counselor in New Jersey. She married Joseph Tyler Jefferson. They have eight surviving children. Robert Swails Rollins was a Doctor of Internal Medicine, graduated from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. He had two sons and a daughters and lived on Long Island, New York.

In many countries around Europe it is used as a game card. This card has the numerical value of nine.\n\nIn many countries Tarot cards are believed to tell the future, or have a divination usage. In these countries it is a very negative sign to have this card be turned. It is believed that it being turned can be instigated by others, as it might be coming up to show that one has been cruel to someone nearby.\n\nThis card has a lot to do with someone's mind and their doubts and pain. The card shows a person, most often a woman, lying down or sitting up but they are or were sleeping. When this card is reversed it can be about real or imagined doubts or pain, just as dreams can be about real or imagined parts of our life. Most often the person on the card is on a bridge symbolizing a person between the worlds of dreaming and reality or also the worlds of life and death.\n\nAbove the person lies their fears, hanging above them in an airy or dreamy way; this can be represented through demons, devils or even a heavily agitated night sky. Often there are sharp objects such as swords or knives, representing that a persons fears may pierce or stab through them. The swords could also mean that they are there to help the person cut through their own difficulties.\n\nIf this card is shown in an upright position, it can mean deception, premonitions and bad dreams, suffering and depression, cruelty, disappointment, violence, loss and scandal. However, all of these may be overcome through faith and calculated inaction. This is the card of the martyr and with it comes new life out of suffering.\n\nThis card can represent being plagued by fear, guilt, doubt, and worries that are to a large extent, unfounded. Chances are the person in question is dealing with a problematic situation or a difficult decision, but his or her worst fear is unlikely to materialize.\n\nIf the card is shown in an ill-dignified or reversed manner then it has a different meaning. When turned this way it means distrust, suspicion, despair, misery or malice. Total isolation away from comfort and help: institutionalization, suicide, imprisonment and isolation. However, in a generally positive spread, the reversed meaning of this card can also indicate that the nightmare may be ending. The Nine of Swords reversed can actually be a hopeful card, counseling faith in the future and the promise of better days ahead.\n", "id": "7734381", "categories": ["Suit of Swords"], "title": "Nine of Swords"}

He was later found hanging from a pedestrian footbridge. Officials found a suicide note and later ruled his death a suicide. His sacrifices were praised by several democracy activists.\n\nAt 6 am, Saturday 30 September 2006, Nuamthong drove his taxi, spray painted with the words \"[CDR is] destroying the country,\" and \"Sacrificing life\", into an M41 Walker Bulldog tank at Bangkok's Royal Plaza. Nuamthong was severely injured and taken to a police station nearby. \"I did it intentionally to protest the junta that has destroyed our country, and I painted all the words myself,\" noted Nuamthong to reporters from his bed at Vachira Hospital.\n\nNuamthong was charged with damaging state property. Authorities downplayed the incident, saying that Nuamthong was drunk and no messages were sprayed on the taxi. However, several newspapers reported on the legibility of the words painted on the car. Akkara Thiproj, deputy spokesperson for the military junta, expressed scepticism about Nuamthong's intentions in crashing into the tank, and claimed that \"Nobodies’ ideals are so great that they would sacrifice their lives for them.\"\nHe was released from the hospital on 12 October, and attended the 33rd anniversary of the 14 October 1973 democratic uprising.\n\nNuamgthong's body was found hanging, with a hood covering his face, from a footbridge on Vibhavadi Rangsit road near the headquarters of Thai Rath newspaper in Bangkok on 1 November 2006. Police ruled the death a suicide after forensic tests were stated to have shown no traces of a physical assault or struggle. Although Nuamthong's body was found with a suicide note, family members testified that he had given no hint of being depressed or about to commit suicide. Nuamthong wore a black T-shirt with a drawing of the Democracy Monument and a poem about the power of the masses. Newspaper clippings about his crash into the army tank were also found on his body. His wife, Boonchu, said he had given no farewells or done anything that would suggest he was planning to kill himself.\n\nHis wife noted, \"I couldn't be more sad losing the love of my life and the leader of my family. I didn't think he would be this brave, but I'm very proud of him for sacrificing for the country.\"\n\nFuneral rites were held at Wat Bua Kwan in Nonthaburi's Muang district. A score of senior police showed up at his funeral at Wat Bua Kwan in Nonthaburi to \"keep the peace\" while pro-democracy groups sent representatives and flower wreaths to honour his death.\n\nHis wife later attempted to transport his coffin to the 14 October 1973 Memorial on Ratchadamnoen road for bathing rituals. Police prevented her van from arriving at the Memorial.\n\nAbout 200 people attended the second night of Nuamthong's funeral at Wat Bua Kwan. Among them were military and police officers, politicians from the Thai Rak Thai Party and National Human Rights Commissioner Jaran Dithapichai. Sant Hathirat read a statement declaring Nuamthong a \"democracy martyr.\"\n\nHe was also praised by activist and former senator Prateep Ungsongtham Hata, who noted, \"Uncle Nuamthong has made the biggest sacrifice for democracy. I fought for democracy all my life but don't have the courage to do as much as he did.\"\n\nJunta deputy spokesperson Akara Tipparoj apologised for his earlier claim that nobody would hurt themselves for political ideals and claimed he planned to attend the funeral.\n\nThe Young People for Democracy Movement (YPD) condemned Akara's views as ignorant and noted that \"His remark is an insult, as Thailand has a long history of people dying to defend democracy from dictatorship.\"\n\nPrime Minister General Surayud Chulanont said he was saddened by the news but doubted there would be copycat suicide attempts.\n\nAfter his death, an interview Nuamthong had earlier given was partially aired by iTV. The broadcast came to an abrupt end after the Director of Army-owned Channel 5 called to give a warning.

It is one of the twelve schools in the Chaffey Joint Union High School District.\n\nIn 1882, founders of the City of Ontario George and William Chaffey established the Chaffey College of Agriculture and an on-campus secondary school with assistance from the University of Southern California (USC). The local community was granted control of the secondary school in 1901 and named it Ontario High School. Ten years later, in 1911, the school was renamed to Chaffey High School.\n\nIn 1967, a campus south of Chaffey High School was named Ontario High School.\n\nThe Ontario Jaguars' rival school is the Chaffey Tigers; their annual football game is known as \"The Cat Bowl\".\n\nIn 2014 the school was remodeled to include a modernized campus, a new two story building with 32 classrooms, and, for the first time in 47 years, a football stadium known as \"Jaguar Stadium\".\n\nThe current principal is Eduardo Zaldivar, preceded by Cary Willborn. OHS is currently the last high school with lockers in the Chaffey Joint Union High School District.\n\nOntario High School was built on of land on the south side of Ontario, California. The campus has eight permanent classroom buildings, along with 34 portable classrooms, for a total of 110 separate classrooms, an auditorium, cafeteria and multi-purpose room, library, gym, locker room facilities, two pools, and fine arts and vocational facilities. In 2014, an extensive modernization took place with the help of \"Measure P\", constructing a new campus, a 2 story building, solar panels in the parking lot, and a new stadium in which the school will be able to host its first home football games.\n\nOntario High School follows a standard California high school curriculum as defined by the California Department of Education's High School Graduation Requirements and tests students with the Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) program and the California High School Exit Exam.\n\nStudents have the opportunity to earn college credit through College Board Advanced Placement (AP) courses. In addition, Ontario High School has many honors classes, supports the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program and the National Honors Society, and participates in the nationwide Renaissance program.\n\nOntario High School supports a wide array of fine and performing arts including art, art history, music appreciation, drama, choir, dance, band, percussion, ceramics, and color guard classes.\n\nOntario High School's instrumentalists, percussionists, and color guard performers compete in the Southern California Judging Association (SCJA) circuit for marching season during the first three months of the academic year. For the remainder of the year the Color Guard competes as a \"winter guard\" against other guards while the instrument and percussion sections have their orchestral season. The band's major performances are the Holiday Showcase, Music Americana, and Pops! concerts. The Music Americana concert is unique because the band performs with the United States Marine Corps Band. The Color Guard also has several acts during the Holiday Showcase, the Pops! concerts, and their end of the year show, the Color Guard Spectacular.\nFor most of its history, the marching season group was known as the Ontario High School Jaguar Band and Color Guard. They won many awards in band tournaments and marched in several parades throughout southern California. At a point between 2000 and 2008, the group was renamed the Ontario High School Pride.\n\nOn November 1, 2008 the Ontario High School Pride entered the Surf City Open marching competition and won the highest \"sweepstakes\" awards and an invitation to the 2nd Annual California State Championship. This is the first time in its history that the combined marching band, percussion, and color guard competed in a state level competition. On November 22, 2008 the Ontario High School Pride won the 5A Division of the California State Championships for their performance titled \"The Lion King Goes Broadway\" and became the 2008 Division 5A California State Champions.\n\nLong-time band director Dave Berry retired at the close of the 2008-2009 school year. Ontario High School hired alumni Elyse Doremus to replace him and carry on his legacy in the 2009-2010 school year. \n\nThe school's dance classes—Dance Fundamentals, Core 2, Dance production and Dance Company—perform an end-of-the-year show to songs such as Bad Romance by Lady Gaga, Heads Will Roll by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Fuego by The Cheetah Girls, We Got the Beat by The Go-Gos, Street Lights by Kanye West, Hush Hush by The Pussycat Dolls, Send Me On My Way by Rusted Root, The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson, Scars by Kelis, What's This from Nightmare Before Christmas, and I Took the Night by Chelly.\n\nThe school's drama productions were formerly directed by Mr. Hansen and Mr.Mascio, but are now being directed by Jessica Larson. Past performances include Rumors, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Nerd, Touchtone \"M\" for Murder, Night of the Living Dead, Little Shop of Horrors, Alice in Wonderland, and Area 51 the Musical, The Brothers Grimm Spectaculathon and You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.. For the 2011-2012 school year the productions are The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Abridged. Ontario High School is currently doing Seussical The Musical. Due to debut on February 23–26, 2017 at 7pm with an understudy show on February 25 at 2pm. There are 2 matinee performances on February 25 & 26 at 2pm.\n\nThe theater, built in the 1960s, seats about 1200. There is no fly space as it has a shared roof with the gymnasium. Starting in 2012, the theater will be going through a small face lift to restore the venue to its former beauty.\n\nOntario High School is committed to providing students a clean and safe environment which fosters learning and promotes student responsibility and citizenship.\n\nThe Ontario High School student population is primarily Hispanic/Latino. Between 2005 and 2009, the number of students categorized as English Language Learners decreased slightly. During the same period came a sharp rise in the number of students participating in the Free/Reduced School Lunch program. This data is reported by the school district as part of their annual California Basic Educational Data System (CBEDS) submission. Enrollment figures are released annually by the California Department of Education.\n\nStudent Enrollment: 2,841\nFree/Reduced School Lunch: 55.9%\nSocioeconomic Disadvantaged: 75.8%\nEnglish Language Learners: 26.4%\nCensus Characterization: Mid-size City\nEthnic Breakdown:\nAmerican Indian/Alaskan Native: 0.2%\nAsian: 2.4%\nPacific Islander: 0.4%\nFilipino: 0.5%\nHispanic/Latino: 85.8%\nAfrican American: 4.2%\nWhite: 6.1%\nOther/Declined to State: 0.5%\n\nStudent Enrollment: 2,591\nFree/Reduced School Lunch: 17.3%\nEnglish Language Learners: 29.8%\nCensus Characterization: Mid-size City\nEthnic Breakdown:\nAmerican Indian/Alaskan Native: 0.3%\nAsian: 2.7%\nPacific Islander: 0.3%\nFilipino: 0.7%\nHispanic/Latino: 77.6%\nAfrican American: 6.5%\nWhite: 10.7%\nOther/Declined to State: 1.2%\n\nStudents and faculty members often work together to form clubs that serve the community and participate in extra-curricular activities.\n\n\nOntario High School holds dances including homecoming, prom, and Sadie Hawkins dance. Homecoming Dance themes include \"Around the World in One Night\" and \"Circue Du Extravaganza.\" A recent Prom theme is \"Midnight Masquarade.\" OHS has recently had its 5th annual Halloween Carnival in 2013. The staff and students from different clubs bring fun carnival games and also a variety of different foods they sell. Main event at the carnival is the 2 scary mazes, one is hosted in the OHS auditorium, and the second maze is hosted in building A. This event is open for all age groups.\n\nLike many high schools throughout Southern California, Ontario High School has its share of notable faculty and alumni.\n\n\n", "id": "7734484", "categories": ["Educational institutions established in 1967", "High schools in San Bernardino County, California", "Public high schools in California"], "title": "Ontario High School (California)"}

These teams are referred to as the Tulsa Golden Hurricane (or variously as TU or Tulsa). Before adopting the name Golden Hurricane in 1922, the University of Tulsa (TU) had many unofficial team nicknames including Kendallites (from TU's predecessor institution Henry Kendall College), Presbyterians (from the university's founding by the Presbyterian Church), Tulsans, Tigers, Orange and Black, and Yellow Jackets. The name \"Golden Tornadoes\" was chosen by TU football coach H.M. Archer (1922–24) based on new gold and black uniforms (rather than the previous orange and black) and a remark made during practice of the team \"roaring through opponents\" (during a season when TU went undefeated, including wins over Texas A&M and the University of Arkansas). However, it was quickly discovered that the same name had been chosen in 1917 by Georgia Tech. Archer then substituted the term \"hurricane\" for \"tornado\" and a team vote prior to leaving for the game against Texas A&M confirmed the official nickname as \"Golden Hurricane\".\n\nThe Tulsa Golden Hurricane is a member of the American Athletic Conference (The American). The Golden Hurricane were members of Conference USA from 2005 to 2014, winning 40 conference championships, including 16 postseason titles and nine regular season crowns (including three West Division titles). It's the most C-USA titles (Rice is second with 16) since the league re-aligned in 2005–06. It was a member of the Western Athletic Conference from 1996–2004 and the Missouri Valley Conference from 1935 to 1996. In 1985, the MVC dropped football so Tulsa participated as an Independent in football, but remained as an MVC member in other sports, including basketball. Prior to 1935, Tulsa was a member of several conferences.\n\nOn April 2, 2013, Tulsa announced that in July 2014 it would leave C-USA for the Big East Conference, which would rename itself the following day as the American Athletic Conference (The American).\n\nTulsa has won six national championships (three NCAA): four in women's golf and two in men's basketball. The University of Tulsa currently fields a varsity team in eight men's sports and ten women's sports.\n\nTulsa has the smallest undergraduate enrollment of all schools that participate in NCAA Bowl Sub-Division football. The football team is coached by Philip Montgomery, who was the Offensive Coordinator at Baylor for 7 years. He replaced Bill Blankenship who replaced Todd Graham who had replaced Steve Kragthorpe, who led the team to three bowl games in four seasons before accepting the head coaching job at the University of Louisville after the 2006–7 season. Graham, a former Tulsa defensive coordinator, returned to the team after serving as the head coach at Rice University for one season.\n\nTulsa has appeared in five bowl games between the 2003 and 2008 seasons, including four straight: the 2005 Liberty Bowl, 2006 Armed Forces Bowl, 2008 GMAC Bowl, and 2009 GMAC Bowl. Tulsa's football teams have appeared in a total of 16 bowl games and Tulsa was the first university to play in five straight New Year's Day bowl games: the 1942 Sun Bowl, 1943 Sugar Bowl, 1944 Sugar Bowl, 1945 Orange Bowl, and 1946 Oil Bowl. Tulsa football finished the 1991 season ranked 21st in the nation by the Associated Press and USA Today/Coaches polls. During the 2008 season Tulsa football was ranked as high as 19th nationally by the AP poll, and 18th in both the BCS rankings and USA Today/Coaches poll. Tulsa also led all Division I FBS schools in total offense in 2008 (7,978 yds) and in 2007 (7,832 yds). Tulsa football finished the 2010 season ranked 24th in the Associated Press poll and finished the 2012 season ranked 25th in the USA Today/Coaches poll.\n\nThe University of Tulsa has three Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees. Steve Largent and the late Jim Finks were members of the 1995 class, while Bob St. Clair was a 1990 inductee. TU shares the lead for the most NFL Hall of Famers among the Division I FBS football schools in the state of Oklahoma. The University of Tulsa can also take much of the credit for developing the passing game in collegiate football in the 1960s. Tulsa led the nation in passing in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1966. Quarterbacks Jerry Rhome (1964) and Billy Guy Anderson (1965) and receiver Howard Twilley (1964–65) set most of the NCAA passing and receiving records, some of which still stand today.\n\nThe Tulsa Golden Hurricane basketball program has had a history of success, including NIT championships in 1981 and 2001, an Elite Eight appearance in 2000, three Sweet Sixteen appearances, and 14 trips to the Big Dance. The Golden Hurricane have a long-standing basketball rivalry with Oral Roberts Golden Eagles. The two teams have exchanged a traveling trophy, the Mayor's Cup. Tulsa is also known for developing many coaches who have gone on to great success in the NCAA, including current Texas Tech men's basketball coach Tubby Smith, who won a national championship while he coached at the University of Kentucky, Kansas' Bill Self, and one of Arkansas' most notable former coaches, Nolan Richardson, who is the only head coach to win the NJCAA tournament (with Western Texas Junior College), the NIT (with Tulsa), and the NCAA tournament (with Arkansas). The current men's basketball head coach is Frank Haith.\n\nIn 2006, the Tulsa women's basketball team earned its first appearance in the NCAA tournament by winning Conference USA's regular-season and tournament championships. The Golden Hurricane's accomplishment came after back-to-back 19-win seasons and WNIT appearances in 2004 and 2005. Tulsa also appeared in the 2002 WNIT, making it to the second round.\n\nThe Tulsa Men's Soccer team has a strong history since it became a varsity sport in 1980. TU has won four conference championships (1991 MVC, 2007, 2008, 2009 C-USA) and eight conference tournaments (1991 MVC, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012 C-USA, 2014, 2015, 2016 AAC). Tulsa holds the NCAA record for both consecutive home wins and consecutive home games without a loss, set during the same stretch of 39 games from 1988 to 1992. The Golden Hurricane has twice reached the elite-eight of the NCAA Men's Soccer Championship, falling to eventual champion Indiana in 2004 and top seeded Akron in 2009. Tulsa has participated in 11 NCAA tournaments (1991, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016) and has been frequently ranked in the top 25. The school has produced first team All-American, Ryan Pore, who played for the Portland Timbers, and Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer. Terry Boss of Seattle Sounders FC and Lawson Vaughn of D.C. United are former Golden Hurricane currently playing in MLS. Dominic Cervi plays for Celtic F.C. of Glasgow, Scotland, and fellow goalkeeper Tyrel Lacey has signed with FC Lyn Oslo of Oslo, Norway. Since 1995, the head coach has been Tom McIntosh, a prominent figure in Tulsa soccer for over 20 years. The team plays in the Hurricane Soccer & Track Stadium.\n\nThe Golden Hurricane Tennis program has string of success, including men's Missouri Valley championships in 1995 and 1996, men's Conference USA championships in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011 and women's Conference USA championships in 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011. In 2007, Tulsa's top-ranked player Arnau Brugués-Davi ranked as high as #1 in the nation and a four time All-American, advanced to the quarterfinals of the singles competition at the NCAA Men's Tennis Championship, improving on his 2006 round of sixteen appearance. The University of Tulsa also boasts one of the nation's top tennis facilities, the Michael D. Case Tennis Center, which was host to the 2004 and 2008 NCAA tennis championships.\n\nTU has won four team national titles in women's golf: the 1980 and 1982 AIAW titles and the 1982 and 1988 NCAA titles, with the 1988 title later vacated. Golfers Nancy Lopez (1976), Kathy Baker (1982 AIAW), and Melissa McNamara (1988) have won individual national titles. Other notable Golden Hurricane female golfers are Stacy Prammanasudh and Kelly Robbins. The team has won 12 conference championships:\n\nThe men's golf team has won 11 conference championships:\n\nTulsa's baseball team played in the College World Series twice, finishing in second and third place. In 1969 the Golden Hurricane made it to the final game of the double-elimination tournament before losing to Arizona State. First baseman Steve Caves and third baseman Les Rogers were named to the all-tournament team. In 1971 Tulsa lasted until the next-to-last game of the tournament before being eliminated. First baseman Jerry Tabb was named the tournament's most valuable player; pitcher Steve Rogers and outfielder Steve Bowling were also named to the all-tournament team. Tulsa held the number one ranking in the polls for part of the 1972 season before being knocked out of that year's playoffs at the district level.\n\nOf the Tulsa baseball players who later played in the major leagues, the most successful was Steve Rogers, who pitched for 12 years with the Montreal Expos and was selected to five All-Star teams. Other Hurricanes who played in the majors included Bud Bloomfield, Steve Bowling, Mark Calvert, Mardie Cornejo, Mike Sember, and Jerry Tabb.\n\nTulsa dropped its baseball program in 1980, citing rising costs and the need to fund a full women's sports program. Gene Shell, who had coached the program from 1965 to 1980, finished his career at Tulsa with a 478–199 record, and was the fourth winningest coach in college baseball when the program ended. In recent years, the university has been reported on several occasions to be considering whether to restore the baseball program; a formal study was conducted in 2009 after the Tulsa Drillers moved into their new downtown stadium, leaving Drillers Stadium potentially available for college baseball, but the school concluded that the financial demands of adding a new sport were more than it could accept.\n\nThe Golden Hurricane softball team won Conference USA regular season and tournament championships in 2006 and 2009. The men's golf team won the Conference USA championship in 2007.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2009, Tulsa's mascot was \"Captain 'Cane\", an anthropomorphized golden hurricane with human attributes such as biceps, clothes, and a perpetual smirk. This representation of Captain 'Cane was named by Fox Sports as the second worst mascot in the country. From 1977 to 1994, the mascot was known as \"Hurc\" or \"Huffy\". In 2009, Captain Cane was redesigned as a human superhero with the power to summon weather.\n\nAs of July 2, 2015, Tulsa has 3 team national championships (one NCAA and two AIAW titles), all in women's golf. During the one year of overlapping dual NCAA and AIAW championships (1981-82), Tulsa was the only school to win both championships in one sport.\n\nTulsa has won one NCAA team national championship.\n\n\nSee also:\n", "id": "7734504", "categories": [], "title": "Tulsa Golden Hurricane"}

Built in 1975, the school now has over 1900 students and around 300 staff, and includes a large sixth form founded in 1978 of around 650 students.\n\nThe school is very popular and is currently oversubscribed, with some parents resorting to moving house into Sharnbrook's catchment area to guarantee their children a place at the school. Quite a sizeable proportion of sixth form students join the school in Year 12, having completed their compulsory education at other schools.\n\nMost students join the school in Year 7 where they are aged 10 to 11. They take GCSE exams, in year 11 (ages 15–16), after which some students will leave to attend a technical college or an alternative sixth form. Most, however, stay and join the sixth form (Years 12 and 13, ages 16–18+), where they are joined by a large number of students who have completed their GCSEs at other schools and have moved to Sharnbrook for their final two years at school.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2003 to 2004 academic year, Sharnbrook introduced vertical tutoring, a pastoral system in which each tutor group has students from each year group, from Year 9 to Year 13 (Upper Sixth). In contrast, almost all UK secondary schools organise their tutor groups \"horizontally\", with the school population divided primarily into National Curriculum year groups, and each form or tutor group has students from only one year group. The school's senior management now share their expertise in running a vertical system by running workshops and seminars for headteachers, senior managers and pastoral leaders from around the UK.\n\nTo accommodate the new vertical tutor groups, a House system was devised, comprising six houses, one of which every student is a member. Most of the staff are also assigned to a house. Each house contains fourteen tutor groups and is led by a \"Head of House\" and an \"Assistant Head of House\", titles which are sometimes abbreviated to HOH and AHOH, respectively. Traditional \"Heads of Year\" still exist, although their role has greatly diminished with the arrival of \"Heads of House\".\n\nThe houses are named after medieval manors of Sharnbrook village. The houses and their associated colours are displayed in the adjacent table.\n\n\nThe school hosted its own Farm onsite for many years (later an Animal Care Centre).\n\nIn late 2009 plans were confirmed for the construction of a new science centre, with construction due to begin early 2010. The centre was completed in November 2010. In 2011 there was a large project which included, but was not limited to, a new library (the Learning Hub), dining room (Dining 1) and another refurbished dining room (JDs).\n\nSharnbrook Upper School Media Department offers students the role of studio hands in the \"Broadcast Team\". The group is responsible for the running of the school broadcast system, which replaces the traditional whole school assembly. The broadcast is filmed, live, in a special television studio and gallery, situated in the heart of the media department.\n\nSharnbrook is a Training School, a Partnership Promotion School, a Beacon School and has received the Artsmark Gold and Sportsmark awards from the Arts Council England and Sport England, respectively. Previously Sharnbrook was granted specialist school status as a media Arts College.\n\nOn 1 February 2011, Sharnbrook Upper School formally gained academy status.\n\nThe school day begins at 8.30 am and ends at 3.15 pm.\nThe 2015/16 academic year saw the introduction of a reduced Tuesday (starting 8.30 am and finishing 2.45 pm) to allow teachers to cope with changing specifications.\n\nThe catchment area for Sharnbrook Upper School includes the parishes of Bletsoe, Bolnhurst and Keysoe, Carlton and Chellington, Clapham, Dean and Shelton, Felmersham and Radwell, Harrold, Knotting and Souldrop, Little Staughton, Melchbourne and Yielden, Sharnbrook, Stevington, Milton Ernest, Oakley, Odell, Pavenham, Pertenhall, Podington, Hinwick and Farndish, Thurleigh, Turvey, Riseley, Swineshead and Wymington.\n\nSharnbrook Upper School, along with its feeder middle and lower schools, form part of the North Bedfordshire Schools Trust (which itself was created out of the former Learning Community 7). 7 of the schools were awarded school trust statuses in April 2007, with further schools in the Sharnbrook catchment were also awarded trust status later in 2008. The schools in bold are middle schools, whose pupils move to Sharnbrook after \"Year 8\". Underneath each feeder middle school are the lower schools that feed them.

Channa later became a disciple of the Buddha and achieved arahantship, as is described in the 78th verse of the Dhammapada.\n\nChanna was a servant in the court of King Śuddhodana who was entrusted to attend to the needs of Siddhartha, who had been lavished and pampered in a series of purpose-built palaces in order to shield him from thoughts of pain and suffering. This was done due to a prophecy by the ascetic Asita, who predicted that Siddhartha would renounce the throne to become a spiritual leader were he to contemplate human suffering. Channa was the servant who served as the charioteer pulled by the horse Kanthaka, when Siddhartha saw the Four sights whilst meeting his subjects in the Sakya capital Kapilavastu, which prompted his decision to renounce the world.\n\nDuring these expeditions, Channa explained to Siddhartha the sights of an elderly man, a sick person, a dead person whose funeral was being conducted and finally, an ascetic who had renounced worldly life for a spiritual one, as Siddhartha who had been secluded from such sights within the palace was taken aback. Channa was later entrusted by Siddhartha to accompany him upon his escape from the palace to become an ascetic, whilst the remainder of the palace guards were asleep.\n\nAfter initially protesting and refusing to accept that Siddhartha would leave him, Channa saddled Kanthaka, guiding him out of the town aboard the horse to a forest by the edge of the Anoma River. Channa returned Siddhartha's acoutrements, weapons and hair to Suddhodarnha upon his return to the palace, after Siddhartha compelled him to return after Channa had refused to leave him.\n\nUpon Siddhartha's enlightenment as Gautama Buddha and return to Kapilavastu, Channa became a Buddhist monk, joining the Sangha. Due to his lone accompaniment of the Buddha on his renouncement, Channa behaved in an overbearing way to the other monks, and frequently criticized the two chief disciples Sariputta and Moggallana. In spite of continual advice from The Buddha he continued to abuse the other monks. Prior to the parinibbana, the Buddha instructed Ananda to impose the brahmadanda on Channa, whereby the other monks would simply ignore him. After the parinibbana, Channa learned of the decree, and feeling remorse for his behaviour, he fainted three times before asking and obtaining pardon. He eventually became an arahant.\n\n", "id": "7734561", "categories": [], "title": "Channa (Buddhist)"}
