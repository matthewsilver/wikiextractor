{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702313", "text": "Yoga Vasistha\n\nYoga Vasistha (, IAST: \"\") is a philosophical text attributed to Valmiki, although the real author is unknown. The complete text contains over 29,000 verses. The short version of the text is called \"Laghu Yogavasistha\" and contains 6,000 verses. The text is structured as a discourse of sage Vasistha to Prince Rama. The text consists of six books. The first book presents Rama's frustration with the nature of life, human suffering and disdain for the world. The second describes, through the character of Rama, the desire for liberation and the nature of those who seek such liberation. The third and fourth books assert that liberation comes through a spiritual life, one that requires self-effort, and present cosmology and metaphysical theories of existence embedded in stories. These two books are known for emphasizing free will and human creative power. The fifth book discusses meditation and its powers in liberating the individual, while the last book describes the state of an enlightened and blissful Rama.\n\nYoga Vasistha teachings are structured as stories and fables, with a philosophical foundation similar to those found in Advaita Vedanta, is particularly associated with \"drsti-srsti\" subschool of Advaita which holds that the \"whole world of things is the object of mind\". The text is notable for expounding the principles of Maya and Brahman, as well as the principles of non-duality, and its discussion of Yoga. The short form of the text was translated into Persian by the 15th-century.\n\nYoga Vasistha is famous as one of the historically popular and influential texts of Hinduism. Other names of this text are Maha-Ramayana, Arsha Ramayana, Vasiṣṭha Ramayana, Yogavasistha-Ramayana and Jnanavasistha.\n\nThe name Vasistha in the title of the text refers to Rishi Vasistha. The term Yoga in the text refers to the underlying Yogic theme in its stories and dialogues, and the term is used in a generic sense to include all forms of yoga in the pursuit of liberation, in the style of Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe long version of the text is called \"Brihat Yoga Vasistha\", wherein \"Brihat\" means \"great or large\". The short version of the text is called \"Laghu Yoga Vasishta\", wherein \"Laghu\" means \"short or small\". The longer version is also referred to simply as \"Yoga Vasistha\" and by numerous other names such as \"Vasiṣṭha Ramayana\".\n\nThe date or century of the text's composition or compilation is unknown, and variously estimated from the content and references it makes to other literature, other schools of Indian philosophies. Scholars agree that the surviving editions of the text were composed in the common era, but disagree whether it was completed in the first millennium or second. Estimates range, states Chapple, from \"as early as the sixth or seventh century, to as late as the fourteenth century\".\n\nThe surviving text mentions Vijnanavada and Madhyamika schools of Buddhism by name, suggesting that the corresponding sections were composed after those schools were established, or about 5th-century. The translation of a version of the text in 14th- to 15th-century into Persian, has been the basis of the other limit, among scholars such as Farquhar in 1922.\n\nAtreya in 1935 suggested that the text must have preceded Gaudapada and Adi Shankara, because it does not use their terminology, but does mention many Buddhist terms. Dasgupta, a contemporary of Atreya, states that the text includes verses of earlier text, such as its III.16.50 is identical to one found in Kalidasa's Kumarasambhava, thus the text must be placed after the 5th-century. Dasgupta adds that the philosophy and ideas presented in Yoga Vasistha mirror those of found in Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara, but neither mention the other, which probably means that the author(s) of Yoga Vasistha were scholars who lived in the same century as Shankara, placing the text in about 7th- to early 8th-century. The shorter summary version of the text is attributed to the Kashmiri scholar Abhinanda, who has been variously dated to have lived in 9th- or 10th-century.\n\nMainkar states that Yoga Vasistha probably evolved over time. The first work, states Mainkar, was the original ancient work of Vasistha that was an Upanishad with Brahamanical ideas, a work that is lost. This text was, suggests Mainkar, was expanded into \"Moksopaya\" in or after 6th-century, which is now commonly known as \"Laghu-Yogavasistha\". The \"Laghu\" (shorter) version was then expanded into the full editions, over time, in the centuries that followed the completion of \"Laghu-Yogavasistha\". The syncretic incorporation of Buddhism and Hinduism ideas happened in the \"Laghu-Yogavasistha\" edition, states Mainkar, while ideas from Kashmiri Shaivism, particularly the Trika school, were added to the growing version by the 12th-century. Similar serial expansion, revisions and interpolation is typical in Indian literature. Peter Thomi has published additional evidence in support Mainkar's theory on Yoga Vasistha's chronology.\n\nThe oldest surviving manuscript of the \"Moksopaya\" (or \"Moksopaya Shastra\") has been dated to have been composed in Srinagar in the 10th century AD.\n\nThe text is traditionally attributed to Valmiki, the author of Ramayana.\n\nThe author of the shorter version, the \"Laghu-Yogavasistha\", is generally considered to be Abhinanda of Kashmir.\n\nThe text exists in many editions of manuscripts with varying number of verses, but similar message. The full editions contain over 29,000, to a few with 32,000 verses, and in some editions about 36,000 verses. An abridged version by Abhinanda of Kashmir (son of Jayanta Bhatta) is \"Laghu\" (\"Little\") \"Yogavasistha\" and contains 6,000 verses.\n\nThe verses of Yoga Vasistha are structured in the genre of ancient Indian literature, called \"Grantha\". In this genre, each Shloka (verse) in the text is designed to equal 32 syllables, while conveying its message. A Grantha can be sung and depending on its meter, set to specific Raga music. This genre is found in Bhakti movement literature, and Yoga Vasistha's Advaita theories and monism influenced the Grantha literature of Sikhism, whose primary scripture is called \"Guru Granth Sahib\".\n\nThe \"Yoga Vasistha\" is a syncretic work, containing elements of Vedanta, Yoga, Samkhya, Saiva Siddhanta, Jainism and Mahayana Buddhism, thus making it, according to Chapple, \"a Hindu text \"par excellence\", including, as does Hinduism, a mosaic-style amalgam of diverse and sometimes opposing traditions\".\n\nThe text consists of six books:\n\nThe Nirnaya Sagar version of Yoga Vasistha manuscript has 1146 verses in the first Book, 807 in second, 6304 verses in third, 2414 verses in the fourth book, 4322 in the fifth, while the last is longest with 14296 verses, for a cumulative total of 29,289 verses.\n\nThis is one of the longest Hindu texts in Sanskrit after the \"Mahabharata\", and an important text of Yoga. It consists of numerous short stories and anecdotes used to help illustrate its ideas and message. The text shows the influence of Advaita Vedanta and Saivite Trika school. In terms of Hindu mythology, the conversation in the Yoga Vasishta is placed chronologically before the \"Ramayana\".\n\nThe traditional belief is that reading this book leads to spiritual liberation. The conversation between Vasistha and Prince Rama is that between a great, enlightened sage and a seeker of liberation. The text discusses consciousness, cosmology, nature of the universe and consciousness, the ultimate dissolution of body, the liberation of the soul and the non-dual nature of existence.\n\nThe Yoga Vasistha states that there are four characteristics that mark someone ready for spiritual journey who: \n\n\n\"Yoga Vasistha\" teachings are divided into six parts: dispassion, qualifications of the seeker, creation, existence, dissolution and liberation. It sums up the spiritual process in the seven \"Bhoomikas\":\n\nIn Chapter 2 of Book VI, titled as \"The story of Iksvaku\", the text explains the state of nirvana (liberation) as follows, \"Liberation is peace. Liberation is extinction of all conditioning. Liberation is freedom from every kind of physical, psychological and psychic distress. This world is not seen by the ignorant and the wise in the same light. To one who has attained self-knowledge, this world does not appear as samsara, but as the one infinite and indivisible consciousness\".\n\nThe Yoga Vasistha describes the \"Jivanmukta\", or liberated person, as follows (abridged from the 1896 translation by KN Aiyer):\n\nThe Yoga Vasistha describes samsara and reality as follows:\n\nThe following traditional Sanskrit commentaries on the Yoga Vasistha are extant:\n\n\"Yoga Vasistha\" is considered one of the most important texts of the Vedantic philosophy.\n\nThe text, states David Gordon White, has served as a reference on Yoga for medieval era Advaita Vedanta scholars. The Yoga Vasistha, adds White, was one of the popular texts on Yoga that dominated the Indian Yoga culture scene before the 12th-century.\n\nIndian freedom fighter Vinayak Damodar Savarkar has praised Yoga Vasistha. Quotes from his Autobiography \"My Transportation For Life\":\n\nThe practice of \"atma-vichara\", \"self-enquiry,\" described in the \"Yoga Vasistha\", has been popularised due to the influence of Ramana Maharshi, who was strongly influenced by this text.\n\nOriginally written in Sanskrit, the \"Yoga Vasistha\" has been translated into many Indian languages, and the stories are told to children in various forms.\n\n\nDuring the Mughal Dynasty the text was translated into Persian several times, as ordered by Akbar, Jahangir and Darah Shikuh. One of these translations was undertaken by Nizam al-Din Panipati in the late sixteenth century AD. This translation, known as the \"Jug-Basisht\", which has since became popular in Persia among intellectuals interested in Indo-Persian culture. The Safavid-era mystic Mir Findiriski (d. 1641) commented on selected passages of \"Jug-Basisht\".\n\nThe unabridged text is currently being translated into Russian and published by Swamini Vidyananda Saraswati, first five books are completed by 2017.\n\n\"Yoga Vasistha\" was translated into English by Swami Jyotirmayananda, Swami Venkatesananda, Vidvan Bulusu Venkateswaraulu and Vihari Lal Mitra. K. Naryanaswami Aiyer translated the well-known abridged version, \"Laghu-Yoga-Vasistha\". In 2009, Swami Tejomayananda's \"Yoga Vasistha Sara Sangrah\" was published by the Central Chinmaya Mission Trust. In this version the \"Laghu-Yoga-Vasistha\" has been condensed to 86 verses, arranged into seven chapters.\n\nYoga Vasistha was translated in 2018, from English into portuguese by Eleonora Meier for Satsang Editora (brazilian publisher) of the version of Swami Venkatesananda and it is available at www.lojasatsangeditora.com.br - - Páginas: 848 Swami Venkatesananda.\n\n\n\n[need citation]\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7702313", "categories": ["Hindu texts", "Vedanta", "Advaita", "Sanskrit texts"], "title": "Yoga Vasistha"}

In the course of the ensuing hand-to-hand fight, Allen and Murphy were killed. Lukes suffered a severe cut to the head but continued to fight; he survived the engagement. When reinforcements arrived, they found Lukes unconscious, with 18 bayonet wounds, lying over the body of Lieutenant McKee. Lukes remained unconscious aboard the \"Colorado\" for 39 days. For his actions on that occasion, Lukes was specially mentioned by his commanding officer for conspicuous \"coolness and bravery during the desperate fight\" and awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nBefore leaving the Navy, William Lukes obtained the rank of Seaman. Lukes suffered convulsions due to brain injury for the rest of his life. He died at the age of 76 and is buried in Los Angeles National Cemetery, Los Angeles, California.\n\nRank and organization: Landsman, U.S. Navy. Born: 1846, Bohemia. Enlisted at: Tientsin, China.

Struthers, 319 U.S. 141 (1943), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a law prohibiting the distribution of handbills from door to door violated the First Amendment rights of a Jehovah's Witness, specifically their freedom of speech. The ruling was 5-4 and deemed trespassing laws a better fit for the town imposing the ordinance.\n\nIn 1943, a woman from Struthers, Ohio by the name of Thelma Martin went knocking on doors to pass out Jehovah's Witness leaflets to people in her city. Martin's visits were not well received by some households which led to her arrest.\n\nShe was convicted \"in the Mayor's Court\" and fined for violating a Struthers, Ohio city ordinance which made it illegal to knock on doors to distribute handouts to that contained information about religious meetings. Martin confessed to handing out invitations to their religious meetings. The city ordinance was created to keep solicitors from coming to people's home and causing a disturbance.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the lower court. The Court held that the First Amendment protects both \"the right to distribute literature\" and \"the right to receive it\" and stated that the distribution of literature is protected \"even if it creates the minor nuisance for a community of cleaning litter from its streets.\" Justice Hugo Black, writing the opinion of the court, stated,\n\nWhile door to door distributers of literature may be either a nuisance or a blind for criminal activities, they may also be useful members of society engaged in the dissemination of ideas in accordance with the best tradition of free discussion. ...\n\nThe ordinance does not control anything but the distribution of literature, and in that respect, it substitutes the judgment of the community for the judgment of the individual householder. It submits the distributor to criminal punishment for annoying the person on whom he calls, even though the recipient of the literature distributed is, in fact, glad to receive it. ...\n\nIn any case the problem must be worked out by each community for itself with due respect for the constitutional rights of those desiring to distribute literature and those desiring to receive it, as well as those who choose to exclude such distributors from the home. ...\n\nWe conclude that the ordinance is invalid because [it is] in conflict with the freedom of speech and press.\n\nTherefore, Martin won her right to distribute information.\n\nJustices Reed, Roberts and Jackson dissented. Justice Reed wrote that\nThe most ... that can be or has been read into the ordinance is a prohibition of free distribution of printed matter by summoning inmates to their doors. There are excellent reasons to support a determination of the city council that such distributors may not disturb householders while permitting salesmen and others to call them to the door. Practical experience may well convince the council that irritations arise frequently from this method of advertising. The classification is certainly not discriminatory.\n\nTo prohibit such a call leaves open distribution of the notice on the street or at the home without signal to announce its deposit. Such assurance of privacy falls far short of an abridgment of freedom of the press.\n", "id": "7702416", "categories": ["United States Supreme Court cases", "American Civil Liberties Union litigation", "Jehovah's Witnesses litigation in the United States", "1943 in religion", "Mahoning County, Ohio", "United States Free Speech Clause case law", "United States Supreme Court cases of the Stone Court", "1943 in United States case law"], "title": "Martin v.

It is displayed in the permanent exhibition of the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec in Quebec City.\n\nThe picture includes many elements of what is known about the Patriote movement and their time. It features a number of Patriote leaders, upon the stage at the right, with accurate appearance. Patriote leader Louis-Joseph Papineau is shown in a speech to the crowd. At the bottom right stand three flags. From the left, the first represents the influence the Patriotes received from the French Revolution, the second is the Patriote flag and the third embodies the admiration of the Patriote for the American Revolution. The Patriote flag remains a visual leitmotiv across the composition.\n\nThe right field profusely displays maple leaves, a symbol of the French Canadians of the time (they have now been discarded by their modern-day Québécois and Quebec nationalist successors because of their appropriation by the Canadian federation). In the same section is the Coat of arms of Quebec, leaning upon the wooden stage structure (one anachronistic detail, as this version, contemporary to the painting's execution, is the first arms of Quebec post-Confederation, granted in 1868).\n\nThe crowd, mesmerized and invigorated at the same time by Papineau's much celebrated oratory skills, holds many signs reading nationalist and independence slogans. Many in attendance wear the tuques and ceintures fléchées belts characteristic of the Patriote symbology. The Colonne de la liberté stands tall in the background (the one from Henri Julien's and the contemporary replica appear much shorter). Finally, a very young girl at the immediate left-of-the-middle evocatively stares at the spectator.\n\nSmith was commissioned to paint it for display in the chamber of the Legislative Assembly in the Parliament of Quebec City. However, the government of Premier of Quebec Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville did not accept it, and the work was passed unto various owners before finally becoming part of the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec collection.\n\nLocated in Room 10, it is a part of the permanent exhibition of Quebec history-related art called \"Je me souviens : Quand l’art imagine l’histoire\" (\"Je me souviens [motto of Quebec]. When Art Imagines History\"). The picture has seen restoration. Nowadays, a great number of books related to the Patriotes, or their era in Quebec, use the painting, often cropped, to illustrate their cover page.\n\nIn a similar fashion, initial plans to erect a statue in honour of Louis-Joseph Papineau on the Quebec City Parliament Hill were aborted because of the then-controversial aspect of what was seen as a revolutionary figure. A smaller statue was instead made for interior display in the Parliament and a monument such as the one originally envisioned was inaugurated in the 2000s.\n\nThe Assembly of the Six Counties gathered Patriote leaders and approximately 4,000 followers in Saint-Charles, Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) on October 23 and October 24, 1837. Presided by Wolfred Nelson, it is the most famous of the various popular assemblies held during that year protesting the Russell Resolutions. It was a prelude to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 that sought the independence of a Lower Canadian republic. Speakers were united in their protest of the British colonial government, but, as one part supported economic boycotts of British products, the other appealed to an armed uprising.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7702449", "categories": ["Lower Canada Rebellion", "Patriote movement", "1890 paintings", "Canadian paintings", "Culture of Quebec", "Political art"], "title": "L'Assemblée des six-comtés (painting)"}

Kopper in command.\n\nAfter shakedown along the California coast, \"Missoula\" steamed from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor 6 to 12 December. She trained in Hawaiian waters during the next 6 weeks; thence, with units of the 5th Marine Division embarked, she sailed 27 January 1945, for the scheduled invasion of Iwo Jima. Among her troops she carried the men who on two separate occasions raised the American flag atop Mount Suribachi during bitter fighting 23 February. Assigned to Transport Squadron 16, she steamed via Eniwetok to the staging area at Saipan, where she completed final preparations for the invasion.\n\n\"Missoula\" sortied with Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill’s TF 53 on 16 February. She reached the transport area off Beach Green 1 before dawn 19 February, lowered her landing boats, and at 07:25 began debarking troops for the assault. As Marines stormed the beaches and began the struggle for Iwo Jima, \"Missoula\" sent ashore troops and cargo from her position about offshore. Late in the afternoon she departed the transport area for night cruising at sea; thence, she returned the following morning and resumed unloading operations. During the next 5 days she continued this pattern of operations.\n\nWhile operating in the transport area 23 February, she received the following message at 10:35: “American flag now flying on Mount Suribachi Yama.” Three Marines from Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, had raised the national colors from the summit of Mount Suribachi at 10:20. That flag, the first of two which flew from Mount Suribachi that day, the second flag was a larger replacement flag, had come from \"Missoula\". The 2nd Battalion adjutant, whose job it was to carry the flag, had brought the small set of colors from the attack transport during the invasion.\n\nIn addition, \"Missoula\" provided medical facilities for casualties of the fierce fighting ashore. Her four surgical teams treated 100 stretcher and ambulatory cases, 59 of whom were brought on board during the first day. After embarking a final group of casualties, she sailed in convoy for Saipan 25 February. The following morning one of the convoy escorts, , detected, depth-charged, and sank Japanese submarine \"I-370\". \"Missoula\" arrived Saipan 28 February; and, after debarking the wounded marines, she sailed for the New Hebrides with Transport Squadron 16 on 5 March.\n\nSteaming via Tulagi, \"Missoula\" reached Espiritu Santo 15 March and there embarked 1,177 Army troops of the 27th Division. She departed with other transports 25 March, touched at Ulithi 3 April, and arrived off the western beaches of Okinawa 9 April. During the next 5 days she discharged men and supplies and embarked 143 casualties of the Okinawa campaign; thence, between 14 and 18 April she steamed to Saipan.\n\nFor much of the next month \"Missoula\" operated out of Ulithi after which she headed for troop training exercises in the Philippines. She arrived Subic Bay, Luzon, 31 May, and during the closing weeks of the war against Japan, she took part in preparing Army troops for a possible amphibious invasion of Japan. Following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese ended hostilities 15 August; thence, Missoula supported the movement of occupation troops into Japan.\n\nAs part of TF 33, \"Missoula\" departed Subic Bay 27 August. She entered Tokyo Bay on the morning of 2 September and began debarking troops of the 1st Cavalry Division at 09:51. Less than an hour before in another part of the bay, the Japanese Foreign Minister, Mamoru Shigemitsu, had signed the Instrument of Surrender on board , thus officially ending World War II.\n\n\"Missoula\" returned to the Philippines 4 to 11 September, and embarked additional occupation troops at Zamboanga and Mindanao. Departing Leyte Gulf 22 September, she arrived Okinawa 25 September, and on 3 October, sailed for the Inland Sea. Between 6 and 11 October, she debarked troops for the occupation of the rubble that was once Hiroshima. \n\nShe returned to Okinawa 13 October and joined in the mighty task of returning veterans of the Pacific campaigns to the United States.\n\nWith 1,923 troops embarked, \"Missoula\" sailed 17 October, and arrived San Francisco 1 November. She departed on a second “Magic Carpet” run 21 November, and on 6 December, embarked 2,060 soldiers at Okinawa. She steamed to Tacoma, Washington, 8 to 21 December; thence, she returned to the western Pacific 21 January 1946, for further trooplift duty. She carried 692 men of the 2d Marine Air Wing from Okinawa to Yokosuka early in February, embarked more than 2,000 veterans at Okinawa and Guam later that month, and departed Guam for the west coast 22 February. \"Missoula\" reached San Francisco 5 March, discharged her passengers, and completed her “Magic Carpet” duty.\n\nAssigned to the 19th Fleet 9 April, \"Missoula\" operated in the San Francisco Bay area during the next 5 months.\n\nShe decommissioned at Port Chicago, California, 13 September 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Mare Island. Her name was struck from the Navy list 1 October 1958. She transferred to the Maritime Administration the same day and was assigned to the National Defense Reserve Fleet.

His credits included \"My Sister Eileen\", which he produced both on stage and on film.\n\nBorn Mechel Salpeter, Gordon was the youngest son of immigrants from Poland. His older brother, Cliff, used the stage name of \"Gordon,\" and Max then used it also. Cliff, an entertainer in vaudeville, died at age 32 (in 1913).\n\nThen in his early 20s, Gordon within months formed a vaudeville agency with Albert Lewis, his late brother's former vaudeville and burlesque partner. They specialized in providing sketches for shows, and their material, and performers (e.g. Phil Baker and Lou Holtz), played the Keith and Orpheum circuits. It was on May 24, 1921, the tail end of this period- months before the team produced their first play- that Gordon wed Mildred Bartlett, of Amsterdam, New York. Bartlett gave up her acting career- she performed in films under the name Raye Dean- a few months before the wedding at the request of her fiance.\n\nGordon soon became one of New York's most successful producers, from the Roaring Twenties and Depression-era on into the Eisenhower years. One of his first great hits came when he presented, with Lewis, the original stage incarnation of \"The Jazz Singer\", which ran from September 1925 to June 1926. The year following the stock market crash of 1929- \"Marx, the jig is up\" is how he famously relayed the news to his friend and frequent tip recipient- Gordon became an independent producer . By 1932, broke and suffering from a nervous collapse, such friends as \"George Kaufman offered him fifteen \nhundred of the sixteen hundred dollars Kaufman had at that time, and Harpo Marx came to see him in the hospital with his pockets stuffed with cash and strewed it over the bed...\"\nIt was in these years that Gordon gradually became playwright Kaufman's producer of choice - 10 shows in 25 years- starting in 1931 with the Astaires' final musical, The Bandwagon. Gordon had even greater luck with the married playwrights Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. For Kanin's Born Yesterday - it ran 1,642 performances- producer Gordon even had a hand in discovering its star, Judy Holliday (\"The minute she walked in, I knew she was it.\").\n\nHis reputation during this era was immortalized in Cole Porter's song \"Anything Goes\" from the musical of the same name:\n\n\"When Rockefeller still can hoard enough\"<br> \n\"money to let Max Gordon\"<br>\n\"produce his shows--\"<br>\n\"Anything goes!\"\n\n\n", "id": "7702481", "categories": ["American theatre managers and producers", "American film producers", "1892 births", "1978 deaths"], "title": "Max Gordon (producer)"}

It is a major pest in cotton and one of the most polyphagous and cosmopolitan pest species. It should not be confused with the similarly named, related species \"Helicoverpa zea\".\n\nThis species comprises two sub-species: \"Helicoverpa armigera armigera\" is widespread in central and southern Europe, temperate Asia and Africa; \"Helicoverpa armigera conferta\" is found in Australia, and Oceania. The former sub-species has also recently been confirmed to have successfully invaded Brazil and has since spread across much of South America and reached the Caribbean. It is a migrant species, able to reach Scandinavia and other northern territories.\n\nThe cotton bollworm is very variable in both size and colour. The body length varies between with a wingspan of . The fore wings are yellowish to orange in females and greenish-gray in males, with a slightly darker transversal band in the distal third. The external transversal and submarginal lines and the reniform spot are diffused. The hind wings are a pale yellow with a narrow brown band at the external edge and a dark round spot in the middle.\n\nThe female cotton bollworm can lay several hundred eggs, distributed on various parts of the plant. Under favourable conditions, the eggs can hatch into larvae within three days and the whole lifecycle can be completed in just over a month.\n\nThe eggs are spherical and 0.4 to 0.6 mm in diameter, and have a ribbed surface. They are white, later becoming greenish.\n\nThe larvae take 13 to 22 days to develop, reaching up to 40 mm long in the sixth instar. Their colouring is variable, but mostly greenish and yellow to red-brown. The head is yellow with several spots. Three dark stripes extend along the dorsal side and one yellow light stripe is situated under the spiracles on the lateral side. The ventral parts of the larvae are pale. They are rather aggressive, occasionally carnivorous and may even cannibalise each other. If disturbed, they fall from the plant and curl up on the ground.\n\nThe pupae develop inside a silken cocoon over 10 to 15 days in soil at a depth of , or in cotton bolls or maize ears.\n\nThe cotton bollworm is a highly polyphagous species. The most important crop hosts are tomato, cotton, pigeon pea, chickpea, rice, sorghum, and cowpea. Other hosts include groundnut, okra, peas, field beans, soybeans, lucerne, \"Phaseolus\" spp., other Leguminosae, tobacco, potatoes, maize, flax, \"Dianthus\", \"Rosa\", \"Pelargonium\", \"Chrysanthemum\", \"Lavandula angustifolia\", a number of fruit trees, forest trees, and a range of vegetable crops. In Russia and adjacent countries, the larvae populate more than 120 plant species, favouring \"Solanum\", \"Datura\", \"Hyoscyamus\", \"Atriplex\", and \"Amaranthus\" genera.\n\nThe greatest damage is caused to cotton, tomatoes, maize, chick peas, alfalfa, and tobacco. The economic threshold of harmfulness in central Asia is three to five larvae per hundred plants of long-staple cotton and eight to 12 larvae per hundred plants on medium-staple cotton. In cotton crops, blooms that have been attacked may open prematurely and stay fruitless. When the bolls are damaged, some will fall off and others will fail to produce lint or produce lint of an inferior quality. Secondary infections by fungi and bacteria are common and may lead to rotting of fruits. Injury to the growing tips of plants may disturb their development, maturity may be delayed, and the fruits may be dropped. Control measures include the use of NOCTOVI adulticide attract and kill formulation, growing of resistant varieties, weeding, inter-row cultivation, removing crop residues, deep autumn ploughing, winter watering to destroy the pupae, the use of insecticides or biological control through the release of entomophages such as \"Trichogramma\" spp. and \"Habrobracon hebetor\". Monitoring is possible by the use of sex pheromone traps. Development of Bt cotton (genetically modified to produce \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" toxin) improved yields of lint.\n\nGenome analysis\n\nThe genomes of \"Helicoverpa armigera conferta\" and \"Helicoverpa zea\" were published in July 2017.\n\n", "id": "7702498", "categories": ["Moths described in 1809", "Agricultural pest insects", "Helicoverpa", "Owlet moths of Africa", "Cosmopolitan moths"], "title": "Helicoverpa armigera"}

In a last-minute attempt to lift the sound of the album, Victor came up with \"The Grace\" during a late night writing session, only a month before the album went into stores. After capturing Dallas Green's vocal parts in Toronto, Ontario, the song was promptly mixed and released in Canada.\n\nEvery instrument and part in the song was performed and recorded by Daniel Victor in his home studio in Windsor, Ontario, Canada (except for the violin parts). Commenting on the song's name, Victor stated that \"...it's about someone's thoughts that dying could be a positive thing, a good transition to get away from the world...and the person in the song is trying to figure out where he really belongs in this world with the help of his angels...\"[quoted from an e-mail reply written to a fan]. Themes of life and death are the main focus of Victor's debut album, and this song is no exception. Its original title was \"The Grace of a Happy Death\".\n\nAs the first single from the album, it received extensive radio play across the country, eventually charting #3 on Rock Radio and #1 the Rock Audience Chart. It also reached #1 on many popular radio station countdowns including Edge 102 in Toronto (for 2 weeks).\n\nThe music video is a cinematic blue-tinged love story between a man (played by Victor) and a fallen angel (played by musician Emm Gryner) in the Victorian era. It hit #1 on MuchMusic in April 2006, and on MuchMoreMusic for two weeks that same month. \"The Grace\" essentially launched Neverending White Lights into the Canadian spotlight.\n\nThe video starts off with glimpses of statues of angels, and a camera clicking as they are filmed. It then leads to a scene of Victor mending the wings of a fallen angel in his home. As he sews the feathers in, a long and painful process, tears roll down the angel's cheeks. Victor wipes them off gently with a feather. Over the next few days as he finishes his work, plays music to her and shows her the film of the statues he'd taken earlier, it is evident he falls in love with her. Each day the angel puts on a white pendant with the figure of a woman on it, and Victor shows her a good time. But at last, Victor's work is done, and the grateful angel, with her new wings, touches his face gingerly before disappearing. She leaves the pendant behind. Heartbroken, Victor commits suicide, and the angel reappears then and stays by his side, grieving as the song ends with one final piano note.\n", "id": "7702502", "categories": [], "title": "The Grace (song)"}

The Sabbath School service for adults typically has two portions. The first portion begins with a song service, followed by a mission emphasis and a short talk. The second, and larger portion, is the lesson study. Different churches conduct Sabbath School in many ways, mostly teaching on the same topic or reading in a given week, as each quarter of the year has a different theme that reflects Bible, doctrinal, or church lifestyle teachings. The lesson booklet is called the \"quarterly.\" \n\nSabbath School may be conducted in one large class, or the congregation may separate into smaller groups for discussion in the sanctuary or in different rooms. Participation is not restricted to Church members. Young people often meet separately. After Sabbath School the church service begins, usually at 11:00am.\n\nOn the last Sabbath of the quarter, or the 13th Sabbath, a special collection is taken for a missionary project. During the \"13th Sabbath Program,\" youngsters may present a music or acting special based on the subject learned that quarter or explain the traditions and dress in the attire of the countries or world regions which offerings collected will benefit. Communion Service preceded by footwashing may take place on or right after the 13th Sabbath. \n\nA 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders estimated that 67% of Adventists, including 63% of under-18s, \"attend Sabbath School nearly every week\".\n\nSabbath School teachers are usually lay people selected by a designated coordinator, board, or committee. Normally, the selection is based on a perception of character and ability to teach the Bible rather than formal training in education, although some Sabbath School teachers have a background in education as a result of their occupation. Some churches offer courses in teaching, or hold teachers' classes to go over the lesson for that Sabbath; other churches allow volunteers who make a profession of faith to teach without training.\n\nAdult church members are provided with the \"Adult Bible Study Guide\" (formerly known as \"Sabbath School Quarterly\") issued four times a year. It is also known as the \"Quarterly\" and the \"Lesson\". It is published by Pacific Press Publishing Association. Sabbath School quarterlies are Bible study guides that cover a specific topic or book of the Bible every quarter. The quarterly is designed to be read during the week, so that during Sabbath School, the class members are ready to discuss questions and topics raised in that lesson in small groups. The Adult Sabbath School always has a heavy focus on the Bible. All Seventh-day Adventists around the world use the same Sabbath School quarterly, translated into the necessary languages (with few exceptions such as Germany, where members cover the same topic with different material). the editor of the Adult Sabbath School lessons was Clifford Goldstein.\n\nAt the same time as the adult study, children attend classes for their age group. Typical age group divisions are Beginner (infants), Kindergarten (K), Primary (Grades 1-3), Junior (Grades 4-6), Earliteen (Grades 7-8), Youth (High School), and Collegiate (College and Young Adult). Each age division has its own specific quarterly, which is titled by the class name up to Primary. Juniors and Earliteens often share the same quarterly entitled \"PowerPoints\". Some Earliteen groups use a separate publication entitled \"Real Time Faith\". Youth use either \"Cornerstone Connections\" or \"Collegiate Quarterly (CQ)\". Some churches give the children a weekly magazine at the close of Sabbath School. Kindergarten receives \"Our Little Friend\", Primary receives \"Primary Treasure\", Juniors and Earliteens receive \"Guide\", and the Youth receive \"Insight\".\n\n\n", "id": "7702522", "categories": ["History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church"], "title": "Sabbath School"}

Developed at the CBS Technology Center, FMX was intended to improve this characteristic for listeners in the fringe areas where the noise penalty would be worst. This improvement was achieved by adding an amplitude-compressed version of the L−R (left-minus-right, or difference) signal modulated in quadrature with the stereo subcarrier, using a version of the CX noise-reduction system originally developed at CBS for LP records.\n\nUpon his accession as Chairman of CBS, Laurence Tisch closed the CBS labs in 1986, whereupon the FMX intellectual property was spun off to an investment group, under the name Broadcast Technology Partners (BTP).\n\nWith about 50 stations using the technology and perhaps another 50 committed, a controversy emerged in 1989 when MIT professor and Bose Corporation CEO Amar Bose and Bose engineer William Short released a critical study, finding the system to have the potential to \"seriously degrade the quality of stereo reception whether received by FMX equipment or not.\" According to the study, the heavy compression of the L−R audio caused interference in receivers under multipath conditions. A BTP spokesman rebutted the finding, saying that the Bose analysis exaggerated a \"worst-case scenario\", and actually employed \"flawed mathematics\" to attempt to prove their point. Perhaps not coincidentally, a patent application filed earlier by Bose disclosed an invention whose implementation was incompatible with the adoption of FMX, while another – filed by Bose and Short around the time of the release of the critical study – sought to improve the performance of FMX under multipath conditions.\n\nDespite industrial supporters in both the broadcast and consumer electronics industries, the system never achieved a critical mass, and faded into obscurity. However, numerous related patents have since been applied for or granted, referencing the original FMX patents.\n\n\n", "id": "7702556", "categories": ["Consumer electronics", "Broadcasting"], "title": "FMX (broadcasting)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702566", "text": "Supercritical fluid chromatography\n\nSupercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) is a form of normal phase chromatography that uses a supercritical fluid such as carbon dioxide as the mobile phase. It is used for the analysis and purification of low to moderate molecular weight, thermally labile molecules and can also be used for the separation of chiral compounds. Principles are similar to those of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), however SFC typically utilizes carbon dioxide as the mobile phase; therefore the entire chromatographic flow path must be pressurized. Because the supercritical phase represents a state in which liquid and gas properties converge, supercritical fluid chromatography is sometimes called convergence chromatography.\n\nSFC is used in industry primarily for separation of chiral molecules, and uses the same columns as standard HPLC systems. SFC is now commonly used for achiral separations and purifications in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nSFC with CO utilizes carbon dioxide pumps that require that the incoming CO and pump heads be kept cold in order to maintain the carbon dioxide at a temperature and pressure that keeps it in a liquid state where it can be effectively metered at some specified flow rate. The CO subsequently becomes supercritical post the injector and in the column oven when the temperature and pressure it is subjected to are raised above the critical point of the liquid and the supercritical state is achieved. SFC as a chromatographic process has been likened to a process having the combined properties of the power of a liquid to dissolve a matrix, with the chromatographic interactions and kinetics of a gas. The result is that you can get a lot of mass on column per injection, and still maintain a high chromatographic efficiency. Typically, gradient elution is employed in analytical SFC using a polar co-solvent such as methanol, possibly with a weak acid or base at low concentrations ~1%. The effective plate counts per analysis can be observed to exceed 500K plates per metre routinely with 5 um material. The operator uses software to set mobile phase flow rate, co-solvent composition, system back pressure and column oven temperature which must exceed 40 °C for supercritical conditions to be achieved with CO. In addition, SFC provides an additional control parameter - pressure - by using an automated back pressure regulator. From an operational standpoint, SFC is as simple and robust as HPLC but fraction collection is more convenient because the primary mobile phase evaporates leaving only the analyte and a small volume of polar co-solvent. If the outlet CO is captured, it can be recompressed and recycled, allowing for >90% reuse of CO.\n\nSimilar to HPLC, SFC uses a variety of detection methods including UV/VIS, mass spectrometry, FID (unlike HPLC) and evaporative light scattering.\n\nA rule-of-thumb is that any molecule that will dissolve in methanol or a less polar solvent is compatible with SFC, including polar solutes. CO has polarity similar to n-heptane at its critical point, but the solvent strength can be increased by increasing density or using a polar cosolvent. In practice, when the fraction of cosolvent is high, the mobile phase is not truly supercritical, but this terminology is used regardless.\n\nThe mobile phase is composed primarily of supercritical carbon dioxide, but since CO on its own is too non-polar to effectively elute many analytes, cosolvents are added to modify the mobile phase polarity. Cosolvents are typically simple alcohols like methanol, ethanol, or isopropyl alcohol. Other solvents such as acetonitrile, chloroform, or ethyl acetate can be used as modifiers. For food-grade materials, the selected cosolvent is often ethanol or ethyl acetate, both of which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). The solvent limitations are system and column based.\n\nThere have been a few technical issues that have limited adoption of SFC technology, first of which is the high pressure operating conditions. High-pressure vessels are expensive and bulky, and special materials are often needed to avoid dissolving gaskets and O-rings in the supercritical fluid. A second drawback is difficulty in maintaining pressure (backpressure regulation). Whereas liquids are nearly incompressible, so their densities are constant regardless of pressure, supercritical fluids are highly compressible and their physical properties change with pressure - such as the pressure drop across a packed-bed column. Currently, automated backpressure regulators can maintain a constant pressure in the column even if flow rate varies, mitigating this problem. A third drawback is difficulty in gas/liquid separation during collection of product. Upon depressurization, the CO rapidly turns into gas and aerosolizes any dissolved analyte in the process. Cyclone separators have lessened difficulties in gas/liquid separations.\n", "id": "7702566", "categories": [], "title": "Supercritical fluid chromatography"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702597", "text": "Emerin\n\nEmerin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the \"EMD\" gene, also known as the \"STA\" gene. Emerin, together with LEMD3, is a LEM domain-containing integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane in vertebrates. Emerin is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiac muscle, emerin localizes to adherens junctions within intercalated discs where it appears to function in mechanotransduction of cellular strain and in beta-catenin signaling. Mutations in emerin cause X-linked recessive Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, cardiac conduction abnormalities and dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nIt is named after Alan Emery.\n\nEmerin is a 29.0 kDa (34 kDa observed MW) protein composed of 254 amino acids. Emerin is a serine-rich protein with an N-terminal 20-amino acid hydrophobic region that is flanked by charged residues; the hydrophobic region may be important for anchoring the protein to the membrane, with the charged terminal tails being cytosolic. In cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle, emerin localizes to the inner nuclear membrane; expression of emerin is highest in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In cardiac muscle specifically, emerin also resides at adherens junctions within intercalated discs.\n\nEmerin is a serine-rich nuclear membrane protein and a member of the nuclear lamina-associated protein family. It mediates membrane anchorage to the cytoskeleton. Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is an X-linked inherited degenerative myopathy resulting from mutation in the \"EMD\" (also known clinically as \"STA\") gene. Emerin appears to be involved in mechanotransduction, as emerin-deficient mouse fibroblasts failed to transduce normal mechanosensitive gene expression responses to strain stimuli. In cardiac muscle, emerin is also found complexed to beta-catenin at adherens junctions of intercalated discs, and cardiomyocytes from hearts lacking emerin showed beta-catenin redistribution as well as perturbed intercalated disc architecture and myocyte shape. This interaction appears to be regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta.\n\nMutations in emerin cause X-linked recessive Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, which is characterized by early contractures in the Achilles tendons, elbows and post-cervical muscles; muscle weakness proximal in the upper limbs and distal in lower limbs; along with cardiac conduction defects that range from sinus bradycardia, PR prolongation to complete heart block. In these patients, immunostaining of emerin is lost in various tissues, including muscle, skin fibroblasts, and leukocytes, however diagnostic protocols involve mutational analysis rather than protein staining. In nearly all cases, mutations result in a complete deletion, or undetectable levels, of emerin protein. Approximately 20% of cases have X chromosomes with an inversion within the Xq28 region.\n\nMoreover, recent research have found that the absence of functional emerin may decrease the infectivity of HIV-1. Thus, it is speculated that patients suffering from Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy may have immunity to or show an irregular infection pattern to HIV-1.\n\nEmerin has been shown to interact with:\n\n\n", "id": "7702597", "categories": [], "title": "Emerin"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702640", "text": "Cephalophore\n\nA cephalophore (from the Greek for \"head-carrier\") is a saint who is generally depicted carrying their own head. In Christian art, this was usually meant to signify that the subject in question had been martyred by beheading. Handling the halo in this circumstance offers a unique challenge for the artist; some put the halo where the head used to be, others have the saint carrying the halo along with the head, and some split the difference.\nAssociated legends often tell of the saint standing and carrying his own head after the beheading.\n\nThe term \"cephalophore\" was first used in a French article by Marcel Hébert, \"Les martyrs céphalophores Euchaire, Elophe et Libaire\", in \"Revue de l'Université de Bruxelles\", v. 19 (1914).\n\nThe \"topos\" can be traced to two sources. In a homily on Saints Juventinus and Maximinus, John Chrysostom asserted that the severed head of a martyr was more terrifying to the devil than when it was able to speak. \"He then compared soldiers showing their wounds received in battle to martyrs holding their severed head in their hands and presenting it to Christ\". The other source was the Western \"vita\" of Saint Denis, founder of the see of Paris, who was identified in the text with Dionysius the Areopagite.\nJohn the Baptist, the best known beheaded saint, is not considered a cephalophore, since he did not hold his own head in his hands.\nThus, an original, and perhaps the most famous cephalophore is Denis, patron saint of Paris, who, according to the Golden Legend, miraculously preached with his head in his hands while journeying the seven miles from Montmartre to his burying place. Although St Denis is the best known of the saintly head-carriers, there were many others; the folklorist Émile Nourry counted no less than 134 examples of cephalophory in French hagiographic literature alone. Given the frequency with which relics were stolen in medieval Europe, stories like this, in which a saint clearly indicates their chosen burial site, may have developed as a way of discouraging such acts of \"furta sacra\".\n\nA cephalophoric legend of Nicasius of Rheims tells that at the moment of his execution, Nicasius was reading Psalm 119 (Psalm 118 in the Vulgate). When he reached the verse \"Adhaesit pavimento anima mea\" (\"My soul is attached unto dust\") (verse 25), he was decapitated. After his head had fallen to the ground, Nicasius continued the psalm, adding, \"Vivifica me, Domine, secundum verbum tuum.\" (\"Revive me, Lord, with your words\") The theme of the speaking head is extended in the 8th-century \"Passio\" of Saint Justus of Beauvais: after the child had been beheaded by Roman soldiers, his father and brother found the corpse sitting with his head in his lap. Giving the head to his father, Justus asked him to carry it to Auxerre, that his mother, Felicia, might kiss it. \n\nThe legend of Aphrodisius of Alexandria was transferred to Béziers, where his name was inserted at the head of the list of bishops. In the hagiographic accounts, Aphrodisius was accompanied by his camel. As he was preaching, a group of pagans pressed through the crowd and beheaded him on the spot. Aphrodisius picked up his head and carried it to the chapel which he had recently consecrated at the site. It is identified today as \"Place Saint-Aphrodise, Béziers\". \nSaint Gemolo is said to have survived his decapitation and, after collecting his head, climbed on horseback. He rode to meet his uncle, a bishop, on a small mountain before he finally died.\nA legend associated with Saint Ginés de la Jara states that after he was decapitated in southern France, he picked up his head and threw it into the Rhône. The head was carried by the sea to the coast of Cartagena in Spain, where it was venerated as a relic (Cartagena was the center of this saint's cult).\n\nIn \"The Golden Legend\", Paul the Apostle at his martyrdom \"stretched forth his neck, and so was beheaded. And as soon as the head was from the body, it said: Jesus Christus! which had been to Jesus or Christus, or both, fifty times.\" When the head was recovered and was to be rejoined to the body as a relic, in response to a prayer for confirmation that this was indeed the right head, the body of Paul turned to rejoin the head that had been set at its feet.\n\nIn legend, the female saint Osyth stood up after her execution, picking up her head like Saint Denis in Paris and other cephalophoric martyrs, and walking with it in her hands, to the door of a local convent, before collapsing there. Similarly, Valerie of Limoges carried her severed head away to her confessor, Saint Martial.\n\nSaint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne is often depicted with his head on his neck/shoulders and carrying a second head in his hands. However, he is not a cephalophore. The second head is that of Saint Oswald of Northumbria, who was buried with him at Durham Cathedral.\n\nIn Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" (Canto 28) the poet meets the spectre of the troubadour Bertrand de Born in the eighth circle of the Inferno, carrying his severed head in his hand, slung by its hair, like a lantern; upon seeing Dante and Virgil, the head begins to speak.\n\nThe speaking severed head appears memorably in \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\".\n\nThe motif \"Head\" in Stith Thompson's \"Motif-Index of Folk Literature\" reveals how universal is the anomaly of the talking severed head. Aristotle is at pains to discredit the stories of talking heads and to establish the physical impossibility, with the windpipe severed from the lung. \"Moreover,\" he adds, \"among the barbarians, where heads are chopped off with great rapidity, nothing of the kind has ever occurred.\" Aristotle was doubtless familiar with the story of the singing disembodied head of Orpheus and Homer's image of heads severed so rapidly they seemed still to be speaking, and Latin examples could be attested. A link between Latin poets and the Middle Ages in transmitting the \"trope\" of the speaking head was noted by Beatrice White, in the Latin poem on the Trojan War, \"De Bello Troiano\" by Joseph of Exeter. Hector whirls in the air the severed head of Patroclus, which whispers \"\"Ultor ubi Aeacides\"\", \"Where is Achilles [Aeacides], my avenger?\"\nSome modern authors link the legends of cephalophores miraculously walking with their heads in their hands to the Celtic cult of heads.\n\nBaba Deep Singh [Sikh Faith]\n\n", "id": "7702640", "categories": ["Cephalophores", "Types of saints"], "title": "Cephalophore"}

Zircon-rich sediments are mined and the recovered zircon is used to produce zirconium metal and zirconium dioxide. These are used in a wide variety of manufactured products and industrial processes.\nZircon is mainly consumed as an opacifier, and has been known to be used in the decorative ceramics industry.\n\nRutile is a titanium oxide mineral that is most commonly found in granites, pegmatites, and metamorphic rocks. It is also found in sands derived from the weathering of these rocks. Rutile also forms as slender crystals within quartz and micas. It is a common mineral in the alluvial sands that are dredged for magnetite and ilmenite.\nRutile is used as a coating on welding rods. It is also used as an ore of titanium, a metal used where light weight and high strength are needed. Some rutile is used in the production of pigments for paints.\n\nMonazite is a rare phosphate mineral with a chemical composition of (Ce,La,Nd,Th)(PO4,SiO4). It usually occurs in small isolated grains, as an accessory mineral in igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, pegmatite, schist, and gneiss. These grains are resistant to weathering and become concentrated in soils and sediments downslope from the host rock. When in high enough concentrations, they are mined for their rare earth and thorium content.\nMonazite is an important source of thorium, cerium, and other rare elements. Often mined as a byproduct from heavy mineral deposits.\nKenmare does not yet produce Monazite, however, the company announced its intention to begin production in the future.\n\nKenmare’s products are raw materials for the production of many consumer products. The market for ilmenite, zircon and rutile is a substantial one and is heavily linked to the performance of the global economy. Kenmare’s sales profile is geographically diverse with 18% sold into the United States, 25% into Europe and 57% into Asia, principally China .\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a bottleneck in global supply and a very favourable market, the decision was taken in 2011 to undertake a major expansion of the mine. The goal of the expansion was to raise production to 1m tonnes.\nAs the project was being developed, the market cycle turned. By 2016 the mine had fallen into financial crisis due to a worldwide drop in mineral prices, flooding in northern Mozambique, and power outages in the Moma District region.[6] Prices for titanium fell by about a third between 2012 and 2015,[7] and floods that caused power outages impacted the company's production.[8] \n\nThe mine briefly suspended operations in June 2015 in the face of industrial action by employees unhappy about the company's cost-cutting measures. Successful negotiation between the union, the company and the Ministry of Labour had resulted in agreement on somewhat less drastic measures involving fewer layoffs than originally announced. The industrial action was not organized by the union. Operations resumed in early July.\n\nBy 2016 the mine had fallen into financial crisis due to a worldwide drop in mineral prices, flooding in northern Mozambique, and power outages in the Moma District region. Prices for titanium fell by about a third between 2012 and 2015, and floods that caused power outages impacted the company's production. \n\nIn June 2014, following media speculation in Australia, both Iluka and Kenmare Resources announced that the former Company had many an approach to Kenmare, based on a paper transaction, regarding a possible takeover. No formal offer was made, although a number of prices were put forward.\nThe process carried on over an extended period, during which Iluka returned with a lower offer . The Iluka approaches failed to attract support from Kenmare’s largest shareholder and Iluka ultimately ended the process in December 2015.\n\nAs Iluka were announcing their decision to withdraw from takeover talks, Kenmare management announced that the Oman Sovereign Wealth Fund had indicated an interest in investing $100m, based on an overall restructuring arrangement being accepted by shareholders. The deal which would ultimately be agreed, saw the Omani’s invest $100m of an overall $275 refinancing of the company. Lenders to the Company agreed to substantially reduce debt. Existing shareholders also experienced a write down as new shares were issued. The overall impact of the restructuring was to leave the company with a substantially strengthened Balance Sheet, placing the Company on a firm financial footing. \n\nSince the completion of the Mine expansion, production and shipments have risen to record levels. Production in 2017 was just short of 1m tonnes. Kenmare reported a return to profit in 2017. Full year profits after tax of $19.4m were reported by the Company. On October 16th 2018, Kenmare announced their first dividend policy. They indicated dividend payments would commence in 2019.\n\nIn their interim results in August 2018, Kenmare announced a number of projects which had either been approved or were under active consideration. The goal of these projects is to increase long term production to 1.2m tonnes of ilmenite and associated products. These include the upgrade of an existing Wet Concentrator Plant, development of a new Wet Concentrator Plant and a project to recover Monazite from existing operations.\n\n", "id": "7702665", "categories": ["Companies of Mozambique", "Companies of the Republic of Ireland", "Titanium"], "title": "Kenmare Resources"}

It is the national bird of Myanmar.\n\nIt is a large pheasant, up to 76 cm long and greyish brown with finely spotted green eyespots, an elongated bushy crest, bare pink or yellow facial skin, white throat, and grey iris, bill and legs. The sexes are rather similar, but the female is smaller, darker and less ornamented than the male. The young resemble the female.\n\nThe grey peacock-pheasant is distributed in lowland and hill forests of Bangladesh, Northeast India and Southeast Asia, but excluding most of Indochina as well as the entire Malayan Peninsula. The diet consists mainly of seeds, termites, fruits and invertebrates. The female usually lays two eggs.\n\nWidespread throughout its large range, the grey peacock-pheasant is evaluated as a Species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on CITES Appendix II, restricting trade in wild-caught birds to preserve its stocks.\n\nThree subspecies are recognized today as good, while an additional one is of unclear validity:\n\nOne previous subspecies, the Hainan peacock-pheasant (\"P. b. katsumatae\"), has since been given approved species (AS) status by the IOC.\n\nLowe's grey peacock-pheasant was described from a captive bird of unknown provenance. Similar examples have turned up on occasion, but the validity and – if distinct – home range of this taxon remains unknown. It was theorized to inhabit western Assam or the eastern Himalayas, but this is based on conjecture.\n\nThe phylogeny of this species is fairly enigmatic. mtDNA cytochrome \"b\" and D-loop as well as the nuclear ovomucoid intron G sequence data confirms that it belongs to a largely Continental Asian clade together with Germain's peacock-pheasant (\"P. germaini\"), but also the \"brown\" southern species bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant (\"P. chalcurum\") and mountain peacock-pheasant (\"P. inopinatum\").\n\nThe ovomucin sequence seems to have evolved convergently or with a decreased mutational rate on the grey and the bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant. Though they are quite similar on the molecular level, the distance and interspersed populations of their closest relatives argue against a much more recently shared common ancestry between them versus the other two \"northern\" peacock-pheasants. Also, the cytochrome \"b\" and D-loop data does not support a closer relationship between \"P. bicalcaratus\" and \"P. chalcurum\"; overall, as it seems the four species' ancestors separated during a very short timespan.\n\nNote however that in the absence of dedicated phylogeographic studies, the molecular data is only of limited value in this species, the most morphologically diverse and widespread peacock-pheasant: There is no data on the origin and number of specimens, but it is unlikely that more than one or two individuals – possibly of captive origin and undeterminable subspecific allocation – were sampled. All that can be reasonably assumed is that the grey peacock-pheasant evolved on mainland Southeast Asia, probably during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene 3.6-1 million years ago.\n\n\n", "id": "7702706", "categories": ["Birds of Yunnan", "Birds of Bhutan", "Birds of Cambodia", "Birds of Laos", "Birds of Myanmar", "Polyplectron", "Birds of Northeast India", "Birds of Vietnam", "Birds of Thailand", "Birds of Bangladesh"], "title": "Grey peacock-pheasant"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702746", "text": "Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd\n\nOverseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd, commonly known as Wagon Mound (No. 1), is a landmark tort law case, which imposed a remoteness rule for causation in negligence. The Privy Council held that a party can be held liable only for loss that was reasonably foreseeable. Contributory negligence on the part of the dock owners was also relevant in the decision, and was essential to the outcome, although not central to this case's legal significance.\n\n\"The Wagon Mound (No 1)\" should not be confused with the successor case of the \"Overseas Tankship v Miller Steamship\" or \"Wagon Mound (No 2)\", which concerned the standard of the reasonable man in breach of the duty of care.\n\nOverseas Tankship had a ship, the \"Wagon Mound\", docked in Sydney Harbour in October 1951. The crew had carelessly allowed furnace oil (also referred to as Bunker oil) to leak from their ship. The oil drifted under a wharf thickly coating the water and the shore where other ships were being repaired. Hot metal produced by welders using oxyacetylene torches on the respondent's timber wharf (Mort's Dock) at Sheerlegs Wharf fell on floating cotton waste which ignited the oil on the water. The wharf and ships moored there sustained substantial fire damage. In an action by Mort's Dock for damages for negligence it was found as a fact that the defendants did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the oil was capable of being set alight when spread on water. The dock owners knew the oil was there, and continued to use welders.\n\nThe leading case on proximate cause was \"Re Polemis\", which held that a defendant can be deemed liable for all consequences flowing from his negligent conduct regardless of how unforeseeable such consequences are. As this case was binding in Australia, its rule was followed by the New South Wales Court of Appeal. The defendant appealed to the Privy Council.\n\nThe Privy Council found in favour of the defendant, agreeing with the expert witness who provided evidence that the defendant, in spite of the furnace oil being innately flammable, could not reasonably expect it to burn on water. The Board indicated Morts would probably have been successful if they had claimed damages for direct damage by the oil to the slipway but this was minor and not part of the damages claimed (although success on this count may have saved Morts Dock and Engineering the costs of all the litigation for both parties across all three levels of court). Viscount Simonds, in his delivery for the Privy Council, said that the Counsel for Morts had discredited their own position by arguing that it couldn't have been bunkering oil because it wouldn't burn on water. The Privy Council's advice soundly disapproved the rule established in \"Re Polemis\", as being \"out of the current of contemporary thought\" and held that to find a party liable for negligence the damage must be reasonably foreseeable. The council found that even though the crew were careless and breached their duty of care, the resulting extensive damage by fire was not foreseeable by a reasonable person, although the minor damage of oil on metal on the slipway would have been foreseeable.\n\nViscount Simonds delivered the judgment of the Board and said:\n\nIt is, no doubt, proper when considering tortious liability for negligence to analyse its elements and to say that the plaintiff must prove a duty owed to him by the defendant, a breach of that duty by the defendant, and consequent damage. But there can be no liability until the damage has been done. It is not the act but the consequences on which tortious liability is founded. ... Who knows or can be assumed to know all the processes of nature? But if it would be wrong that a man should be held liable for damage unpredictable by a reasonable man because it was \"direct\" or \"natural,\" equally it would be wrong that he should escape liability, however \"indirect\" the damage, if he foresaw or could reasonably foresee the intervening events which led to its being done.\n\nIt is a principle of civil liability, subject only to qualifications which have no present relevance, that a man must be considered to be responsible for the probable consequences of his act. To demand more of him is too harsh a rule, to demand less is to ignore that civilised order requires the observance of a minimum standard of behaviour.\n\nUp until this time the leading case had been \"Re Polemis\", where the central question was that of the directness of the chain of events between the triggering act being examined for negligence and the result. The Council decided that rather than go with precedent (authority) they would determine a principle from a range of cases, in a similar way as Lord Atkin did in \"Donoghue v Stevenson\", and their principle was primarily a single test for \"foreseeability\" which they argued was a logical link between the damage and the liability (culpability). Stated differently, \"foreseeability\" was the logical link between, and the test for, breach of the duty of care and the damages. This is the supreme test, and may be rephrased as \"the liability of a consequence ... was natural or necessary or probable.\" The Lords made reference to hindsight, indicating it is nothing like foresight and should play no role in assessing negligence. There is authority to challenge this view of hindsight; in \"Page v Smith\", Lord Lloyd stated: \"In the case of secondary victims, i.e. persons who were not participants in an accident, the defendant will not be liable unless psychiatric injury is foreseeable in a person of normal fortitude and it may be legitimate to use hindsight in order to be able to apply the test of reasonable foreseeability.\"\n\nThe Lords gave Morts the opportunity to sue in nuisance but there is no record of them testing this action in that tort. The common law rules of causation have had their importance lessened by the promulgation of statute law in Australia. Contributory negligence is now essential for many determinations and are covered by statutes such as the Civil Liability Act (1936) South Australia which has more recent counterparts in a number of jurisdictions including New South Wales.\n\n", "id": "7702746", "categories": ["English causation case law", "1961 in Australian law", "Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases on appeal from Australia", "English tort case law"], "title": "Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd"}

CCAF serves approximately 300,000 active, guard, and reserve enlisted personnel, making CCAF the world's largest community college system. The college awards over 22,000 associate in applied science degrees from 71 degree programs annually.\n\nThe CCAF is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools through Air University.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Air Force decided to attempt to gain accreditation and recognition for Air Force training programs. Representatives of the Air Training Command (ATC), Air University, and the United States Air Force Academy held numerous conferences in 1971 to discuss increased training for Air Force non-commissioned officers (NCOs). These conferences, in turn, recommended the foundation of an Air Force community college. On 9 November 1971, Gen John D. Ryan, Air Force Chief of Staff, approved the establishment of the Community College of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force approved the plan 25 January 1972, and the college was officially established on 1 April 1972, at Randolph AFB, TX.\n\nUntil the mid-1970s, the CCAF offered only certificate programs. It became apparent that CCAF standards exceeded the minimum requirements of associate degree programs in civilian community colleges. Therefore, in 1975 the Air Force sought degree-granting authority for the college from Congress. President Gerald R. Ford signed Public Law 94-361 on 14 July 1976 authorizing the AETC commander to confer the associate degree.\n\nFollowing an evaluation in October 1976, the U.S. Commissioner of Education certified degree-granting authority in January 1977. The college awarded its first AAS degree in April 1977.\n\nWhen the Commission on Occupational Education Institution charter was limited in 1975 to non-degree-granting institutions, the CCAF began seeking accreditation from the SACS Commission on Colleges. The Commission on Colleges accredited the CCAF on 12 December 1980. In 2004, Air University became accredited by the SACS Commission on Colleges to award associate and master's degrees. CCAF now shares in Air University's regional accreditation. CCAF was separately accredited by SACS from 1980 to 2004.\n\nCurrently the CCAF is only open to airmen, but Congressman Sestak added language to the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act to open admission to all branches.\n\nThe program combines the technical education offered by Air Force schools with a core of general education from regionally accredited civilian institutions, and management education from Air Force or civilian sources.\n\nThe CCAF offers Associates of Applied Science degrees in five broad career areas:\n\n\nWithin those 5 broad areas, the CCAF currently offers 67 specific degree programs.\n\nIn June 2007 Air University announced a new program where four-year colleges accept the entire value (60 credits) of the CCAF Associate degree towards a bachelor's degree, requiring only 60 more credits (typically upper division, core classes). This program is called the Air University Associate-To-Baccalaureate Cooperative. It has been publicized as a convenient way for an Airman to complete their 4-year degree. It has also served to boost the desirability of a CCAF degree, as there is a notion among the enlisted members that a CCAF Associate degree only holds value in the Air Force community. As of October 2009 the AU-ABC program included 42 civilian colleges and universities offering 209 bachelor's degree programs. Thirty-six of the ABC schools hold regional accreditation, and six hold national accreditation through the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (formerly the Distance Education and Training Council).

During World War II, Bob flew approximately 700 combat missions, and claimed 60 victories; 37 of which were on the Eastern Front.\n\nBob joined the Luftwaffe in 1936, at the rank of a \"Fahnenjunker\" (officer candidate), and began his flight training on 1 June 1937.\n\nIn 1939, prior to the Invasion of Poland, Bob was transferred to the newly formed 3./\"Jagdgeschwader\" 21 (JG 21) (later known as the \"Devils Squadron\"), which was redesignated on 6 June 1940 into 9./\"Jagdgeschwader\" 54 (JG 54). It was equipped with the Bf 109 fighter, an aircraft Bob would become very familiar with over the years – flying every model except the \"Kurfürst\".\n\nDuring the French campaign on 10 May 1940, Bob claimed his first victory when he shot down a Gloster Gladiator over Tongeren in Belgium. That August, he was promoted to the rank of \"Oberleutnant\". On 10 October 1940, he was appointed \"Staffelkapitän\" of 7./JG 54 for a short period; he was soon appointed \"Staffelkapitän\" of 9./JG 54.\n\nDuring the Battle of Britain, 9./JG 54 was activated as a Jabo unit, targeting shipping vessels. By November 1940, Bob had recorded 19 kills, and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (\"Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes\") by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring on 7 March 1941.\n\nOn 21 March 1941, Bob survived, unhurt, a ditching into Cherbourg harbour with his Bü 131 training aircraft, which had suffered engine failure. After the Battle of Britain, he participated in the Balkan campaign, where he recorded his 20th and 21st victories. JG 54 was re-equipped with the new Bf 109 F and relocated to airfields in Prussia, in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Russia.\n\nOn 23 June 1941, Hans Ekkehard Bob recorded his first victory in Russian airspace – a Tupolev SB twin-engined bomber. During this combat, his Bf 109 F-2 was hit by return fire, resulting in a forced landing behind enemy lines. He evaded capture and returned to his unit two days later. Between 13 July and 30 October 1941, Bob made three more emergency landings due to aircraft combat damage behind enemy lines, but in each case returned to his unit.\n\nOn 29 September 1942, Bob had his 50th victory, and was promoted to \"Hauptmann\" later that year. Flying on the Eastern Front ended for Hans Ekkehard Bob and III./JG 54 in February 1943, after he received orders from \"General der Jagdflieger\" Adolf Galland to change positions with elements of the then French-based JG 26. This order was later cancelled, but III. Gruppe stayed on the Western Front, separated from the rest of the 'Greenhearts', serving initially in northern Germany with \"Jagdgeschwader\" 1.\n\nOn 17 April 1943, Bob recorded his 57th victory; the ramming of a USAAF Boeing B-17 bomber near Bremen with his Bf 109 G-6. He bailed out and survived the crash without injury. On 1 August, Bob was promoted to the rank of \"Major\" and was appointed \"Gruppenkommandeur\" of IV./JG 54. He returned to the Eastern Front, where he scored a further two victories.\n\nBy May 1944, Bob was back at the Western Front as \"Gruppenkommandeur\" of II./\"Jagdgeschwader\" 3 (JG 3), based in the Normandy invasion front corridor, flying \"Reichsverteidigung\" (Defense of the Reich) duties. In August, he was transferred to \"Erprobungskommando 262\" where he learned to fly the Messerschmitt Me 262.\n\nIn early 1945, his experience led to his becoming a member of \"General der Flieger\" Josef Kammhuber's staff. Bob was responsible for allocating newly built Me 262's to operational units. Later, he took command of I. and II./EJG 2 and was responsible for practice and training former bomber pilots in flying the Me 262.\n\nBob was one of the aces chosen to fly as a member of the jet fighter unit JV 44, led by Adolf Galland. In the final days of World War II, Bob was responsible for building a longer runway at Innsbruck airfield for the Me 262 jets. At the capitulation on 8 May 1945, Bob was in Kappl, a small village near Salzburg. From Kappl, he walked more than in six weeks to return to his home in Celle.\n\nBob returned to civilian life working as a farm labourer. In 1946, he founded his own transport company.\n\nAround this time, he met Waldemar Wübke, an old JV 44 comrade, and a friend from his time in JG 54. Bob always told Wübke's history with a smile on his face. Wübke still wore his old uniform and officer cap as he was questioned by a British officer. \"Why are you wearing this old stuff?\" Wübke replied, \"Do I ask you if your grandma has hemorrhoids?\" He never met Wübke again, and Wübke later died in the early 1950s in Argentina, the result of injuries sustained in an airliner crash.\n\nIn 1956, Bob established the Celle Flying Club.\n\nFrom 30 September to 1 October 2000, Bob also was among the historical figures at the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Santa Monica, California.\n\nBob had been married to his wife Christa for over 50 years. They had three children: Roland, Elmar and Delia. He also had three other children with his first wife. He died on 12 August 2013.\n\n\n", "id": "7702775", "categories": ["Luftwaffe pilots", "People from the Grand Duchy of Baden", "Recipients of the Gold German Cross", "German World War II flying aces", "2013 deaths", "Recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross", "People from Freiburg im Breisgau", "1917 births"], "title": "Hans-Ekkehard Bob"}

In contrast, in conventional routing, routers in the network determine the path incrementally based on the packet's destination. Another routing alternative, label switching, is used in connection-oriented networks such as X.25, frame relay, ATM and MPLS.\n\nSource routing allows easier troubleshooting, improved traceroute, and enables a node to discover all the possible routes to a host. It does not allow a source to directly manage network performance by forcing packets to travel over one path to prevent congestion on another.\n\nMany high-performance interconnects including Myrinet, Quadrics, IEEE 1355, and SpaceWire support source routing.\n\nIn the Internet Protocol, two header options are available which are rarely used: \"strict source and record route\" (SSRR) and \"loose source and record route\" (LSRR). Because of security concerns, packets marked LSRR are frequently blocked on the Internet. If not blocked, LSRR can allow an attacker to spoof its address but still successfully receive response packets.\n\nIn IPv6, two forms of source routing have been developed. The first approach was the Type 0 Routing header . This routing header was designed to support the same use cases as the IPv4 header options. Unfortunately there were several important attacks against this routing header and its utilisation was deprecated. A more secure form of source routing is being developed within the IETF to support the IPv6 version of Segment Routing.\n\nSoftware-defined networking can also be enhanced when source routing is used in the forwarding plane. Studies have shown significant improvements in convergence times as a result of the reduced state that must be distributed by the controller into the network.\n\nWhen using source routing with Myrinet, the sender of the packet prepends the complete route, one byte for every crossbar, to each packet header.\nEach crossbar examines the first routing byte of the packet.\nWhen using source routing, that byte indicates a particular port of that crossbar; when that port becomes available, the router discards that routing byte and sends the rest of the packet out that port.\n\nEach packet traveling through a SpaceWire network can use path addressing (source routing) or logical addressing or some combination.\nThe router examines the first data character of the packet; when it indicates some specific port of the router, the router discards that routing character and sends the rest of the packet out that port.\n\n\n", "id": "7702780", "categories": [], "title": "Source routing"}

It was an alternative to the SRBs.\n\nThe addition of wings (and some form of landing gear) on the S-IC stage would allow the booster to fly back to the Kennedy Space Center, where technicians would then refurbish the booster (by replacing only the five F-1 engines and reusing the tanks and other hardware for later flights).\n\nThe Shuttle would handle space station logistics, while Saturn V would launch components. \nThis would have allowed a space station, using a Skylab or Mir configuration with docking ports, to have been lifted with just a handful of launches.

Once the S-IC was jettisoned, the three onboard high-energy Space Shuttle main engines would then propel the orbiter into LEO, shutting down 6.5 minutes after ignition. The external tank would then be jettisoned, as on the actually flown shuttle configuration, and the orbiter would then perform its mission.\n\nBut because of the need to keep costs down and to allow President Richard Nixon to approve the shuttle program in 1972, NASA decided to utilize segmented solid rocket boosters similar to those used on the Titan III rocket instead of the S-IC, thus ending the Saturn program after the initial Saturn V order was completed.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7702855", "categories": ["Space Shuttle program", "Saturn (rocket family)", "Apollo program"], "title": "Saturn-Shuttle"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702892", "text": "Relational dialectics\n\nRelational dialectics is an interpersonal communication theory about close personal ties and relationships that highlights the tensions, struggles and interplay between contrary tendencies. The theory, proposed respectively by Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery in 1988, defines communication patterns between relationship partners as the result of endemic \"dialectical tensions\".\n\nRelationships are made in dialogue and they can be complicated and dialogue with similarities and differences are necessary. Relational communication theories allow for opposing views or forces to come together in a reasonable way. When making decisions, desires and viewpoints that often contradict one another are mentioned and lead to dialectical tensions. Leslie A. Baxter and Barbara M. Montgomery exemplify these contradictory statements that arise from individuals experience dialectal tensions using common proverbs such as \"opposites attract\", but \"birds of a feather flock together\"; as well as, \"two's company; three's a crowd\" but \"the more the merrier\". This does not mean these opposing tensions are fundamentally troublesome for the relationship; on the contrary, they simply bring forward a discussion of the connection between two parties.\n\nThe relational dialectic is an elaboration on Mikhail Bakhtin's idea that life is an open monologue and humans experience collisions between opposing desires and needs within relational communications. Baxter includes a list of dialectical tensions that reminds us that relationships are constantly changing, and that successful and satisfying relationships require constant attention. Although Baxter's description of relational dialectics is thorough, it is not exact or all inclusive since we all experience different tensions in different ways.\n\nRelational dialectics is the emotional and value-based version of the philosophical dialectic. It is rooted in the dynamism of the yin and yang. Like the classic yin and yang, the balance of emotional values in a relationship is constantly in motion, and any value pushed to its extreme, contains the seed of its opposite. \n\nIn the Western world, the ideas of ying and yang link back to the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who argued that the world was in constant flux (like fire), with creative and destructive forces on both sides of every process. Mikhail Bakhtin, a Russian scholar most known for his work in dialogism, applied Marxist dialectic to literary and rhetorical theory and criticism. He illustrated the tensions that exists in the deep structure of all human experience. For example, he identified that the tension that exists between unity and difference. Bakhtin conceived the human dialectic as two forces analogous to the physical forces \"centripetal\" (emotional forces tending towards unity) and \"centrifugal\" (emotional forces tending towards divergence). Like the Yin and Yang, Bakhtin's forces have no ultimate resolution.\n\nBaxter took the deep structural analysis of Bakhtin and applied it to communication theory. She found a T-Bangha of axes where this dynamic tension operated. Later authors have added other axes.\n\nThere are three main approaches to relational dialectics: monologic, dualistic and dialectic. <br>\n\nThe first approach, monologic approach, frames contradictions as either/or, demonstrating that the contradictions are mutually exclusive or opposite of each other. For example, an individual can either like hot or cold weather. They may not like not a mix of the weather conditions. Monologic approach means as we move closer to one concept, we move further away from the other. <br>\n\nThe second approach, dualistic approach, frames contradictions as two separate entities, showing that they are unrelated in nature. When studying a relationship and one individual in the relationship is evaluated exclusive of his or her interaction with their partner, then this is an example of dualistic approach. <br>\n\nThe third approach, the dialectic approach, contends that multiple points of view play off one another in every contradiction (both/and). When two people are in a relationship, one can desire to be open in the relationship exposing certain parts of his or her life with the other person. At the same time, that individual can also have a sense of self-protection where they may not want to share everything about them with their partner. Both of these feelings can exist within the individual at the same time.\n\nThere are four main concepts that form the backdrop of relational dialectics, as well as four major assumptions. Relational dialectics assumes that \"(1.) relationships are not linear, (2.) relational life is characterized by change, (3.) contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life, and (4.) communication is central to organizing and negotiating relational contradictions\".\n\nThe four core concepts of relational dialectics include: contradiction, totality, process, and praxis.\n\nContradictions are the core concept of relational dialectics. It is the dynamic interplay between unified oppositions. A contradiction is formed \"whenever two tendencies or forces are interdependent (unity) yet mutually negate one another (negation)\". For example, in a relationship one can simultaneously desire intimacy and distance.\n\nTotality suggests that contradictions in a relationship are part of a unified whole and cannot be understood in isolation. In other words, the dialectics cannot be separated and are intrinsically related to each other. For example, the tension between dependence and interdependence cannot be separated from the tension between openness and privacy — both work to condition and define the other.\n\nProcess Relational dialectics must be understood in terms of social processes. Movement, activity, and change are functional properties (Rawlins,1989). For example, instances such as an individual fluctuating between disclosure and secretiveness. In addition, the individual may move between periods of honest and open communication (Miller, 2002, 2005). \n\nPraxis is a philosophical term for the concept of 'practical behavior' or sometimes 'the experience of practicing'. In praxis, the dialectic tensions are created and re-created through the active participation and interaction. In other words, the practical experience of having a relationship exposes one to the imposition of the needs and values of another. As the relationship endures, one's own needs and values become apparent. Praxis focuses on the practical choices individuals make in the midst of the opposing needs and values (dialectical tensions). In turn, the choices and actions themselves create, re-create, and change the nature of the relationship and hence the dialectical tensions themselves.\n\nResearch has recommended theories which further dialectical understanding in relationships, such as in marriage, in the workplace, etc. Relational dialectics further includes the idea of Contextual Dialectics, or rather, the idea that every relationship exists within a specific place within a specific culture. From there we also see the raise of public and private/real and ideal dialectics and the interplay between what is seen on television in public life, versus what is experienced in private lives. Examples of this concept include the viewing of politicians as well as what is viewed on television shows. According to West and Turner, \"the tension of the real and ideal dialectic is featured when we think of television shows like Leave It to Beaver: We receive an idealized message of what family life is like, and then when we look at the families we live in, we have to contend with the troublesome realities of family life. The tension between these two images forms this dialectic\".\n\nAccording to the original relational dialectic model, there were many core tensions (opposing values) in any relationship. These are autonomy and connectedness, favoritism and impartiality, openness and closedness, novelty and predictability, instrumentality and affection, and finally, equality and inequality.\n\nAutonomy and connectedness refers to the desire to have ties and connections with others versus the need to separate oneself as a unique individual. An example of autonomy and connectedness would be an athlete who wants to feel like he/she is a part of a team but also wanting to highlight his/her individual talents. Favoritism and impartiality refers to the desire to be treated fairly and impartially versus the desire to be seen and known as \"special\". For instance, a professor may want to be impartial by creating an attendance policy but makes exceptions for students who participate in class and have good grades, demonstrating favoritism. Openness and closedness refers to the desire to be open and divulge information versus the desire to be exclusive and private. When chatting with a boss about one's weekend, there is the desire to be open, however, closedness is also at play, as certain details are often left out, because of the context. Novelty and predictability suggest that there is a desire for the relationship to be predictable versus the desire for it to be original and new. When creating scheduled meetings for board members, the predictability may lie in a fixed schedule, however the novelty may be in scheduling a varying number of locations to peak interests as well as inspiration. Instrumentality and affection, is the desire for affection to be genuine versus the desire for affection to be motivated by benefits and perceived advantages of the relationship. An example of this would be being in a romantic relationship based on love and affection, but maintaining it for benefits such as financial security. Finally, equality and inequality refers to the desire to be considered as equals versus the desire to develop levels of superiority. A female in the military may seek treatment equivalent to that received by her male colleagues, but requires special barracks and adjusted assignments. \n\nAccording to the theory, while most of us may embrace the ideals of closeness, certainty, and openness in our relationships, the communication is not a straight path towards these goals. Conflicts often produce the exact opposites.\n\nThe table above shows typical dialectical tensions experienced by relational partners based on research done by Baxter and Montgomery showing contrasting efforts in two different ways. The column that displays examples of Internal Dialect shows \"ongoing tensions played out within a relationship\". The column that displays examples of External Dialect shows \"ongoing tensions between a couple and their community\".\n\nIntegration–separation is \"a class of relational dialectics that includes connection–autonomy, inclusion–seclusion, and intimacy–independence.\" Some individual autonomy must be given up to connect to others.\n\nStability–change is \"a class of relational dialectics that includes certainty–uncertainty, conventionally–uniqueness, predictability–surprise, and routine–novelty.\" Things must be consistent but not mundane. There must be a balance between the expected and unexpected in order to keep a relationship.\n\nExpression–nonexpression is \"a class of relational dialectics that includes openness–closedness, revelation–concealment, candor–secrecy, and transparency–privacy\". In a relationship, it is important to keep some things between the two parties, while other parts of the relationship are okay to allow the public to know about.\n\nAccording to Michaela Meyer, \"relational dialectics theory exposes tensions within interpersonal relationships while at the same time it assumes a continual maintenance and repair of these tensions. As a result, relational dialectics theory is incredibly useful for defining how tensions are managed within relationships.\" Extensive research has been done regarding the role dialectical tensions play in relationships, as well as the various factors that influence the tensions and the degree to which they affect the relationship. Through studies of romantic relationships, long distance relationships, friendships, and family relationships, researchers have observed the existence and frequency of certain dialectical tensions within various types of relationships.\n\nAccording to Marsha Linehan, founder of DBT or Dialectical Behavior Therapy, some people have great difficulty resolving the dialectic tensions that arise in relationships. Many people with personality disorders, potentially caused or made worse by dysfunctional upbringing, especially Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and some others, perpetually vascilate between the poles of the dialectic conflict, with resulting instability causing problems in living that are not mediated by other therapy modalities. In DBT's biosocial theory, some people \"have a biological predisposition for emotional dysregulation, and their social environment validates maladaptive behavior. \n\nA study of 25 heterosexual married couples was designed to determine what types of dialectical tensions were most prevalent in antagonistic conflicts between spouses. Larry Erbert found that the Openness v. Closedness dialectic was most commonly referenced through examples by participants. Research conducted by Baxter and Montgomery confirmed this finding, and broke the dialectic down into four subcategories to further analyze its existence in romantic relationships.\n\n\nResearch has been conducted to examine the autonomy-connection dialectic when dealing with termination of romantic relationships. In Erin Sahlestein and Tim Dun's study they found that, \"participants' joint conversations and their breakup accounts reflect the two basic forms of contradiction. Both antagonistic and non-antagonistic struggles were evident in these data\". Furthermore, the study discovered that while normally break-ups are retroactively studied, the autonomy-connection dialectic is actually in full swing throughout the termination process as opposed to previous thought of as a move from connection to autonomy.\n\nA study measuring the display of symbols by lesbian couples, revealed that while same-sex couples experience similar challenges that opposite-sex partners experience, there are unique challenges that arise to these same-sex couples. These unique problems in turn give rise to unique dialectical tensions within the relationship.\n\nIn a study that focused on dialectics in second marriages, six tensions unique to remarriages emerged.\n\nThree tensions related to the remarried dyad:\n\n\nThree tensions also emerged from the remarried dyad and their social networks:\n\n\nBased on research by Sahlstein, the uncertainty v. certainty dialectic is the most prevailing dialectic found in long-distance relationships. Her work exposed uncertainty v. certainty as a competing yet complementary need. In interviews conducted with couples engaged in long distance relationships, contradictions emerged. For example, couples were found to plan interactions in order to obtain a level of spontaneity. Within this, three different forms of the praxis of relational dialectics emerged:\n\nWilliam Rawlins has examined the role of relational dialectics in regard to friendships. The tension of instrumentality v. affection was found to be the most central to this type of relationship. Within friendships, importance is placed on the ability to discern the level of affection for \"real\" friendships opposed to instrumentality for \"fake\" friendships. Aristotle's \"friendship of virtue\" notion of caring for friends without instrumental purposes exemplifies this point. The dichotomy of instrumentality v. affection cannot be ignored within friendships, as affection may be offered in order to receive instrumental aid from friends. This interweaving of concepts is what distinguishes different types of friendships. While this remains true, the subjectivity of the friends in question ultimately determines the outcome of how heavily instrumentality v. affection is applied.\n\nIn the workplace\n\nBlended Relationships are close friends that are a part of the same work environment. Dialectical tensions occur in organizations as individuals attempt to balance their roles as employees while maintaining established friendships within their occupations. It is not necessary, however, to have a friend in organizations to experience dialectical contradictions. Stress occurs frequently on the individual level as human needs and desires oppose.\n Sibling relationships \n\nRelational dialectics can be applied when considering the significant change in family life that siblings experience when one sibling moves out of the family home for the first time as part of the transition into adulthood. As one sibling begins a new phase of life, this change is often accompanied by new friendships or romantic relationships that occur in his/her new lifestyle, along with a new geographic separation, both of which result in a change in communication. As the newly absent sibling begins a new lifestyle beyond his/her home, the pre-existing sibling relationship goes through various changes and transitions.\n\nIn a study conducted on discursive struggles among siblings experiencing transition, all participants acknowledged that moving away from their sibling(s) resulted in a discursive struggle between the old and new meanings in the sibling relationship. Two specific discursive struggles were identified:\n\nWhile participants addressed the varying tensions involved with lifestyle transitions, 8 of the 19 participants in the study expressed that moving away from their sibling strengthened their connection and appreciation for their brother(s) and/or sister(s).\n\nIn a study focusing on the adult stepchild perceptions of communication in the stepchild-stepparent relationship, three contradictions were found to be experienced by the stepchildren participants:\n\nIn another study, researchers aimed to identify the contradictions that were perceived by stepchildren when characterizing the ways that familial interactions caused them to feel caught in the middle between parents. The participants expressed that they wanted to be centered in the family while, at the same time, they hoped to avoid being caught in the middle of two opposing parents. The main contradiction identified in the study was similar to the autonomy-connection dialectic: stepchildren desired the freedom to communicate and enact the desired relationship with their parents. However, these stepchildren also felt the need to manage the constraints that resulted from parental communication, particularly when both parents did not cooperate with one another. While the stepchildren wanted to know what was happening, at the same time, they also wanted to be protected, resulting in a second dialectic of control-restraint. Through this study, the researchers believe that openness-closeness dialectic between parents and their children is important to building functional stepfamily relationships.\n\nOne study, focused on the relationship and communication between college-aged stepchildren and their nonresidential parents, found two underlying contradictions: parenting and not parenting, and openness and closeness. Many participants expressed that they wanted their nonresidential parent to be actively involved in parenting them but did not desire it once they were. Participants also expressed that while they wanted open and intimate communication with their nonresidential parents, they felt that they could not closely communicate because of the nonresidential parent's lack of familiarity with the child's everyday life.\n\nRelational dialectics theory can be applied to the context of health care, specifically end-of-life care, providing a system for caregiver communication that contains tensions and challenges. The quality of the end-of-life journey is influenced by how these tensions are managed. Relational dialectics theory is an applicable framework for investigating the ongoing communication between physicians and their patients/family members during the process of end-of-life care.\n\nWhen making choices about end-of-life medical care, family members, friends, or surrogate decision makers often experience feelings of tension and burden. Decision-makers must deal with the relational and moral tensions that come with such decision-making. Family members in charge of making end-of-life decisions often face conflicting emotions between holding on and letting go; recognizing the need to let a patient go while wanting to continue fighting to keep a loved one alive.\n\nIn a study that focused on the communication tensions perceived among the Maori culture during the end-of-life journey, it was found that despite the culture's focus on collectivism and its emphasis on harmony, four communication tensions existed between caregivers (family and friends) and patients: autonomy and connection, conflict and connection, isolation and connection, and balancing the needs of self and other.\n\nThe human grieving process is marked by relational dialectics. After the death of a child, bereaved parents often experience tension between presence and absence by grieving their child's permanent absence while still experiencing an emotional bond toward the deceased child. Bereaved parents may also experience tension between openness and closeness, where they desire to discuss their feelings with friends or family, yet they are hesitant to share because of the potentially negative reactions they could receive.\n\nOne study, aimed at focusing on how families make sense of contradictory discourses, found two discursive contradictions: family members' wishes vs. patient's wishes, and emotionality vs. rationality. Through interviews with participants who had experienced the loss of a loved one, researchers concluded that many of the end of life decisions made by family members, patients, and doctors were centered on making sense of the simultaneous desires to hold on and to let go. Participants recognized that they experienced tension between their own preferences and the preferences of a loved one, and with that, experienced the tension between desiring to make decisions based on emotions versus making decisions based on rationality.\n\nDialectical contradictions have also been found among parents who have lost a child. One study found that two primary dialectical contradictions occurred for parents who had experienced the death of a child: openness-closeness, and presence-absence. Parents experienced openness-closeness when they desired to talk about their child and their loss, yet they perceived the outcome as risky, especially if they sensed that friends and family wished for the parents to move on. Participants explained that they were able to manage this contradiction by being selective with their disclosure and taking control over the communicative situation. When dealing with the presence-absence dialectic, bereaved parents experienced tensions between the ongoing bond that they experienced with their child, and the physical absence of the child. Participants expressed that when people were not willing to remember their dead child, the physical absence of the child was deeply felt. However, when people chose to remember the deceased child, the parent experienced feelings of comfort and continual bonding with the child.\n\nUnderstanding Autistic Communication\n\nAs relational dialects’ aim is to analyse competence during interaction, it can suggest an approach to researching on communication competence among people which are with autism spectrum disorders. Applying relational dialects theory to studying interactions of autistic individuals starts from approaching autistic individual as an actor during the interaction and deeming competence a result of the interaction. This approach can delve into how social contexts, expectations, and roles contribute to the autistics’ competent communication. The investigation of dialects includes integration-separation, expression-privacy, and stability-change enhance the understanding of the communication between people with autism spectrum disorders.\n\nDialogue is typically a conversation between two or more people. These conversations are what constitute relationships, as communication is the very foundation of any relationship. According to Cools, \"the four important concepts that form the foundation of dialogism 1) the self and the other situated in contradictory forces, 2) unfinalizability, 3) the chronotope and the carnivalesque, and 4) heteroglossia and utterance\". Similarity, in dialogue the following components are the most important: constitutive dialogue, utterance chains, dialectical flux, aesthetic moment, and critical sensibility.\n\n'Constitutive dialogue'\n\nWhile some theorists, along with Baxter, may argue that communication is simply a feature in a relationship, examining constitutive dialogue suggests that communication is actually what creates and maintains a relationship instead. According to Baxter, \"a constitutive approach to communication asks how communication defines, or constructs, the social world, including our selves and our personal relationships. From a constitutive perspective, then, persons and relationships are not analytically separable from communication; instead, communication constitutes these phenomena\" When initial researchers studied relationships, they found that similarities, backgrounds, and interests are usually what hold people together while self-disclosure is the root of these components. Dialogic researchers would argue that differences are just as important as similarities and they are both discovered through dialogue.\n\n'Utterance chains'\n\nTo understand utterance chains, we must know that an utterance is what a person says in one turn of a conversation. When utterances are \"linked to competing discourses\", they are considered utterance chains. Baxter believes that there are \"four links on the chain where the struggle of competing discourses can be heard.\" These are: cultural ideologies, relational history, non-yet spoken response of partner or utterance, and normative evaluation of third party to utterance. Baxter also suggest that to understand an utterance, we must also understand the discourse. She posits \"in the broadest sense, a discourse is a cultural system of meaning that circulates among a group's members and which makes our talk sensical. for example in the United States the discourse of individualism helps us to understand and value an utterance such as, 'I need to find myself first before I commit to a serious relationship with another person'\".\n\n'Dialectical flux'\n\nA dialectical flux is \"the unpredictable, unfinalizable, indeterminate nature of personal relationships\". Relationships are complicated and intertwined with dialectical tensions. Spiraling inversion and segmentation are two strategies that Baxter and Montgomery have established to respond to this complexity. Spiraling inversion is generally a no-win situation; a struggle between two different thought processes. For example, if you were to do something your parents did not approve of, you could lie about it, but your parents might yell at you for lying. And on the other hand, you could tell them upfront, and they could be completely quiet in shock. Segmentation is pertaining to more than one role in a relationship that must be altered depending on the situation. For example, if you were working at your father's shop as a part-time job, he would be considered your father AND your boss. This could mean that he has different expectations of you in different circumstances and his attitude towards you might change between roles.\n\n'Aesthetic moment'\n\nAesthetic moments are brief incidents in a relationship that bring participants together through the use of dialogue. There is a temporary feeling of wholeness felt between partners involved in this dialogue. It is easy to see examples of aesthetic moments in romantic relationships, such as a first kiss or a reciting of wedding vows, but these moments can be experienced by anyone.\n\n'Critical sensibility'\n\nAccording to Griffin, critical sensibility is \"an obligation to critique dominant voices, especially those that suppress opposing viewpoints; a responsibility to advocate for those who are muted\". This means that both sides of a dialogue are equal to one another. No one person is more powerful or dominant than the other, and they are able to communicate without these imbalances interfering. This does not mean that the dialogue is free of competing discourses as listed in Utterance Chains.\n\nWhen communicating, we must understand that morals do not apply for all people. Sometimes lying can be entirely minor in communication, but there are oftentimes that lying can majorly affect the perspective of those being lied to. There are several times where most people would justify a \"white lie\", or a lie that causes no harm. For instance, if your mother was in the hospital, you could tell her she still looked beautiful, even if her appearance was far from it because it would make her feel better. Other actions that are only followed through based on whether they have a positive or negative outcome are called \"consequential ethics\". According to Sissela Bok, \"lies drag around an initial negative weight that must be factored into ethical equations\". Bok believes in the \"principle of veracity\" which says that truthful statements are preferable to lies in the absence of special circumstances that overcome the negative weight. Ethics plays a major role in the study of interpersonal communication, particularly relational dialectics. In an area where contradictions seem like the norm, it is even more important to share the truth. Incorporating varying and often times opposite view points is critical because communication is grounded in human nature which forces ethics.\n\nAccording to theorist Leslie Baxter, there are three major limitations in the work of relational dialectics theory. Baxter claims that her work has been \"too distanced from naturally occurring talk between relating parties\", and claims that the theory needs a firmer empirical base when applied to talk between relating parties. Naturally occurring talk between relating parties could be qualitative work utilizing the observation method of relating parties or small groups. Non-participative or participative observation would be appropriate for continued study of relational dialectics theory. Baxter also believes that more future work needs to include multiple voices instead of focusing on the more popular research on the dialectics between \"two voices\". Baxter posits that relational dialectics, opposite infers binary opposites when “many discourses can be competing at once”. Lastly, Baxter shares that future research should focus on discourse through time, such as studying dialogue and how it transforms over a longer period of time. The latter would take significant time so it would be studies that incorporate earlier works compared to more recent work.\n\n\nPublications ;\n\n<nowiki>\n", "id": "7702892", "categories": ["Communication theory"], "title": "Relational dialectics"}

While it simulcasts sister station WSGB full-time, WVAR breaks away for sports broadcasts.\n\nWVAR first went on the air on November 16, 1957, and first broadcast at 1280 AM under the call letters WMNF. The original owner was Royal Broadcasting Company, of which Herman Dotson served as president and Art Grunewald as general manager. Studios were located along Cemetery Road in Richwood. By 1959, the call letters were changed to WVAR, as they remain today.\n\nOn January 1, 1965, WVAR was sold to R & S Broadcasting. Carl Gainer was the new company president, and Virgil Graves became General Manager. In 1968, WVAR moved from its dial position of 1280 kHz to 600 kHz. The station retained its daytime-only broadcast hours and output power of 1,000 watts.\n\nIn 1991, WVAR moved its studios and offices to 713 Main Street in Summersville, but would maintain a local presence in Richwood at 2 Rhododendron Drive, formerly known as Cemetery Road. On December 24, 1996, after more than 30 years of ownership, WVAR was sold by R & S Broadcasting to J & K Broadcasting. The ownership change also resulted in the pairing of an FM sister station, WAFD, which had gone on the air earlier that year with a southern and country gospel format.\n\nIn mid-February 2003, an ice storm that ravaged the southern part of West Virginia toppled the WVAR broadcasting antenna atop Hinkle Mountain which overlooks Richwood. In the following summer the station and its owner raised funds to erect a new antenna. The station was closed with a dark license while funds were sought to replace it.\n\nOn March 13, 2007, J & K Broadcasting, Inc. sold WVAR to Summit Media Broadcasting, LLC for $1.24 million in a transaction that included sister FM station WAFD in Webster Springs. Summit Media also owns WDBS-FM and WSGB-AM. Studios were moved to 202 Back Fork Street in Webster Springs.\n\nOn May 15, 2007, WVAR dropped its country format and began simulcasting sister WSGB-AM's oldies format as \"The Mighty 1490\". That October, Summit Media filed an application with the FCC to waive main studio requirements for WVAR, which would allow on-air operations to be co-located with WSGB and other stations in Summit Media's ownership group.\n\nTwo months later, another application was filed informing the FCC that Summit Media had taken the station silent due to Summit Media's inability to successfully meet FCC-required staffing needs at the Webster Springs studio. The FCC granted the application to keep the station silent in January 2008 until granting permission for the studio waiver later that year. However, Summit Media kept the station silent for another year due to technical renovations being delayed due to the lack of available workforce.\n\nIn November 2009, Summit Media filed an application to rebroadcast WVAR's signal over FM translator W251AY, licensed to Birch River. The translator, licensed to operate at 98.1 mHz, broadcasts at 250 watts at a height of 256 m above average terrain. The translator, which has been on the air since 2004, had been previously used to rebroadcast the signal of sister FM station WDBS.\n\n", "id": "7702893", "categories": [], "title": "WVAR"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702910", "text": "Oboe Concerto (Marcello)\n\nThe Oboe Concerto in D minor, S D935, is an early 18th-century concerto for oboe, strings and continuo attributed to the Venetian composer Alessandro Marcello. The earliest extant manuscript containing Johann Sebastian Bach's solo keyboard arrangement of the concerto, BWV 974, dates from around 1715. As a concerto for oboe, strings and continuo its oldest extant sources date from 1717: that year it was printed in Amsterdam, and a C minor variant of the concerto, S Z799, was written down.\n\nBach's keyboard version was published as an arrangement of a concerto by Antonio Vivaldi in the 19th century. In 1923 the C minor version of the oboe concerto was published as a composition by Benedetto Marcello, Alessandro's brother. In the second half of the 20th century several publications indicated Alessandro again as the composer of the piece, as it had been in its early 18th-century print, and the oboe concerto was again published in its D minor version.\n\nAs well oboe concerto versions and versions based on Bach's arrangement kept repertoire in the 20th and 21st century.\n\nThe Concerto in D minor, S D935, was published by Jeanne Roger in Amsterdam in 1717, as a \"Concerto a Cinque\" (concerto in five parts) for oboe (soloist), strings (two violin and one viola parts) and continuo composed by Alessandro Marcello. No publication date appears in the print: although the year of publication is, depending on author, sometimes given as \"ca. 1714-1717\" or \"1716\" it can be inferred from the consecutive testaments of the publisher's father (Estienne Roger) and from the sequence of publication numbers. The publication presents the melody lines unadorned, that is: it is left to the performing musician to embellish melodies with ornaments such as trills, mordents and grace notes. Alessandro Marcello published most of his works under a pseudonym (Eterio Stinfalico): the oboe concerto publication was an exception in that sense as it used his real name.\n\nIn his Weimar period (1708–17) Johann Sebastian Bach arranged several concertos by Venetian composers, most of them by Antonio Vivaldi, for solo keyboard. In July 1713 Prince Johann Ernst returned to Weimar from the Netherlands with several compositions by Italian masters. Vivaldi's Op. 3, \"L'estro Armonico\" had been published in Amsterdam in 1711, and there is little doubt that the Prince brought this edition, containing twelve concertos, to Weimar in 1713, as Bach apparently used this print for five of his solo keyboard arrangements. The Prince, who also composed Italianate concertos, presumably encouraged Bach to produce solo keyboard arrangements of such works. As the Prince left Weimar in July 1714 it is estimated that most of Bach's solo keyboard arrangements of Italian and Italianate concertos originated in the period from July 1713 to July 1714. That is, at least those arrangements that could be performed on a harpsichord without pedalboard, while the Weimar court organ (which would be needed for arrangements including pedals such as BWV 592–597) would have been unavailable for undergoing repairs in this period.\n\nBach's \"manualiter\" arrangement, BWV 974, of the Marcello concerto was apparently not based on the Amsterdam edition, but must have been based on a (lost) manuscript version of the concerto that circulated before it was printed. The July 1713 to July 1714 timeframe may fit for the production of the arrangement of this concerto, although an earlier or later date is possible too. Bach's autograph of the solo keyboard arrangement is lost, but the arrangement was copied around 1715 by Bach's second cousin Johann Bernhard, as the third item in a manuscript containing 12 of Johann Sebastian's keyboard transcriptions of Italian and Italianate concertos. In 1739 Johann Bernhard's son Johann Ernst wrote a title page for this collection, suggesting that the collection contained Vivaldi arrangements for organ exclusively. He may have intended this title page for the first concerto in the collection only (which was indeed an arrangement of a Vivaldi concerto), but an unknown hand later added the number \"XII\" before the title, thus causing the misunderstanding that all 12 were Vivaldi arrangements. Another copy of Bach's arrangement indicates \"Marcello\" (without first name) as the composer of the original work, and J. S. Bach as the arranger. That copy, specifying harpsichord as the intended instrument for the arrangement, originated after Johann Bernhard's, but may have been copied from an earlier stage of Bach's arrangement. Another manuscript containing Bach's arrangement of Marcello's oboe concerto indicated \"J. S. B.\" as composer on the title page, without mentioning an earlier model, or its composer, for the composition.\n\nThe ornamentation as indicated in Bach's keyboard version of the concerto works well on harpsichord, but is less suitable for performance on an early 18th-century oboe. Nonetheless Bach's ornamentation has been used for 20th-century publications of the oboe concerto – the ornamentation causes fewer problems when performed on a modern oboe. Editions of the D minor version of the oboe concerto with an ornamentation which is better in line with the possibilities of a baroque oboe have been proposed since the late 20th century.\n\nAnother transcription of the concerto, as concerto a 5 for oboe, strings and continuo in C minor, is found in a 1717 manuscript. The type of errors in this manuscript seems to suggest that the transposition from D minor to C minor may have been produced by its scribes while copying. This manuscript writes the composer's name as \"Marcello\" without specifying a first name: as Alessandro's brother Benedetto was far better known as a composer by the name Marcello, later generations would interpret the title of the manuscript as referring to the better known of the \"Marcello\" composers.\n\nThe piece has three movements:\n\nThe concerto survives in different printed and manuscript versions, one of these in C minor.\n\nThe concerto has also been recorded played on a piccolo trumpet - a notoriously challenging transcription due to the breath control and tight embouchure required for its sustained passages in the higher register.\n\nManuscripts\n\nScore publications\n\nWritings\n\n", "id": "7702910", "categories": ["Compositions by Alessandro Marcello", "1715 compositions", "1710s in music", "Oboe concertos", "Compositions in D minor"], "title": "Oboe Concerto (Marcello)"}

It is named for Russian physicists Ilya Frank and Igor Tamm who developed the theory of the Cherenkov effect in 1937, for which they were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958.\n\nWhen a charged particle moves faster than the phase speed of light in a medium, electrons interacting with the particle can emit coherent photons while conserving energy and momentum. This process can be viewed as a decay. See Cherenkov radiation and nonradiation condition for an explanation of this effect.\n\nThe energy formula_1 emitted per unit length travelled by the particle per unit of frequency formula_2 is:\n\nprovided that formula_4. Here formula_5 and formula_6 are the frequency-dependent permeability and index of refraction of the medium respectively, formula_7 is the electric charge of the particle, formula_8 is the speed of the particle, and formula_9 is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nCherenkov radiation does not have characteristic spectral peaks, as typical for fluorescence or emission spectra. The relative intensity of one frequency is approximately proportional to the frequency. That is, higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) are more intense in Cherenkov radiation. This is why visible Cherenkov radiation is observed to be brilliant blue. In fact, most Cherenkov radiation is in the ultraviolet spectrum; the sensitivity of the human eye peaks at green, and is very low in the violet portion of the spectrum.\n\nThe total amount of energy radiated per unit length is:\n\nThis integral is done over the frequencies formula_11 for which the particle's speed formula_8 is greater than speed of light of the media formula_13. The integral is convergent (finite) because at high frequencies the refractive index becomes less than unity and for extremely high frequencies it becomes unity.\n\nConsider a charged particle moving relativistically along formula_14-axis in a medium with refraction index formula_15 with a constant velocity formula_16. Start with Maxwell's equations (in Gaussian units) in the wave form and take the Fourier transformation:\n\nformula_17\n\nformula_18\n\nFor a charge moving with velocity formula_8, the density and charge density can be expressed as formula_20 and formula_21, taking the Fourier transformation gives:\n\nformula_22 \n\nformula_23\n\nSubstituting this density and charge current into the wave equation, we can solve for the Fourier-form potentials:\n\nformula_24 and formula_25\n\nUsing the definition of the electromagnetic fields in terms of potentials, we then have the Fourier-form of the electric and magnetic field:\n\nformula_26 and formula_27\n\nTo find the radiated energy, we consider electric field as a function of frequency at some perpendicular distance from the particle trajectory, say, at formula_28, where formula_29 is the impact parameter. It is given by the inverse Fourier transform:\n\nformula_30\n\nFirst we compute formula_14-component formula_32 of the electric field (parallel to formula_33):\n\nformula_34\n\nFor brevity we define formula_35. Breaking the integral apart into formula_36, the formula_37 integral can immediately be integrated by the definition of the Dirac Delta:\n\nformula_38\n\nThe integral over formula_39 has the value formula_40, giving:\n\nformula_41\n\nThe last integral over formula_42 is in the form of a modified (Macdonald) Bessel function, giving the evaluated parallel component in the form:\n\nformula_43\n\nOne can follow a similar pattern of calculation for the other fields components arriving at:\n\nformula_44 and formula_45\n\nWe can now consider the radiated energy formula_1 per particle traversed distance formula_47. It can be expressed through the electromagnetic energy flow formula_48 through the surface of an infinite cylinder of radius formula_49 around the path of the moving particle, which is given by the integral of the Poynting vector formula_50 over the cylinder surface:\n\nformula_51\n\nThe integral over formula_52 at one instant of time is equal to the integral at one point over all time. Using formula_53:\n\nformula_54\n\nConverting this to the frequency domain:\n\nformula_55\n\nTo go into the domain of Cherenkov radiation, we now consider perpendicular distance formula_29 much greater than atomic distances in a medium, that is, formula_57. With this assumption we can expand the Bessel functions into their asymptotic form:\n\nformula_58\n\nformula_59 and formula_60\n\nThus:\n\nformula_61\n\nIf formula_62 has a positive real part (usually true), the exponential will cause the expression to vanish rapidly at large distances, meaning all the energy is deposited near the path. However, this isn't true when formula_63 is purely imaginary - this instead causes the exponential to become 1 and then is independent of formula_49, meaning some of the energy escapes to infinity as radiation - this is Cherenkov radiation.\n\nformula_63 is purely imaginary if formula_66 is real and formula_67. That is, when formula_66 is real, Cherenkov radiation has the condition that formula_69. This is the statement that the speed of the particle much be larger than the phase velocity of electromagnetic fields in the medium at frequency formula_11 in order to have Cherenkov radiation.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702996", "text": "Hughes v Lord Advocate\n\nThe case's main significance is that, after the shift within the common law of negligence from strict liability to a reasonable standard of care, this case advocated a middle way, namely: \nThis idea was neither developed nor expanded upon, and only one year later the claimant in \"Doughty v Turner Manufacturing\" obtained no remedy \"via\" this \"middle way\". However, the case was followed in subsequent cases on occupiers' liability.\n\nOne evening in November 1958 two boys aged 8 and 10 were walking down Russell Road, Edinburgh where some Post Office workers were repairing cables under the street. The men had opened a manhole and had erected a weather tent over it, with an access ladder inside. From mid-afternoon onwards, the tent had four red paraffin warning lamps. The workmen left around 5pm for a tea break nearby; before leaving, they withdrew the ladder, leaving it outside the tent.\n\nWhile the workmen were out, the boys arrived and started meddling with the equipment. They picked up one of the lamps and entered the tent. They took the ladder and proceeded to explore the manhole, after which they safely climbed out again. The younger boy tripped over the lamp, which fell into the manhole and broke. The paraffin leaked and vaporised, causing an explosion with flames reaching up to thirty feet. The impact of the blast caused the 8-year old to fall into the hole and suffer severe burn injuries.\n\nThe question arose whether the Post Office workers had been negligent in leaving the site unattended with the lamps burning. Under Scots law, they owed a duty of reasonable care to prevent the site becoming an \"allurement\" for the boys; had they discharged this duty? On the other hand, the children were trespasser and possibly contributorily negligence. A crucial issue was the likelihood (or foreseeability) of the presence of children on Russell Road, and whether the explosion causing the serious burn injuries was of \"different type than that could have been foreseeable\".\n\nThe court of first instance, the First Division of the Court of Session, limited the liability of the Post Office on the grounds that although the danger to children was foreseeable the accident itself was not foreseeable. The defence had argued that the boys were not only trespassers but also contributorily negligeny, but the court responded that the Post Office did not have any exclusive interest in the middle of the road to support a claim of trespass; and taking into consideration the youth of the boy, it was agreed that he was NOT contributorily negligence; and these points were dropped on appeal to the House of Lords).\n\nLord Jenkins addressed the duty of issue of care established by Lord Atkin in \"Donoghue v. Stevenson,\", saying: \"the Post Office had brought on the public highway apparatus capable of constituting a source of danger to passer-by ... It was therefore their duty that such passerby, \"neighbour\" in the language of \"Donoghue v. Stevenson\", were, so far as reasonably practicable, protected from the various obstacles or allurements, which the workmen had brought to the site. It is clear that the safety precautions taken by the Post Office did not in this instance measure up to Lord Atkin's test.\"\n\nLord Morris stated that \"exercising an ordinary, and certainly not an over-exacting, degree of prevention the workmen should have decided, when the tea-break came, that someone had better be left in charge who could repel the intrusion of inquisitive children,\" thereby casting doubt that the workers had discharged their duty of care.\n\nIn both the First Division and in the House of Lords, the defence argued that it was unforeseeable that children might be on Russell Road, \"a quiet road, some four hundred yards away from any houses\". Lord Morris opined (following the judgement of Lord Ordinary) that \"if, of, course, there was no likelihood that children might appear, different considerations would apply. But children did appear, and I find no reason to differ from the conclusion of the Lord Ordinary that the presence of children in the immediate vicinity of the shelter was reasonably to be anticipated.\"\n\nLord Guest declared that the burden of proof that the presence of children lay with the respondent; and on the facts there was insufficient evidence to do this. Lord Guest accepted that it was reasonable to anticipate the danger that might arise by meddling children, and that that, \"... the normal dangers of such children falling into the manhole and injured by a lamp were such that a reasonable man would not have ignored them.\"\n\nIt was accepted that the explosion causing the burns was a result of paraffin leaking from the lamp. According to Lord Reid, the boy's injuries from burns was foreseeable. Although the extent of the injury of burn was greater than might have been expected, this was no defence. However, if the injury were of a different kind than the foreseeable type the defender might have escaped liability.\n\nLord Reid continued that as the cause of the accident – the explosion from paraffin lamp – was known, it left no scope to allege the accident was caused from some unknown source, rather than the fault of respondent. Lord Reid concluded that the accident in question \"was but a variant of foreseeable\" and it mattered not it may have arisen in an unforeseeable manner.\n\nLord Jenkins agreed, finding no justification to hold someone liable if the accident had occurred from the burning of lamp but not if the lamp had exploded.\n\nLord Morris agreed, saying that the injury suffered by the boy was of a higher degree, but was \"of the kind or type of accident which was foreseeable\". He said the respondent \"should not escape liability just because they could not foresee the exact way\" in which the boy might play with the equipment, or the way in which he might get hurt. Allowing the appeal, Lord Morris said there was a duty owed by the respondent to safeguard the boy against the type or kind of occurrence which in fact happened and which resulted in his injuries, and the defenders are not absolved from liability because they didn't envisage \"the precise concatenation of circumstances which lead up to the accident.\"\n\nLord Guest pointed out that for making a coherent chain of causation it is not necessary to follow the minute details leading up to the accident to be reasonably foreseeable, but only that \"the type of accident caused was of a foreseeable type\". He was of the view that the lower courts wrongly gave more emphasis on the fact on explosion; to Lord Guest it was a non-essential element. He gave more emphasis on the fact whether burning of paraffin outside the lamp was a reasonable foreseeable event. The lower courts had already concluded these events as a reasonable foreseeable event, but they were of the view the explosion was an unforeseeable event. Lord Guest argued this as a \"fallacious\" claim. Lord Guest concluded that the accident and the injuries sustained by the boys should have been reasonably foreseen by Post Office employees, who were in breach of duty to take adequate protection against the accident.\n\nLord Pearce cited the case of \"The Wagon Mound\" which held that a person is not liable if the accident is of a different type than the type which was foreseen by the person. It would be unjust to check each and every details of the foreseeability test too minutely when the case deals with things that can be allurement to children leads to an accident and hard to foresee the exact way in which the accident may take place.\n\nIn sum, all the judges allowed the boy's appeal. The decision was followed in \"Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council\",\n\n(For a similar case arising under US law, see \"Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad\", a case which had been influential upon the court in \"Donoghue v Stevenson\").\n\n\n", "id": "7702996", "categories": ["United Kingdom tort case law", "1963 in Scotland", "Scottish case law", "Delict", "Court of Session cases", "History of Edinburgh", "House of Lords cases", "Negligence case law", "Causality", "1963 in case law"], "title": "Hughes v Lord Advocate"}

It is a derived form of Yakshagana—a classical dance or musical form of art from the same region.\n\nA typical Tala-Maddale show consists of veteran artists sitting in a circular fashion along with a Bhagavata (the singer, with \"Tala\" or pair of small hand cymbals) and a \"Maddale\" (a type of drum) player. Artists play the roles of characters in stories, typically, from Ramayana, Mahabharata, and other puranas. Some consider them as a good presentation of oratorial skills.\n\nArtists are normally well versed with the Hindu epics and puranas. Kannada language is the normal medium of communication. Tala-Maddale performances are mostly held during the night, the traditional reason being that in ancient times, people finished their work by this time and assembled in temples to watch Tala Maddale. It is organized by either hobbyists who are interested in the art at their houses or as a public event in villages and towns.\n\nAs is common in many Indian art forms, A Tala Maddale performance is commenced with a puja to Lord Ganesh (the Hindu God of knowledge, learning and art) with a prayer song by Bhagavatha. Usually this song is \"Gajamukhadavage ganapage\". This tends to be followed by a combination of pre scripted as well as ex tempore debates between the artists. Hence, while the average length of a performance is about three hours, it can extend depending upon the debate. Due to the latter, artists are expected to be well versed with the subject matter too. In ancient times, Tala-Maddale performances often took the form of all-night performances, from 7 pm right up to 6 am.\n\nSubjects of Tala Maddale performances normally focus on episodes from the Hindu epics of Bhagavata and Puranas. However, episodes have also been created on other more current issues, some of which include the Second World War, the Tashkent Agreement, the Indian freedom struggle \"(Swarajya Vijaya)\" and computerisation \"(Ganakasura Kalaga)\".\n\nSome of the popular Tala maddale artists are Sheni Gopala Krishna Bhat, Kerekai Krishna Bhat, Kerekai Umakant Bhat, Polali Shankaranarayana Shastri, Shankaranarayana Samaga, Matti Subba Rao, Vasudeva Samaga, Prabhakara Joshi, M.V. Hegde, Kumble Sundar Rao, M.L. Samaga, Padekallu Vishnu Bhat, Sadashiva Alva Talapady, Appu Nayak Athrady, Ramana Acharya and Prashanth Belur. Artha vaibhava or the grandeur of dialogues tends to be a highlight of these performances relished by the rasikas (audience).\n\nIn August 2016, the story of the Indian Freedom Struggle, Swarajya Vijaya, was enacted in Tala Maddale in the outer yard of the Sri Ananteshwara Temple at Rajangana, Karnataka. The episode (prasanga) had been written by M.V. Hegde. A similar Tala Maddale performance related to the Indian freedom struggle had been held at this very place on 14 August 1947 when India achieved freedom from British Colonial powers.\n\nYou may watch a video clip of Taala Maddale ತಾಳ ಮದ್ದಲೆ session here.\n\nIntroduction to Maddale https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbPtmXeIowQ\n", "id": "7703002", "categories": ["Culture of Karnataka", "Performing arts in India"], "title": "Tala-Maddale"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7703024", "text": "Tom Hickathrift\n\nTom Hickathrift (or sometimes Jack Hickathrift) is a legendary figure of East Anglian English folklore — a character similar to Jack the Giant Killer. He famously battled a giant, and is sometimes said to be a giant himself, though normally he is just represented as possessing giant-like strength.\n\nVarious stories of his exploits have grown up. In one version he is fabled to have been a simple labourer at the time of the Norman Conquest and to have killed a giant in the marsh at Tilney, Norfolk armed only with an axle-tree stuck into a cartwheel. When his makeshift weapon broke he grabbed a \"lusty rawboned miller\" and used him as a weapon instead. This exploit earned him the governorship of Thanet. At the church in Walpole St Peter there is a dent in the ground, where it is said a cannonball landed after he threw it to scare away the devil (in this version Tom is a giant).\n\nIn the fairy tale as told by Joseph Jacobs, Tom lived in marsh of the Isle of Ely and although initially lazy and gluttonous, he was prodigiously tall and it soon became apparent that he had the strength of twenty men. Various proofs of his strength are given: he carried twenty hundredweight of straw and a tree as if they weighed nothing, kicked a football so far that nobody could find it and turned the tables on four men who tried to rob him. He eventually got a job carting beer in Wisbech, but the long journey tired him, so one day he cut across the land of the Wisbech Giant. The giant took this badly and fetched his club to beat Tom, but at this point Tom took the axle-tree and cartwheel and fought the giant. After a furious battle the giant was killed. Tom took his land and was from then on held in esteem by the people of the area.\n\nJacobs cites his source as the chapbook in the Pepysian Library from around 1660, edited by G. L. Gomme. Gomme's introduction states that there was evidence that an axle-tree and cartwheel had figured on a stone tomb in Tilney churchyard and local accounts associated these with a man named Hickifric who had withstood the tyranny of the lord of the manor.\n\nIt has been suggested that he echoes the Norse god Thor (Anglo-Saxon: \"Þunor\"): they were both known for fighting giants, ate prodigiously and used a hammer-like weapon (there is even a suggestion that the \"miller\" and Thor's hammer Mjolnir come from the same source).\n\nHe is mentioned in Laurence Sterne's \"Tristram Shandy\" and \"Lavengro\" by George Borrow, although Borrow places his exploits as far north as Lincolnshire. The elaborate moulded plasterwork (pargeting) decorating the Old Sun Inn in Saffron Walden, Essex features his battle against the Wisbech Giant.\n\nA character named Hiccafrith, based on Tom, appears in Marcus Pitcaithly's Hereward trilogy.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VrPQmXOSqA&t=1s", "id": "7703024", "categories": ["Legendary English people", "Fairy tale stock characters", "Cambridgeshire folklore", "Lincolnshire folklore", "Norfolk folklore"], "title": "Tom Hickathrift"}

In 2002, architects created renderings of how the hospital could look; a multi-storey brick building. These drawings were brought to the hospital's Teen Advisory Group (TAG) and changed substantially into a colourful building closely resembling toy building blocks.\n\nThe idea for the Alberta Children's Hospital was to create a building that would reduce stress and promote healing. The interior of the hospital has been designed to enable the delivery of family centred care. The hospital includes supports for families such as sleeping facilities for parents in each patient room, a babysitting service for siblings of patients, a sacred space for spiritual activities, a pet visitation room and the Healing Gardens that surround the new hospital, giving parents and their children areas to heal, to have fun and to spend private time.\n\nThe Alberta Children's Hospital is used by patients from birth to age 18 from southern Alberta, southeastern British Columbia and southwestern Saskatchewan. It is an accredited pediatric level I trauma centre by the Trauma Association of Canada. Additionally, the ACH is the provincial expert and referral centre for bone marrow transplantation, and is the leader in Western Canada (which is rapidly establishing itself as the national leader), for pediatric neurosciences. It also is the only pediatric hospital in Canada that consists of a comprehensive Behavioral Unit, is the world leader in congenital cataracts surgery, and has the largest pediatric vision clinic in all of Western Canada.\n\nThe Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute for Child and Maternal Health (ACHRI) is the Alberta Children's Hospital's affiliated research institute, and has a team of over 150 members dedicated to research and teaching excellence in the study of human development from embryo to adulthood.\n\nThe facility operates 34 clinics:\n\n\n", "id": "7703104", "categories": ["Certified airports in Alberta", "Hospitals established in 1922", "Children's hospitals in Canada", "1922 establishments in Alberta", "Heliports in Canada", "Hospital buildings completed in 1922"], "title": "Alberta Children's Hospital"}

The church was inspired by a sermon preached by Anglican minister|Reverend Dr. W. Herbert Burk, founder and first rector of the parish. The building was designed by architect Milton B. Medary. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 2017, and is undergoing an active restoration campaign.\n\nReverend Burk was rector of an Episcopal church in nearby Norristown. The money for the chapel was raised in small increments (nickels and dimes), and its stone walls were built a \"few feet at a time.\" In the religious and patriotic zeal of the day, Dr. Burk was active in trying to preserve Valley Forge, and in the establishment of the \"Valley Forge Museum of American History\" (the predecessor to the \"Valley Forge Historical Society\").\n\nA previous attempt to build a memorial church at Valley Forge had been launched in 1885 by Baptist minister James M. Guthrie, who raised funds and began building before running out of funds.\n\nOn June 19, 1903, the 125th anniversary of the evacuation of the Continental Army from Valley Forge, the cornerstone was laid on property donated by the I. Heston Todd family. A small wood-framed building nearby preceded the present structure. Following President Theodore Roosevelt's visit to the site and address in 1904, the original wooden building was named the \"\"Theodore Roosevelt Chapel\".\" It was demolished after completion of the present chapel.\n\nThe Chapel's exterior was completed in 1917 and its interior in 1921. It serves as a wayside chapel to those who visit Valley Forge National Historical Park, and is open to the public.\n\nNoted ironsmith Samuel Yellin produced the wrought iron gates, hardware, and locks. He was one of many artisans to produce sculptures, stonework, stained glass and metal work. The interior woodwork was supplied by Belgian-American cabinetmaker Edward Maene (1852–1931).\n\nFrom the visitor's perspective the Chapel, with its central location, can appear to be a part of the park. However, the Chapel and surrounding property belong to the Episcopal Church. Across Valley Forge Park Road (formerly, Port Kennedy Road), standing opposite from the Chapel, is the builder's model of the Washington Monument. This obelisk marks the grave of Lieutenant John Waterman. The original Waterman gravestone had been on display in the visitor's center museum. The Bell Tower houses the DAR Patriot Rolls, listing those that served in the Revolutionary War, and the Chapel grounds hosted the World of Scouting Museum until ca. 2013.\n\nThe \"National Patriots Bell Tower\" was a later addition to the Chapel, and houses its carillon. The tower was built entirely with funds raised by members of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) over a period of more than a decade. Construction began in 1941, but was suspended due to World War II, and restarted in 1949. The bell tower was completed and dedicated in 1953.\n\nThe Justice Bell \"(Women's Liberty Bell)\" is on permanent display in the bell tower chamber. It was forged in 1915 as a nearly identical replica of the Liberty Bell, and became an instrumental symbol of the Women's Suffrage movement. In 1920, after touring many parts of the country to promote the passing of the 19 Amendment, the bell was stored on the grounds of Valley Forge National Park before being permanently moved to the bell tower chamber in 1943.\n\nThe bell tower contains a traditional carillon, with a keyboard of 58 bells. The first 14 bells (from the Meneely Bell Foundry) were installed in a temporary wooden tower in 1926, and the number of bells expanded over the course of three decades. Fifty-six bells were installed in the bell tower in 1953, and expanded to 58 bells in 1963 with two bells from the Fonderie Paccard in France.\n\nThe bell tower is played regularly by a resident carilloneur. Concerts, both formal and informal, are held throughout the year and are open to the public.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7703243", "categories": ["Valley Forge National Historical Park", "Churches in Chester County, Pennsylvania", "Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania", "Monuments and memorials to George Washington in the United States", "Episcopal churches in Pennsylvania", "Monuments and memorials in Pennsylvania", "National Register of Historic Places in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania", "Valley Forge"], "title": "Washington Memorial Chapel"}

State Highway 48 (MN 48) is nearby.\n\nIts name in the Ojibwe language is \"Aazhoomog\", meaning \"Crossroads\" in reference to being at the former crossroad of the north–south trail connecting \"Bikoganaagan\" (Danbury), via the former \"Agaming\" (Outflow/\"Lower Tamarack River Village\"), and the former \"Gibaakwa'iganing\" (Tozer Camp/\"lower Upper Tamarack River Village\") with the east–west trail connecting \"Mooningwanekaaning\" (La Pointe), via \"Namekaawa'iganing\" (Gordon), with \"Gaa-zhiigwanaabikokaag\" (Hinckley).\n\nBefore the arrival of the Dakota Sioux, the area about Lake Lena was inhabited by the Cheyenne, Fox and Ho-Chunk, with migratory Gros Ventre, Mandwe and Menominee peoples. The Lake Lena area served as a place abundant with food, in the heart of the \"Folle Avoine\" Region, with Wild Rice and Sturgeon. In addition, the Lake Lena Village was located along the site of the annual Bear migratory path.\n\nWith the arrival of the Dakota Sioux, only the Fox remained as permanent residents of the region. However, occasional Cheyenne, Ho-Chunk and Menominee peoples still came to the area for the Wild Rice. The Santee Sioux maintained a trade network routes offered by the St. Croix River, and the series of trails connecting the Lake Lena Village with Lake Superior, Mississippi River headwaters and other major upper Mississippi River destinations, Red Cedar River and Chippewa River. With the arrival of the Ojibwe from the cultural center in La Pointe, the area about the upper St. Croix River became a contested place. Though the Fox were permanently pushed out of the area, the Dakota and Ojibwe eventually came to peace and lived side-by-side.\n\nAfter the Ojibwe had gained control of the upper St. Croix River valley, the Lake Lena area became one of many network of trade villages. However, in the 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien, the United States formally drew the boundaries separating the Dakota and the Ojibwe. For the Lake Lena and other \"Manoominikeshiinyag\" Ojibwe, already intertwined with the Dakota, this posed a problem. With agreements, the more southern Dakota north of the \"Prairie du Chien Line\" moved south of the line with the more northern Dakota north of the line were adopted as \"Ojibwe\" and became the Wolf Totem. Meanwhile, many of the Ojibwe located south of the line were adopted into the Mdewakanton. By maintaining the trade network but with a different tribal association, \"Aazhoomog\" transitioned from a Dakota-Ojibwe village to a fully Ojibwe village. The \"Manoominikeshiinyag\" Ojibwe of the upper St. Croix River valley became one of the signatories to the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters and the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe. The 1837 treaty, dubbed the \"White Pine Treaty\", brought an influx of lumber industry. After the Sandy Lake Tragedy, the United States encouraged the consolidation of the Ojibwe onto Indian Reservations rather than removing them west of the Mississippi River. In the treaty negotiations for the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe, St. Croix Chippewa realized that a central reservation would be created immediately south of the Upper St. Croix Lake near Solon Springs, Wisconsin. Due to strong lumber interests, the \"Manoominikeshiinyag\" Ojibwe knew the removal to a reservation would mean eventual loss of hunting, fishing and gathering rights promised the 1837 and 1842 treaties. Upon this realization, the St. Croix Chippewa refuted all provisions of the treaty negotiations and did not sign the 1854 treaty. However, by not signing the treaty, the St. Croix Chippewa lost their federal recognition. However, even as un-recognized Indian Tribe, the St. Croix Chippewa was still eligible to receive their annuities. Depending on the time and location, peoples of St. Croix Chippewa went to either the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation or to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation. Eventually, the Lake Lena Village, through the lumber operations in the region, went to the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation more often than to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation.\n\nAfter the loss of federal recognition of the St. Croix Chippewa, the population of the Aazhoomog slowly declined. For their annuity payment, the people of Aazhoomog were sent to either the Lake Mille Lacs Indian Reservation or the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation. Eventually, the Aazhoomog Village, through the lumber operations in the region, went to the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation more often than to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation. Aazhoomog's English name \"Lake Lena\" came about during this time, named after Mrs. Lena Thayer, who operated a post office until the early 1920s. Beginning in 1922, under the authority of the Consolidated Chippewa Agency, Lake Lena Village began receiving services independent of the Mille Lacs Indians or the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians. In 1936, when Minnesota Chippewa Tribe was created under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the \"Manoominikeshiinyag\" Ojibwe was further divided between those located in Minnesota and those located in Wisconsin.\n\nWhen the contemporary Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe was organized, its charter included the Mille Lacs Indians, Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa, Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa and the St. Croix Band of Chippewa Indians. This was praised in the Lake Lena Village for regaining Federal recognition after 85 years of not having Federal recognition, though it was not independent Federal recognition. However, this posed a major problem for the \"Manoominikeshiinyag\" Ojibwe on the Wisconsin side, especially for those living about Danbury, Wisconsin since the charter also included them, yet they were not eligible to receive services from the Consolidated Chippewa Agency of Minnesota. The remaining St. Croix Chippewa on the Wisconsin side, in order to maintain cohesion of the un-recognized tribe, sought and gained Federal recognition independent of both the Mille Lacs and Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservations, becoming the contemporary St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin.\n\nToday, the Aazhoomog village houses the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District III Government Services and Community Center and the Aazhoomog Clinic of the Ne-Ia-Shing Clinic System. The United States Postal Service places Aazhoomog under Sandstone, Minnesota, though a separate community of \"Asinikaaning\" exists. The Lake Lena Village relies on the nearby Swiss Township fire department for fire emergencies. Near the village, the Mille Lacs Band operates the Crossroads Marathon gas station, convenience store, and laundromat.\n\n", "id": "7703306", "categories": ["Ojibwe", "Anishinaabe communities in the United States", "Unincorporated communities in Pine County, Minnesota"], "title": "Lake Lena, Minnesota"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7703318", "text": "Grisélidis\n\nGrisélidis is an opera (described as a 'conte lyrique') in three acts and a prologue by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Armand Silvestre and Eugène Morand. It is based on the play by the same authors first performed at the Comédie-Française on 15 May 1891, which is drawn from the medieval tale of 'patient Grissil'. The story is set in 14th century Provence, and concerns the shepherdess, Grisélidis, and a number of attempts by the Devil to lure her into infidelity. Grisélidis' loyalty to her husband, The Marquis, is strong, however, and the devil is vanquished.\n\nMassenet began composition in 1894, completing it by the end of that year, but revising it in the autumn 1898 prior to discussing a potential production with Albert Carré. It was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 20 November 1901, with Lucienne Bréval in the title role. The piece achieved 50 performances in the first six months at the Opéra-Comique, was withdrawn from the repertory in 1906, and in a half-century had been seen there 73 times. \n\nAccording to Rodney Milnes, \"Grisélidis\" on its own terms, is one of Massenet’s most successful operas and does not deserve neglect: the action moves swiftly, the instrumentation is economic and delicate, and the melodies unconstrained, with a skilful mixture of comedy and sentiment, and a vocally rewarding title role.\n\nThe opera was staged in Nice, Algiers, Brussels and Milan in 1902; in Marseille in 1903 and 1950, and at the Paris Opéra in 1922. Although not part of the current operatic repertoire, more recently it has been seen in Wexford (1982), Strasbourg and Liège (1986) and Saint-Etienne (1992 in concert).\n\n\"Evening time in the forest\"\nThe shepherd Alain sings of his love for Grisélidis. The Marquis, out hunting, sees her, is overwhelmed and proposes marriage, which she accepts, to the despair of Alain.\n\"Four years later\"\n\nGrisélidis has a son and, as the Marquis departs on a Crusade, his servants promise to confine his wife, which he rejects, having complete trust in her. The devil overhears all this and, as he is unhappily married, explains that he and his wife get pleasure from deceiving husbands. The Marquis accepts the challenge and gives the Devil his ring as a pledge, then taking leave of his wife and son. Bertrade tries to distract Grisélidis by telling her the story of the return of Ulysses.\n\"On a castle terrace six months later, in autumn\"\n\nGrisélidis dreams sadly of her absent husband, while the church bells toll. The Devil and his wife approach Grisélidis disguised as a slave-trader and a Persian houri, showing her the ring to prove that the Marquis has rejected Grisélidis. To tempt Grisélidis, the Devil conjures a magic garden and lures Alain there. The appearance of Loÿs determines Grisélidis not to return to Alain, but his disappearance distracts her, and the Devil takes the child away.\nWhile the castle servants search for Loÿs, the Devil, now disguised as an obsequious old man, tells Grisélidis that a pirate is holding Loÿs, and will only release the child in exchange for a kiss from the Marquise. The Marquis, on returning, meets the old man, who points out Grisélidis running to the shore, but seeing the ring on the Devil’s finger, realizes that he is the victim of deception. The husband and wife are reunited, they pray, and Loÿs is restored to them, to the song of a heavenly chorus.\n\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n", "id": "7703318", "categories": ["Operas", "French-language operas", "Operas by Jules Massenet", "Opera world premieres at the Opéra-Comique", "1901 operas"], "title": "Grisélidis"}

This was the very day on which his great forebear Dame Nellie Melba died. His maternal cousin was the tenor Ken Neate. He studied singing with Jessye Schmidt and Browning Mummery before leaving for further studies in London with Dino Borgioli, Joan Cross, Herman Simberg, Audrey Langford, Andrew Field and Glyndebourne's Jani Strasser. During this time he also worked as a rehearsal singer with Sir Thomas Beecham for two years before his friend Richard Bonynge assisted enormously in developing a tenor voice from his former bass-baritone. After a further two years with Bonynge, Weaving was engaged by the Sadler's Wells Opera and made his debut as Danilo in \"The Merry Widow\" opposite June Bronhill at the London Coliseum, the first of many hundreds of performances of the role.\n\nAt Sadler's Wells Weaving also sang Lensky in \"Eugene Onegin\", Alfredo in \"La traviata\", and \"Roméo et Juliette\" opposite Elsie Morison, as well as other operetta appearances including Pluto in \"Orpheus in the Underworld\", Raoul de Gardefeu in \"La Vie parisienne\" and Danilo, all of which were recorded by HMV at Abbey Road studios. In this time he made various recordings with the BBC, the first of which was as Eisenstein in \"Die Fledermaus\" direct from a stage performance at the Wells. He also sang again with June Bronhill when he appeared as Sir Walter Raleigh in \"Merrie England\". In 1962, Jon began a tour of Australia and New Zealand for Sadler's Wells, which had become the English National Opera Company. During this time he starred in a weekly television series with Suzanne Steele, which ran on the ABC for three years. He sang with the All-State Symphony Orchestra during this period and on his third tour of New Zealand, directed and sang Frederick in \"The Pirates of Penzance\" at Her Majesty's Theatre in Auckland.\n\nReturning to Europe in 1966 he was engaged by Benjamin Britten after many Covent Garden auditions for the role of MacHeath in Britten's adaptation of \"The Beggar's Opera\" and sang this role under the baton of Norman Del Mar in London, France and in Montreal at the World Expo in 1967. After study with Modesti in Paris he was engaged for his first Wagnerian role, Lohengrin, which he sang first at the Kiel Opera House in 1967. In Kiel, he went on to sing Herman in Tchaikovsky's \"The Queen of Spades\", Otello, Andrier Chenier, Hoffman, Canio, Gounod's \"Faust\", Don Jose, Florestan, MacDuff in \"Macbeth\" etc., as well as singing classical operetta roles such as Sou Chong in \"The Land of Smiles\", Danilo in \"The Merry Widow\", The Count of Luxembourg and The Gypsy Baron. He also created roles in four world premieres during this time and later Rashomon for the Olympic Games in Munich. He was constantly offered Wagnerian roles and finally agreed to sing Siegmund under the baton of Hans Zender and Klaus Tennstedt. This was a success and was followed by Loge in \"Das Rheingold\" and Erik in \"The Flying Dutchman\". During this time in Kiel he guested all over Europe and returned to London for performances of Pluto in \"Orpheus in the Underworld\" and Bacchus in \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" under Sir Charles Mackerras. He made numerous television appearances during this time also e.g. \"The Phil Silvers Show\", where he sang arias and appeared in a duet with his former idol, Sergeant Bilko. He made his debut at the Bavarian State Opera, Munich as Dimitri in \"Boris Godunov\" under Rafael Kubelík and then returned to Australia for concerts and a recording of Malcolm Williamson's \"The Violins of Saint-Jacques\" with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, which was also released on video. Returning to Europe he finally decided to accept offers to sing both Siegfrieds and sang his first Ring in London under the batons of Sir Charles Mackerras and Sir Reginald Goodall. His first German Ring was in Wiesbaden and he was offered numerous contracts to sing the two roles in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and France. He continued every year to sing the Siegfrieds and Siegmund in the famous English Ring in London and went on to create the Siegfrieds in the Herz Ring in Wagner's birthplace, Leipzig. He sang in this famous production for several seasons before deciding to take his family back to Australia, where he was to sing a recital tour with Geoffrey Parsons, record two albums and sing numerous concerts for the ABC throughout Australia. He sang Siegmund and Siegfried for the Australian Opera, again under Sir Charles Mackerras and performed \"Die Walküre\" with both Hiroyuki Iwaki and Leif Segerstam. With his wife, the Swedish soprano Monique Brynnel, he made a television series and appeared in numerous concerts and sang with her in seasons with the Victorian and Queensland Opera companies. He lived in Kew in Melbourne and made a career teaching singing privately, having numerous successful students enter the opera world. He had two sons; Jon (b. 1955 to first wife soprano Margaret Nisbett) and Jack (b. 1974).\n\nJon was offered numerous film roles, the highlight of which was to be invited to Rome by Federico Fellini to screen test for the lead in \"Fellini's Casanova\". This he declined in order to continue his operatic career. He had many very successful singing students.\n\nIn May 2011, Jon Weaving and Monique Brynnel emigrated from Australia to Sweden. They established a singing school in their new home town.

The seventeenth tropical cyclone, thirteenth named storm, and eighth hurricane of the season, Michael developed from a non-tropical system to the southwest of Bermuda on October 15. The system was initially subtropical, but rapidly acquired tropical characteristics by October 17. Michael quickly strengthened into a hurricane later that day. By October 20, Michael peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale at a relatively high latitude of 44°N. The storm weakened slightly to a Category 1 hurricane and became extratropical shortly before making landfall in Newfoundland on October 20.\n\nAs the intensity of Michael was equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane during landfall, high winds were reported throughout Atlantic Canada, especially in Newfoundland. Winds from the storm peaked at in St. Lawrence, Newfoundland; other locations across the island reported winds of . High winds caused minor structure damage across Newfoundland, confined to vinyl siding peeled off, shattered windows, and unroofed houses. In addition, sporadic power outages were also reported from Corner Brook to St. John's. Michael also dropped rainfall across Atlantic Canada and in Maine. The rainfall was generally light, with much of the region reporting between of precipitation. Michael also produced high tides, accompanied by waves reported as high as by a buoy well offshore of Newfoundland.\n\nThe system originated out of a non-tropical cold-core upper level low that drifted southward into the subtropics. The low interacted with a cold front, which resulted in the development of a stationary front over the Bahamas on October 10. As the cold low drifted southward, a surface low developed on October 12. The surface low remained mostly stationary until early on October 15 as it merged with the upper-level low and deepened while north of the Bahamas and east of the coast of Florida. Later that day, the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as a subtropical depression. The storm remained stationary over warm water, with sea surface temperatures around , while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics. Around 0000 UTC on October 16, it strengthened into a subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed a stronger storm. Later that day, the cyclone continued to develop as more thunderstorms formed and persisted near the low-level circulation.\nBy 0000 UTC on October 17, the transition was completed and Michael was reclassified as a tropical storm as supported by satellite classifications via the Dvorak technique. Shortly thereafter, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Seventeen; post-analysis later discovered it was actually a tropical storm. A well-defined eye quickly developed early on October 17 as Michael began to strengthen and continued to organize. That afternoon, Michael rapidly intensified further and was upgraded to a hurricane as Reconnaissance flights found winds of . At that point, Michael began to move northward. While Michael was maintaining minimal hurricane status, the eye remained ragged, yet well-defined. Early on October 19, Michael briefly strengthened to 140 km/h (85 mph) before weakening slightly six hours later. Tracking into cooler water, Michael began its extratropical transition while accelerating to the northeast towards Newfoundland, which prevented significant weakening. The acceleration was caused by a shortwave trough embedded within strong southwesterly mid-level flow.\n\nUnexpectedly, Michael began to rapidly intensify on October 19 while in extratropical transition. Later that day, a ship report in the eastern eyewall reported a minimum central pressure of and maximum sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), making Michael a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. The sudden intensification was determined to have been as a result of baroclinic effects as it interacted with an incoming trough, which provided additional energy to counter the general weakening of hurricanes while in the high latitudes over sea-surface temperatures around . At 2300 UTC on October 19, shortly after completing its transition to an extratropical cyclone, Michael made landfall near Parsons Harbour, Newfoundland with winds of 155 km/h (100 mph). The extratropical system gradually weakened as it tracked across Newfoundland on October 20, and slowed down considerably with the presence of the trough. The storm was absorbed by another extratropical low just north of Newfoundland that afternoon.\n\nBecause it was unknown that Michael became extratropical before landfall, it was initially considered the first tropical cyclone to strike Newfoundland since Hurricane Luis in 1995. Furthermore, Michael was also considered the first hurricane to make landfall in Canada since Hurricane Hortense in 1996. When the Meteorological Service of Canada and the National Research Council flew a Convair research flight into Michael on October 19, it was the first successful research flight made into a tropical cyclone by those agencies. Subsequent flights have been made into Tropical Storm Karen, Hurricane Isabel (while inland), Hurricane Juan, and Hurricane Ophelia.\n\nIn advance of the storm, the Newfoundland Weather Centre posted wind warnings, gale warnings, storm warnings, and hurricane warnings throughout Newfoundland. Rainfall advisories were also issued in portions of the East Coast, Central Newfoundland, the South Coast, and the West Coast. Offshore, storm force wind warnings were declared on October 19 for Newfoundland waters. Several Special Weather Statements were also posted.\n\nLight to moderate damage was reported throughout Newfoundland, primarily as a result of the strong winds. The entire region was affected by Michael, though the majority of the damage was confined to small communities east of where the storm made landfall, including Gaultois, Harbour Breton, Hermitage and English Harbour West. These areas reported significant power outages and minor structural damage; vinyl siding was peeled off, windows were shattered, and roof shingles were torn off in some localized locations. The most severe damage was in Gaultois, where several roofs were torn off and trees were uprooted. Wind damage also occurred in the St. John's Metropolitan Area, where a Sobeys store in Conception Bay South had broken windows. Sporadic power outages were reported throughout the island, as far east as St. John's, and as far west as Corner Brook. As the storm struck at low tide, storm surge was insignificant. However, just prior to landfall, waves on the coast of Newfoundland reached heights of . Rainfall near the storm's track was generally around , though further inland, precipitation reached . Rainfall from the hurricane amounted to at Englee, a small fishing community on the Great Northern Peninsula. Wind gusts peaked at at St. Lawrence, with other reports varying between and . Despite severe winds, damage was relatively light due to high construction standards in Newfoundland, where winter storms routinely result in hurricane-force winds, as well as the sparse population of the area affected.\n\nThe tug \"Atlantic Elm\" lost its tow to the unmanned barge \"Portland Star\" on October 19. The barge was carrying over 18,000 tonnes of cement and diesel fuel and was later reported to have sunk in the Fortune Bay. Damage was reported to numerous pleasure craft around the bay due to the waves; two sailboats were toppled. Also, ferry service between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia was disrupted. Several offshore buoys and ships reported high winds and low barometric pressure, as well as waves of up to 16.9 m (55 ft).\n\nOn October 14 and October 15, the frontal boundary associated with the hurricane's precursor dropped heavy rainfall on Bermuda, amounting to . However, as a tropical cyclone, Michael remained far from the island. Impact outside Newfoundland was generally light. However, rainfall was greater in some areas of Nova Scotia than in Newfoundland, where precipitation reached over North Mountain. Light rain was also reported in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec. Effects from the storm in the United States were minimal, limited to light rainfall in the state of Maine which totaled less than .\n\n\n", "id": "7703414", "categories": ["Category 2 Atlantic hurricanes", "Hurricanes in Canada", "2000 Atlantic hurricane season"], "title": "Hurricane Michael (2000)"}

A statement terminator is used to demarcate the end of an individual statement. Languages that interpret the end of line to be the end of a statement are called \"line-oriented\" languages.\n\n\"Line continuation\" is a convention in line-oriented languages where the newline character could potentially be misinterpreted as a statement terminator. In such languages, it allows a single statement to span more than just one line.\n\nLine continuation is generally done as part of lexical analysis: a newline normally results in a token being added to the token stream, unless line continuation is detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo import a library is a way to read external, possibly compiled, routines, programs or packages. Imports can be classified by level (module, package, class, procedure...) and by syntax (directive name, attributes...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above statements can also be classified by whether they are a syntactic convenience (allowing things to be referred to by a shorter name, but they can still be referred to by some fully qualified name without import), or whether they are actually required to access the code (without which it is impossible to access the code, even with fully qualified names).\n\n\n\nA block is a notation for a group of two or more statements, expressions or other units of code that are related in such a way as to comprise a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\nComments can be classified by:\n\nInline comments are generally those that use a newline character to indicate the end of a comment, and an arbitrary delimiter or sequence of tokens to indicate the beginning of a comment.\n\nExamples:\n\nBlock comments are generally those that use a delimiter to indicate the beginning of a comment, and another delimiter to indicate the end of a comment.

He succeeded his father in the barony of Arkadia (modern Kyparissia) in 1402. Though young, he was ambitious and he overthrew his aunt, Maria II Zaccaria, in Achaea in 1404; a move which was approved by his overlord, the king of Naples. Immediately, he reinforced his power on a local basis by marrying Creusa, the daughter of Leonardo II Tocco, lord of Zante and niece of Carlo I Tocco whose dominions covered Cephalonia and Lefkada and extended to Epirus and the western Peloponnese. Centurione then made his brother Stephen the Latin Archbishop of Patras. \n\nHowever, Centurione was quickly at war with his alienated relatives. His wife's cousin Carlo I Tocco, duke of Leucas, had Ladislaus absolve him from his feudal obligations to Achaea (1406) and then, allied with Theodore I Palaiologos, Despot of Morea, made war on the principality, conquering Glarentza (1408), long the principality's chief seaport. His brother Stephen, however, abandoned the diocese of Patras to the Venetians on loan for five years. Centurione himself was forced to ally with the Venetians and Justinian, Lord of Chios, and to hire Albanian mercenaries to retake the port on 12 July 1414. In return for military protection, he granted the ports of Glarentza and Navarino to the Giustiniani family of Genoa. \n\nThereafter, for three years, Centurione could obtain no help from Genoa, pressed by the Duke of Milan on land and by the Crown of Aragon at sea. In 1417, the imperial army of Constantinople, led by the despot Theodore II Palaeologus and Emperor John VIII, invaded Achaea. They took Messenia and Elis and holed up Centurione in Glarentza, from which he fled by sea in the spring of 1418. A little later, Patras too fell. Only by the mediation of the Venetians occupying Navarino was the prince able to secure a truce. \n\nAll that was left of the principality that once dominated Greece were a few fortresses, such as the ancestral castle and barony of Chalandritsa. In 1429, Thomas Palaeologus of the Morea besieged Centurione in Chalandritsa and extracted a treaty from him whereby his daughter, Catherine, would marry the despot and thus make him Centurione's heir in Achaea. Centurione was allowed to keep his inheritance, the barony of Arcadia (not to be confused with the region of the same name). Centurione retired to Arcadia in 1430, after the marriage was finalised. He died there two years later. His domains passed to the despotate of Morea and into Byzantine hands.\n\nCenturione left one illegitimate son, John Asen Zaccaria, who was the centre of later revolts against Greek authority.\n\n", "id": "7703487", "categories": ["Princes of Achaea", "1432 deaths", "14th-century births", "Asen dynasty", "Barons of the Principality of Achaea", "Zaccaria family"], "title": "Centurione II Zaccaria"}

He was the son of gynecologist Johann Baptist Chiari (1817–1854), and brother to rhinolaryngologist Ottokar Chiari (1853–1918).\n\nChiari studied medicine in Vienna, where he was an assistant to Karl Freiherr von Rokitansky (1804–1878) and Richard Ladislaus Heschl (1824–1881). In 1878 he received his habilitation in pathological anatomy, and within a few years became an associate professor at the University of Prague. At Prague he was also superintendent of the pathological-anatomical museum. In 1906 he relocated to the University of Strasbourg as a professor of pathological anatomy.\n\nChiari's research dealt largely with postmortem examinations, and most of his numerous writings are the result of autopsies. In the 1890s he described a condition involving deformities of the cerebellum, and brainstem in children with herniation of the spinal cord. The phenomenon was later to become known as the \"Arnold-Chiari malformation\", named after Chiari and German pathologist, Julius Arnold (1835–1915). The malformation was given its name in 1907 by two of Dr. Arnold's students.\n\nAnother medical term named after Chiari is the Budd-Chiari syndrome, which is ascites and cirrhosis of the liver caused by an obstruction of the hepatic veins due to a blood clot. It is named in conjunction with British physician George Budd (1808–1882). Lastly, Chiari is also famous for describing the \"Chiari network\", an embryonic remnant found in the right atrium, first published in 1897.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7703488", "categories": ["Austrian pathologists", "1851 births", "People from Vienna", "1916 deaths"], "title": "Hans Chiari"}

In the United States, Canada and Australia, it is the ninth episode but it's the tenth overall and was written by Oliver Goldstick and directed by Ken Whittingham. This episodes's title is a pun on a former ABC sitcom, \"Who's the Boss?\", which starred Judith Light, who became a regular on this series.\n\nIt's the day after Thanksgiving. A hungover Daniel finds himself waking up in his black socks and boxers in Betty's bed. She reminds him that she picked him up drunk in a bar last night. When he asks her where she slept, her answer was 'In your arms,' but she's just teasing; she actually slept on the couch. He bitterly tells her that Sofia ran away with her perfect boyfriend and 'his perfect chin' (aka Hunter, her fiancé). She tries to reassure him that a lot can change in a short time and tucks him back into bed. Betty goes downstairs and tells her father to be nice to Daniel when he wakes up. Another surprise guest, Santos, walks into the kitchen in a kimono and Ignacio says he liked it better when he sneaked out in the middle of the night. Daniel eventually comes down and tries to leave quietly, but Ignacio finds him and pulls him into the kitchen. Santos begins to compliment Daniel on his publicized history with the ladies before Ignacio brings Daniel a plate of food that sends him running to the bathroom.\n\nMeanwhile, back at \"MODE\", Wilhelmina is going through the litany of destructions that befell her office to Marc. He tried to pretend that he was in Schenectady on Thanksgiving, but she knows that it was him after she discovered the 15 grams of fat left behind in the form of a cashew Amanda dropped. However that issue would be put aside when Bradford calls to tell Wilhelmina to turn on \"Fashion TV\" where they see Isaac Mizrahi reporting on an elusive sought-after couple. Bradford then tells her that they've been chosen to reveal 'baby Chutney' (the newborn of celebrity couple Tim and Chloe) to the world for the first time.\n\nBetty walks into the office and finds Sofia leaving a note for Daniel; he hasn't been calling her back. She begins to go on about her marriage plans with Hunter before confessing to Betty that she isn't sure anymore, but would Daniel even care? Betty tries to feign disinterest and they return to work.\n\nBradford comes down looking for Daniel, worried about the photo shoot for Tim and Chloe's baby. Sofia has offered to do the writing. Betty calls Daniel, still mildly drunk and mollycoddled on the sofa by Justin and Ignacio. He tells Betty that he is not going anywhere and he's having a Christmas tree delivered to her family. Betty begins to wonder how she will get this shoot taken care of. While Justin starts to tell Daniel about issues of \"MODE\" he's saved, Ignacio slips away to ask Hilda how long she thinks Santos will stay this time, now that Hilda and Santos had their night of lovemaking.\n\nBack at \"MODE\", Bruno the stylist arrives with Amanda. He tries to fob Betty off while she makes excuses for Daniel. He demands coffee and starts explaining his concept to Amanda. Meanwhile, Wilhelmina and Marc are driving around town worrying about the shoot. Marc sends Amanda a message that Wilhelmina knows all about their secret romp; Amanda scarfs down a croissant. Amanda then sends Marc a text message back which obviously outs him as the culprit even though Wilhelmina is unaware it was Amanda who answered the phone (she took Marc's phone from him after seeing the text, then threw it out the window). He begins to wheeze while Wilhelmina demands to know why he was calling the hospital. But just as she was about give Marc the grilling the car gets a flat while Marc hyperventilates.\n\nBetty continues trying to call Daniel while Sofia tries to get information out of Betty about him. Bruno starts to go through a series of baby outfits before deciding on a chain mail outfit. Betty questions the choice, but he says he won't take critiques from someone who trims her bangs with a lighter. Meanwhile, Daniel goes through the homemade ornaments of Betty's family while they decorate the tree. They ask him to hang an ornament but he isn't sure how; he was never allowed to touch the Christmas tree growing up.\n\nLater on in the day, Christina tries to sort out a costume for the baby while Betty calls Daniel again. He's enjoying decorating her tree; it was just a photo opportunity in his family. He tells her that she should look after things; she always wants more responsibility. The designer then goes into a panic. He just received a photo of the baby and it's hideous. Betty says that maybe he's not the right person for the job if he doesn't think he can find something beautiful in a baby. He tells her she should find someone who designs installations for the zoo and storms out. On the way out, he asks Sofia who she was. Sofia answers 'Today, she's the boss'. Sofia offers to help Betty, but Betty explains that Daniel's heart is broken and he's drunk himself sick. Amanda then walks in and announces that 'team Baby Chutney has arrived and is waiting.'\n\nAcross town, Wilhelmina and Marc decide to go grab a cab. As they do, Marc tries to make excuses for his behavior by pretending that he didn't know anything about who was on the phone, but she tells him that he stepped way over the line; she doesn't know that she can protect him anymore. The person he tried to call (the mystery woman) is not amused. The driver pulls over and throws them out after Wilhelmina begins insulting him for getting lost (After all, she did say \"Take the side streets\"). She left her bag in the back of the cab and now they're stranded. They walk the streets and ask some prostitutes for cash. The prostitutes start feeling up Wilhelmina's fur and she tries to talk slang to them but fails abysmally. Marc pretends to be her pimp (he calls Wilhelmina \"Lil' Kim\") and ushers her off before the girls can go for their knives. They later end up in a church, where Wilhelmina complains how she can't do her job anymore because she has to look after Daniel all the time but then lets slip her plot to take over Meade Publications, thus giving Marc an idea to guarantee his future. They rob the poor box for cab fare but Wilhelmina leaves a diamond earring in return.\n\nAt the Suarez house, Santos tries to get Justin to come out and play football, to get away from the glamour, to be a 'normal kid', only to see this picture perfect family moment come apart when Hilda and Santos begin arguing. She's comfortable with who Justin is and so is Justin. She says that Santos has no business telling her how to raise their son, after having walked out on them three years earlier. Upset, Santos says 'adios' and walks out. Daniel stays with Justin making ornaments as they decorate the tree. He apologizes to Ignacio for stepping in all day, yet Ignacio thanks him, telling him that he'll make a good father.\n\nLater on at \"MODE\", Betty tries to create a concept; she's going to portray Tim and Chloe as a 21st Century Adam and Eve in a jungle setting. She calls Daniel with her idea, but he says that she should bring Tim and Chloe to her house for the shoot. Betty goes to the elevator and Sofia is there. Betty asks her for a ride back to her house. They arrive at the Suarezes' and Betty tells Sofia that she needs to tell Daniel that the next time Sofia sees him, she'll be someone's wife.\n\nAfter escaping a harrowing experience known as the seedy part of Queens, Wilhelmina and Marc return to the office and she's outraged the shoot has been moved to Queens. She gets a call from her mysterious friend, saying that she's an old friend from college. Realizing an opportunity after finding out that Wilhelmina never went to college, Marc says that they don't have any secrets anymore; he wants job security and a company credit card in exchange for keeping her secret. Marc also told Amanda that she was off the hook, but \"...it would cost her.\"\n\nInside Betty's house, everything is prepared as Ignacio and Daniel look out the window. Daniel asks him how to say 'I love you and can't live without you' in Spanish. Ignacio tells him, then wishes him luck. Outside, Sofia tells Betty that she's wasting her life at \"MODE\": She should come and work for her. Betty doesn't know what to say. She goes inside and tells Daniel he should talk to Sofia before she leaves. In the snow, he tells her that he comes from a very messed up family and asks for one more chance before he bungles a Spanish declaration of love, although he messes up and says 'I love my camera' instead. He gives her an ornament he made and asks her to pick out a tree with him. They kiss.\n\nBack inside, Daniel tells Betty that he convinced Sofia to stay and tells her to take the job she offered; he doesn't want to get in her way, she deserves more. She hugs him. After he leaves, the family talks about how exciting it all was and how Betty just got another job offer. But the celebration takes a serious turn for the worse for the Suarezes when the doorbell rings and two immigration officers come to inform Ignacio that he is under arrest while the family is celebrating in the living room.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Michaeal Sleazak gave the episode a great review by noting, \"Speaking of holiday treats, I don't even know where to start with this episode, arguably the funniest in Betty's short, punch-line-filled run.

His students include Viatcheslav Kharlamov, Yakov Eliashberg, Mikhail Gromov, Nikolai V. Ivanov, Anatoly Vershik and Oleg Viro.\n\nRokhlin's contributions to topology include Rokhlin's theorem, a result of 1952 on the signature of 4-manifolds, which was subsequently generalised by Friedrich Hirzebruch. He also worked in the theory of characteristic classes, homotopy theory and cobordism theory.\n\nIn measure theory, Rokhlin introduced what are now called Rokhlin partitions. He introduced the notion of standard probability space, and characterised such spaces up to isomorphism mod 0. He also proved the famous Rokhlin lemma.\n\nHis son Vladimir Rokhlin, Jr. is a well-known mathematician and computer scientist at Yale University.\n\nRokhlin's uncle was Korney Chukovsky, a well-known Russian poet, most famous for his popular children's books.\n\n\n", "id": "7703611", "categories": ["Jewish scientists", "Azerbaijani Jews", "Moscow State University alumni", "Russian Jews", "Topologists", "Soviet mathematicians", "1984 deaths", "Algebraic geometers", "Russian mathematicians", "20th-century mathematicians", "People from Baku", "1919 births", "Soviet prisoners of war", "Nazi concentration camp survivors"], "title": "Vladimir Abramovich Rokhlin"}

She was launched on 9 August 1938 and commissioned on 24 October with \"Kapitänleutnant\" Heinrich Liebe in command.\n\n\"U-38\" conducted eleven patrols, as part of several flotillas. During her career, she sank over 30 enemy vessels and damaged a further one. \"U-38\" ranks as one of the most successful U-boats in World War II. She was scuttled west of Wesermünde (modern Bremerhaven) on 5 May 1945. Throughout the war, the U-Boat suffered no losses among her crew.\n\nAs one of the eight original German Type IX submarines, later designated IXA, \"U-38\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .\n\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"U-38\" was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.\n\n\"U-38\" left the port of Wilhelmshaven on 19 August 1939. The boat operated off the coast of Lisbon, returning to port on 18 September. During this four-week period, she sank two ships.\n\nOn 5 September 1939 \"U-38\" stopped the French ship \"Pluvoise\", examined her papers and released her. \"Pluvoise\" broadcast the event, warning others of the U-boat. For this, Liebe was reprimanded. The already strict rules restricting submarine warfare were further tightened to prevent a recurrence of the event and all U-boats were instructed to avoid contact with any French merchant vessels.\n\nThe British steam freighter SS \"Manaar\" was sunk on 6 September 1939. \"U-38\" opened fire on the freighter, intending to stop her, but she returned fire. This was the first time that a merchantman fired at a U-boat. Stunned by this unexpected response, \"U-38\" dived and sank \"Manaar\" with torpedoes. Citing the fact that \"Manaar\" had fired at him, Liebe did not assist the survivors, reasoning that the vessel was exempted from protection by the Submarine Protocol. Berlin would release to the media the narrative that the \"Manaar\" had fired on \"U-38\" on sight. While Karl Dönitz did not believe that his submarines should have to maintain adherence to the Submarine Protocol in the face of armed merchantmen, due to the political situation, restrictions remained in force after this incident and he was merely able to issue instruction to all submarines to exercise caution. Radio Officer James Turner remained at his post until the last moment. As he was leaving he found two Lascars, one badly injured. Turner rescued both men while under continuous fire from \"U-38\", for this he was awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal.\n\nOn 11 September 1939, while flying the Irish tricolour, \"Inverliffey\" was shelled and sunk. In spite of Captain William Trowsdale's protestation that they were Irish, Liebe said that they \"were sorry\" but they would sink \"Inverliffey\" as she was carrying contraband petrol to England. The crew took to the lifeboats. \"Inverliffey\" burned fiercely, endangering the lifeboats. At risk to herself, the German submarine approached, threw lines to the lifeboats and towed them to safety. As Captain Trowsdale's lifeboat was damaged, the occupants were allowed to board the U-boat. The captain did not have a lifebelt, so he was given one. \"U-38\" stopped the American tanker \"R.G. Stewart\" and put \"Inverliffey\"s crew on board. Just two days earlier, Inver tankers transferred its ships from the Irish to the British registry.\n\nAfter nearly two months in port, \"U-38\" left Wilhelmshaven, again with Heinrich Liebe in command, on 12 November 1939. This second patrol was to see the boat operate in the waters northwest of Norway.\n\nOn 17 November 1939, Naval High Command (SKL) issued orders for \"U-38\" and to scout the location for \"Basis Nord\", a secret German naval base to be used for raids on allied shipping which was located off the Kola Peninsula and provided by the Soviet Union. The mission required coded messages to be flashed to Soviet naval vessels patrolling the area preceding a Soviet escort to the prospective base location.\n\n\"U-36\" never left the Norwegian Sea and was sunk by the British submarine . \"U-38\" rounded the North Cape uneventfully and arrived in Teriberka Bay by mid-afternoon on 26 November. Running silently into the bay, \"U-38\" had to avoid being spotted by merchant vessels in order to help maintain the Soviet Union's attempted appearance of neutrality at that time. \"U-38\"s captain commented that, while in the area of the North Cape and the Kola Peninsula, he had observed thirty to forty targets and regrettably had been \"harmless to [all] of them.\"\n\nAfter completing the clandestine reconnaissance mission, \"U-38\" returned to raiding duties and sank three ships, two British and one Greek. The British steam freighter SS \"Thomas Walton\" was sunk on 7 December. The Greek steam freighter SS \"Garoufalia\" was destroyed on 11 December, as was the British steam freighter on 13 December. After an operational period of four and a half weeks, \"U-38\" returned to Wilhelmshaven on 16 December.\n\nOnce again, \"U-38\" would spend considerable time in port, prior to sailing on 26 February 1940, for operations in the Western Approaches.\n\n\"U-38\" sank six ships. First sent to the bottom was the neutral Irish steam trawler on 9 March, with a single shell at point-blank range off Tory Island, all 11 crew were lost. The \"Leukos\" was fishing in the company of British trawlers; it has been speculated that she positioned herself between the surfacing U-boat and the fleeing British in the belief that her neutral markings would protect her. This event was followed by the sinking of the Danish motor freighters SS \"Argentina\" on 17 March and SS \"Algier\" and SS \"Christiansborg\" on 21 March. The Norwegian motor freighter MV \"Cometa\" was sunk on 26 March. The sixth and final ship sunk during this third patrol was the Finnish steam freighter SS \"Signe\" on 2 April. After nearly six weeks on the high seas, \"U-38\" returned to Wilhelmshaven on 5 April 1940.\n\n\"U-38\" left her home port of Wilhelmshaven with Heinrich Liebe in command on 8 April 1940. She would sweep the waters off Norway, supporting the occupation of that country by Nazi troops. During this patrol, \"U-38\" reported problems with her torpedoes, after was fired upon with no result. \"U-38\" would return to port on 27 April.\n\nThere were two naval battles of Narvik on 10 and 13 April 1940. \"U-38\" and \"U-65\" were positioned at the entrance to the fjord. When the Royal Navy arrived, \"U-38\" fired at and at missing both. In the second battle, \"U-38\" fired at \"Effingham\", but the torpedoes malfunctioned, (exploding prematurely).\n\nFor her fifth patrol, \"U-38\" would again depart from Wilhelmshaven with Heinrich Liebe in command on 6 June 1940. She was to patrol the waters off southern Ireland. During this operation, Liebe would hit six ships, two of which were sailing in convoy at the time. On 14 June, \"U-38\" sank the Greek steam freighter SS \"Mount Myrto\". The next day, \"U-38\" sank two ships, both sailing as part of Convoy HX 47, sailing from Halifax to England. First sunk was the Canadian steam freighter SS \"Erik Boye\", followed by the Norwegian motor tanker MV \"Italia\". Five days later, on 20 June, the Swedish steam freighter SS \"Tilia Gorthon\" was torpedoed and sunk. The Belgian steam freighter SS \"Luxembourg\" was destroyed on 21 June, followed by the Greek steam freighter SS \"Neion\" the following day. After three weeks at sea, \"U-38\" returned to Wilhelmshaven on 2 July.\n\nDuring this patrol, \"U-38\" was able to land Walter Simon, a Nazi agent, at Dingle Bay in Ireland on 12 June. Not realising that the passenger services of the Tralee and Dingle Light Railway had been closed fourteen months earlier, he asked when the next train to Dublin was. He was arrested and interned in the Curragh Camp for the duration of the war.\n\n\"U-38\" would depart Wilhelmshaven for the last time on 1 August 1940, again with Heinrich Liebe in command. On this month-long patrol off the western coast of Ireland, \"U-38\" would hit and sink three ships, all of which were in convoy at the time of attack. On 7 August the Egyptian liner was sunk while traveling with HX 61, from Halifax to Gibraltar, 320 died. The British steam freighter SS \"Llanfair\" was hit and sunk, travelling as part of SL-41 from Sierra Leone to England. The third and final ship hit on the sixth patrol of \"U-38\" was the British steam freighter SS \"Har Zion\", while travelling with the Convoy OB 225, from Liverpool to the United States. After four weeks at sea Liebe returned \"U-38\" to her new home port of Lorient in France on 3 September 1940.\n\nFor her first patrol from Lorient and her seventh overall, \"U-38\" would again be under the command of Heinrich Liebe. She departed on 25 September, for the Northwest Approaches. She would attack five ships on this patrol, sinking four of them. On 1 October, the British motor freighter MV \"Highland Patriot\" was torpedoed. After two weeks of no victories, \"U-38\" was successful against the Greek steam freighter SS \"Aenos\" on 17 October, sailing as part of Convoy SC 7, from Sydney, Nova Scotia to England. The following day, the British steam freighter SS \"Carsbreck\" was damaged, but not sunk, while traveling with the SC 7 convoy from Sydney to Grimsby, England. On 19 October, two ships were hit, both sailing as part of the HX 79 convoy: the Dutch SS \"Bilderdijk\" and the British steam freighter SS \"Matheran\". Following these victories, \"U-38\" returned to Lorient on 24 October 1940.\n\n\"U-38\" would depart Lorient with Liebe in command once again on 18 December 1940. The eighth war patrol of her career would involve operations again in the Northwest Approaches. During this patrol, the submarine would hit and sink two ships. On 27 December, \"U-38\" destroyed the British ship SS \"Waiotira\", and on 31 December, she sank the Swedish motor freighter SS \"Valparaiso\", sailing as part of the HX 97 convoy from Halifax to Glasgow. \"U-38\" returned to port on 22 January 1941.\n\n\"U-38\" would spend two and a half months in port, before leaving for operations off the west coast of Africa on 9 April 1941. This would prove to be her most successful patrol, with the sinking of eight ships. On 4 May, the Swedish steam freighter SS \"Japan\" was torpedoed while traveling with Convoy OB 310 from England to the United States. The following day, the British motor freighter MV \"Queen Maud\" was hit and sunk. On 23 May, the Dutch motor freighter SS \"Berhala\" was sunk while traveling with the Convoy OB 318, from England to America. The British steam freighter SS \"Vulcain\" was torpedoed and sunk on 24 May. Six days later, on 29 May, the British steam freighter SS \"Tabaristan\" was another victim. The following day the destruction continued, the British steam freighter SS \"Empire Protector\" was sent to the bottom, as was the Norwegian steam freighter SS \"Rinda\" on the 31st. The eighth and final ship sunk during \"U-38\" ninth patrol was the British cargo steamship on 8 June. The boat then returned to Lorient on 29 June 1941, after spending eleven and a half weeks at sea.\n\nFor the first time in her career, \"U-38\" would head to sea with a new commander, \"Korvettenkapitän\" Heinrich Schuch. She left on 6 August, for a five-week patrol in the North Atlantic. During this time one ship was hit, the Panamanian steam freighter SS \"Longtanker\" on 18 August. \"U-38\" returned to Lorient on 14 September 1941.\n\n\"U-38\" would depart from Lorient for the last time on 15 October, again with Heinrich Schuch in command. Her eleventh patrol was to take place in the North Atlantic. However, during a period of five weeks, not a single ship was hit. \"U-38\" traveled to the U-boat base in Bergen, Norway on 21 November. She would later depart Bergen on the 23rd and arrive in Stettin on 29 November.\n\nFrom December 1941 until November 1943, \"U-38\" was used as a training boat in the \"24th\" and \"21st U-boat Flotillas\". She was then used as a testing boat, until she was scuttled by her crew on 5 May 1945.\n\n\"U-38\" took part in five wolfpacks, namely.\n\nDuring her service in the \"Kriegsmarine\", \"U-38\" sank 35 commercial ships for , and damaged another of .\n\n", "id": "7703762", "categories": ["1938 ships", "World War II submarines of Germany", "Ships built in Bremen (state)", "U-boats commissioned in 1938", "German Type IX submarines", "Operation Regenbogen (U-boat)"], "title": "German submarine U-38 (1938)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7703770", "text": "National Memorial Arch\n\nThe United States National Memorial Arch, located in Valley Forge National Historical Park, Chester County, Pennsylvania, is a monument built to celebrate the arrival of General George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. Valley Forge was the military camp 18 miles northwest of Philadelphia where the American Continental Army spent the winter of 1777–78 during the American Revolutionary War. Starvation, disease, malnutrition, and exposure killed more than 2,500 American soldiers by the end of February 1778.\n\nThe Memorial Arch was planned during the height of the post-Civil War memory boom. During this period of around 50 years, many monuments were planned and built in the United States, many of which are on the National Mall. As a result, the architectural style of the Arch mirrors many of the monuments.\n\nThe Memorial Arch is dedicated \"to the officers and private soldiers of the Continental Army December 19, 1777 June 19, 1778\". The Arch is situated at the top of a hill at the intersection of Gulph Road and Outer Line Drive in Valley Forge National Historical Park.\n\nThe United States National Memorial Arch was designed by Paul Philippe Cret with hopes its styles would mirror a simplified version of the Triumphal Arch of Titus in Rome (marked the capture of Jerusalem by Emperor Titus in A.D. 70). Paul Philippe Cret was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and was originally from France, studying at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. In classical architecture, the triumphal arch was erected to honor generals and emperors. The United States National Memorial Arch does so by offering a national tribute to George Washington and his army. The Arch stands at 60 feet tall.\n\nIn 1907, the Valley Forge Park Commission planned the construction of two arches, the Washington Arch at the Valley Creek entrance, and a von Steuben Arch at the park entrance on the opposite end. Both arches were designed to serve as entrance gates to welcome park visitors as well as monuments honoring the two generals and their troops. In 1908, Congressman Irving P. Wanger introduced a bill to Congress to get funding for the two arches. The two arches were given a bill of $50,000 each, which was approved by the House of Representatives in March 1910, but failed in the Senate later that year. Instead, a bill for one arch was approved in October 1910 for $100,000. Funds were distributed in 1911, and construction began in 1914. The arch was formally dedicated to George Washington and his troops on June 19th, 1917. When the National Memorial Arch was dedicated in June 19, 1917, patriotism in the U.S. was strong due to ongoing battles in World War 1 which engendered significant interest in the memorial. A train of Pullman cars brought members of Congress to Valley Forge on the day of the ceremony where they attached platforms with red-white-and-blue bunting in a celebration of patriotism. Pennsylvania Governor Martin Brumbaugh spoke of the spirit of Valley Forge and its importance during hard times.\n\nTo ensure the arch was still in good health, a restoration project began in 1996 headed by the Freemasons of Pennsylvania. The project had a budget of $1.5 million and provided nine tons of stabilizing steel to ensure the monument was structurally sound. The restoration project ended in 1997. The Valley Forge Historical Park attracts 1 million yearly visitors, and the National Memorial Arch draws in 300,000 of these.

It was first performed at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo on 14 February 1905, with Mary Garden in the title role.\n\nThe story is a light-hearted addition to Beaumarchais' Figaro plays, the action taking place soon after that of \"The Marriage of Figaro\", and imagines festivities in celebration of Chérubin's first military commission and seventeenth birthday. A farcical romp ensues, brought on by Chérubin lusting after each of the female characters and inspiring general confusion.\n\nThe piece contains some of Massenet's most shimmering, charming music and has spawned a few contemporary revivals plus several recordings since 1980. The Royal Opera House in London premiered it on 14 February 1994 in a production starring Susan Graham in the title role. The performance was broadcast.\n\nChérubin, the young page of Count Almaviva, has just received a commission in the army. The Philosopher, Chérubin's teacher, announces to the servants that there will be celebrations to mark this event. The Duke and the Baron reveal that Chérubin has invited the famous Spanish dancer L'Ensoleillad to the party. Nina, the Countess's maid, confesses to the Philosopher that she loves Chérubin.\n\nChérubin arrives, greeting the men, kissing the hands of the women, and secretly slipping a love letter to the Countess. When the guests leave to celebrate, Chérubin tells the Philosopher that he is in love with both L'Ensoleillad and the Countess. Suddenly, the Count storms in and threatens to kill Chérubin because he just discovered the secret love letter from the page to the Countess. Nina saves the page's life when she is able to recite all the verses of the love letter and claims that it was really written to her. Stupefied but calmed down, the Count apologizes to the Countess and they return to the banquet. The Philosopher remains to hear Chérubin proclaim once again that he loves both L'Ensoleillad and the Countess.\n\nAt an inn not far from the Count's castle, arriving travelers argue with the Innkeeper about securing rooms for the night, complaining about the low quality of the facilities. Even the Countess and the Baroness are not happy with what they have received. Soon officers arrive and want to celebrate Chérubin's recent commission. When Chérubin arrives, he flirts with the mistress of Captain Ricardo, and Ricardo challenges Chérubin to a duel. The sudden arrival of L'Ensoleillad postpones the duel, but not for long. Ricardo and Chérubin begin to fight, when the Philosopher intervenes and arranges a truce. The officers leave. Chérubin successfully seduces L'Ensoleillad.\n\nChérubin stands outside L'Ensoleillad's balcony, which is next to the balconies of the Countess and the Baroness, and serenades her. Each of the three women thinks that Chérubin's song is really addressed to her, and each drops him a keepsake. The Duke, the Count, and the Baron discover that Chérubin is pursuing their wives, and become furious. They come out of hiding and challenge Chérubin to give them satisfaction. Chérubin flees.\n\nOutside the inn, Chérubin prepares for the three duels awaiting him, and writes his last will. The Philosopher arrives and gives him a practical lesson on different fighting techniques, but is interrupted by the Innkeeper, who is horrified to see the combat. The Countess and the Baroness come from the inn seeking Chérubin, determined to discover whom he was serenading last night. He confesses to them that it was really L'Ensoleillad he was serenading. Satisfied with the explanation, the Count and the Baron then call off their respective duels, but Chérubin finds himself heartbroken when he sees L'Ensoleillad leaving the inn in glory and not even acknowledging him.\n\nFinally, when Nina arrives and tells Chérubin she is going to enter a convent because he doesn't love her as much she loves him, Chérubin realizes the mistakes he has made, and that she is the right woman for him. He convinces her to stay with him because it is she whom he truly loves. The Duke also cancels his duel with Chérubin when the page announces to him and to all his love for Nina.\n\n\n", "id": "7703799", "categories": ["Opera world premieres at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo", "1905 operas", "French-language operas", "Operas by Jules Massenet", "Operas"], "title": "Chérubin"}

The submarine was laid down on 15 March 1937 at the DeSchiMAG AG Weser yard in Bremen, launched on 14 May 1938, and commissioned on 4 August 1938 under the command of \"Kapitänleutnant\" Heinrich Schuch as part of the 6th U-boat Flotilla.\n\nBetween August 1939 and March 1941, \"U-37\" conducted eleven combat patrols, sinking 53 merchant ships, for a total of ; and two warships, the British , and the French submarine \"Sfax\" (Q182). \"U-37\" was then withdrawn from front-line service and assigned to training units until the end of the war. On 8 May 1945 the U-boat was scuttled in Sonderburg Bay, off Flensburg. \"U-37\" was the sixth most successful U-boat in World War II.\n\nAs one of the eight original German Type IX submarines, later designated IXA, \"U-37\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of .

When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"U-37\" was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.\n\n\"U-37\" left Wilhelmshaven, with \"Kapitänleutnant\" Heinrich Schuch in command, on 19 August 1939. The boat operated for nearly four weeks in the North Atlantic, returning to port on 15 September 1939.\n\n\"U-37\" left Wilhelmshaven on 5 October 1939 to conduct operations in the North Atlantic now under the command of \"Korvettenkapitän\" Werner Hartmann. During this patrol she sank eight ships: four British, two Greek, one French and one Swedish, including the British steam freighter \"Yorkshire\" which was traveling with the Allied convoy HG-3, sailing from Gibraltar to Liverpool, England. Hartmann returned his boat to port on 8 November after nearly five weeks at sea.\n\nOn 1 January 1940 \"U-37\" was reassigned to the 2nd U-boat Flotilla based at Wilhelmshaven. On 28 January 1940 the U-boat departed for the North Atlantic, with Werner Hartmann in command. As on his previous patrol, Hartmann sank eight ships, this time three British, two Norwegian, one Danish, one French and one Greek. Of these ships, two were in convoy at the time. \"U-37\" returned to Wilhelmshaven on 27 February.\n\n\"U-37\" departed Wilhelmshaven on 30 March for Werner Hartmann's third consecutive patrol, this time around Norway. Again, Hartmann proved successful, sinking three ships; the Norwegian \"Tosca\", the Swedish \"Sveaborg\" and the British \"Stancliffe\". After patrolling for over two weeks, the U-boat returned to Wilhelmshaven on 18 April.\n\nUnder a new captain, \"Kapitänleutnant\" Victor Oehrn, \"U-37\" departed from Wilhelmshaven on 15 May for a patrol around Portugal and Spain. \"U-37\" had her most successful mission, hitting eleven ships, sinking ten of them. Three French ships were sunk, two Greek, two British, one Swedish, one Argentinian, one Finnish; one British ship was damaged. After three and a half weeks at sea, \"U-37\" returned to Wilhelmshaven on 9 June.\n\nThe neutral Argentinian ship was \"Uruguay\", sailing from Rosario to Limerick with a cargo of maize. \"U-37\" surfaced and stopped \"Uruguay\" and examined her papers, then sank her with scuttling charges. Her crew of 28 were left in their lifeboats. Fifteen died, 13 survived.\n\n\"U-37\" sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 1 August, again with Victor Oehrn in command. This week and a half long patrol in the Atlantic off the west coast of Ireland resulted in the sinking of a single British ship, \"Upwey Grange\". \"U-37\" returned to port on 12 August, but rather than head back to Wilhelmshaven, she made for Lorient in France, where the \"2nd U-boat Flotilla\" was now based.\n\nFor the first time, \"U-37\" began a patrol from a location other than Germany, in Lorient on 17 August, with Victor Oehrn in command once more. It was to focus on operations off the south-west coast of Ireland. Seven ships were sunk during this voyage; five of which were British, one Norwegian, and one Greek. Of these ships, one was from convoy OA 220, the British \"Brookwood\", traveling from Britain to the Australia, two were from convoy SC 1, the British sloop and \"Blarimore\", sailing from Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, to the United Kingdom. After two weeks at sea, \"U-37\" returned to Lorient on 30 August.\n\nOn 24 September, \"U-37\" departed Lorient on Victor Oehrn's fourth patrol, in which he would sail to the North Atlantic. During this month-long operation \"U-37\" sank six ships, four of which were in convoy at the time of attack, all of which were British. Five of these six ships were sailing under the British flag, while the sixth was from Egypt. The British ship \"Corrientes\" was sunk as part of OB-217, sailing from Liverpool to North America. \"Heminge\" was sailing as part of OB-220, also sailing from Liverpool to North America. \"British General\" was sunk while sailing as part of convoy OA 222, sailing from Britain to North America. The fourth ship sunk was the British \"Stangrant\", sailing as part of convoy HX 77 from Halifax to the United Kingdom. The U-boat returned to Lorient on 22 October.\n\nAfter over a month in port, \"U-37\" departed with a new captain, \"Oberleutnant zur See\" Asmus Nicolai Clausen on 28 November for operations around north-west Africa and Spain. Seven ships were sunk during this patrol; two French, two Swedish, two British and one Spanish. Of these seven ships, three were in convoy at the time of their sinking. The Swedish \"Gwalia\" and \"Daphne\" and the British \"Jeanne M\" were sailing as part of convoy OG 46 from Britain to Gibraltar. The French vessels, the oiler \"Rhône\" and the submarine \"Sfax\" belonged to Vichy France and were sunk in error. After five weeks on the high seas, \"U-37\" returned to Lorient on 14 January 1941.\n\n\"U-37\" left Lorient on 30 January 1941 to patrol off the coast of Portugal. On 8 February she spotted Convoy HG-53. The next day, \"U-37\" sank two British ships, \"Courland\" and \"Estrellano\". The third merchant vessel that \"U-37\" sank on her tenth patrol was the British ship \"Brandenburg\", on 10 February. The U-boat then returned to Lorient on 18 February after spending 20 days at sea and sinking 4,781 tons of shipping.\n\nLeaving Lorient for the final time on 27 February 1941, \"U-37\"s last patrol took her to the waters south of Iceland. There she sank two vessels, the Greek cargo ship \"Mentor\" on 7 March, and the Icelandic trawler \"Pétursey\" on the 12th. After spending 24 days at sea, \"U-37\" entered the port of Kiel on 22 March.\n\nOn 1 May 1941 \"U-37\" was reassigned to the 26th U-boat Flotilla, based at Pillau (now Baltiysk, Russia) as a training U-boat. She was transferred to the 22nd U-boat Flotilla, based at Gotenhafen (now Gdynia, Poland) on 1 April 1942, and finally to the 4th U-boat Flotilla on 1 July 1944, where she remained until the end of the war.\n\nShe was scuttled by her crew in May 1945.\n\nThe British war propaganda film \"49th Parallel\" (1941) uses the name U-37 for the German submarine whose crew comes ashore in Canada during WW2. The craft is shown being blown up in Hudson Bay. The film was released shortly after the real \"U-37\" was removed from active service.\n\nIn the 1943 war film \"Action in the North Atlantic\", the U-boat in the opening scenes is titled U-37.\n\n", "id": "7703856", "categories": ["1938 ships", "World War II submarines of Germany", "Ships built in Bremen (state)", "U-boats commissioned in 1938", "German Type IX submarines", "Operation Regenbogen (U-boat)"], "title": "German submarine U-37 (1938)"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7703893", "text": "Legend of the Sacred Stone\n\nLegend of the Sacred Stone is a 2000 Taiwanese puppetry feature film written and directed by Chris Huang, a spin-off from the glove puppetry \"wuxia\" television series \"Pili\". It reflects the traditional Taiwanese style of glove puppetry known there as \"budaixi\", supplemented by computer-generated imagery.\n\nThroughout the storyline within this movie film, 400 years within the past is where it is meant to be taking place. The story begins when a man by the name of Mo Kuei threatens the people to the extent that he will destroy all of Wulin, which had been the forest of residence for the warriors of Wulin. A certain sage by the name of Su Huan-jen had responded to this conflict by summoning three specific warriors from different schools of martial arts to assist him. These three warriors would then wait within ambush for Mo Kuei to gather his spiritual energy amongst the summit of the mountain. The story continues onward in which Lord Jian almost becomes sealed by certain protectors of Wulin. Many conflicts follow this in which Jian loses all of his powers and lusts to find the Sacred Stone to regain his powers.\n\n\"Main characters\"\n\n\"Other characters\"\n\nSu Huan-Jen: The main character within the Legend of the Sacred Stone film. Huan-Jen was regularly referred to as White Lotus through his purity of mind and character. No matter how extreme of circumstances, Huan-Jen will always reflect calmness within his art of the sword and inner mind even when he consists of merely one arm. Huan-Jen is renowned for his excelled abilities with his sword. Huan-Jen also reflects various traits such as being clever within his tactics and rather wise. His ultimate goal is to restore Wulin to its former power even if it costs him his life in the process. Huan-Jen later vows to destroy Lord Jian after he sees his brother dead right before him.\n\nAo Hsiao Hong-Chen: The primary subordinate character within Legend of the Sacred Stone. Hong-Chen had been an old friend of Lord Jian. The many unforeseen events within his life, such as his friend becoming rather distorted of mind has led for him to have no true desire towards political power. Through this, Hong-Chen has searched for many years towards a more pure way with the world. After some years had passed by, he soon became rather obsessed with spiritual power, and a rather strong sense of justice. However, Hong-Chen can act impulsively at times when his sense of justice is challenged in any type of way. It is noted that Hong-Chen is even a greater swordsman than that of Su Huan-Jen which was proved through a certain serious duel to the death between each other.\n\nChing Yang-Zi: A very close friend to that of Su Huan-Jen. He is always with Huan-Jen, and they regularly call each other brothers due to their closeness. Yang-Zi possesses a certain unique ability with the harp weapon, in which he can transmit spiritual power and use at will within battle. It is also known that Yang-Zi is brave of heart and is a rather noted gentleman. At one time within the story, Yang-Zi attempts to flee with Ru-Bing in hopes of escaping the demon allies of Lord Jian. After Yang-Zi is severely wounded and near death, he had kept continuing to protect Ru-Bing for the sake of his brother. However, after he made a secure rout of escape for Ru-Bing, he would see his last against three specific demons, in which he had violently unleashed his powers amongst the melee. Yang-Zi however was dealt the final slash by the enemy, in which he stood alone with blood rushing forth from his body, never to wake again.\n\nJian Ru-Bing: A rather beautiful woman who had been well known as the daughter of Lord Jian. Ru-Bing is daily forced to carry around her father's hatred towards their past village. Ru-Bing's actions, which are partially driven through fear, result in her acting in any way that complies with her father. Ru-Bing even went to the extent as to attempt to retrieve the Sacred Stone from Hell's Valley to restore her father's face, and spiritual power. Ru-Bing is also the secret love of Su Huan-Jen. In the end however, Ru-Bing sadly sacrifices her life to the Sacred Stone so that her father can become restored. This is because the Sacred Stone requires an equal sacrifice to attain a greater goal.\n\nLord Jian: The primary villain within the Legend of the Sacred Stone, and father of Ru-Bing. Jian had at one time been noted as a kind man of noble descent, even to the extent that he was known as the \"Great Protector\". Later however, his younger brother would find a certain artifact known as the Sacred Stone, which caused many demons to attack him (in which is where his face became ruined) and to have his whole family slaughtered. This caused for a large distortion within Jian, leading for him to possess an immense blood lust. Jian will stop at nothing to fin the Sacred Stone for revenge, even if it costs him being sealed away or killed. Jian's hatred leads for him to become enemies with the warriors of Wulin, even leading for many to be recruited to act against him. His ultimate goal is to restore his face and attain unlimited power, even if it costs his daughter's death. In the end however, his daughter is sacrificed, and he is finally defeated after a long battle against both Su Huan-Jen and Hsiao Hong-Chen.\n\nJian Wei: The sworn protector of Lord Jian. Jian Wei had served as Jian's protector even at a young age, and will continue to serve him even if he had become distorted of mind. However, Jian Wei still wishes for Lord Jian to return to his old self and will stop at nothing to see his true master's self again. Later within the story, Jian Wei runs away with Ru-Bing when he acquires the Sacred Stone, as to save Lord Jian from his ambition. Jian later catches up with Jian Wei and slays him without a second thought.\n\nThe techniques used in Legend of the Sacred Stone and the Pili TV series are glove puppetry, CG animation, and wires are sometimes used when characters are fighting to flip them around in the air. Unlike other hand puppets, budaixi puppets have legs.\n\nThere are two versions of the film on DVD - the uncut 120-minute version from Taiwan, which has no English subtitles, and the truncated 99-minute version from Japan, with English subtitles. The Japanese DVDs advertise a \"129-minute\" running time, but this includes the special features.\n\n", "id": "7703893", "categories": ["2000 films", "Glove puppetry", "Films featuring puppetry", "Taiwanese films"], "title": "Legend of the Sacred Stone"}

He then returned to running Pate Asphalt in Marion, Iowa.\n\nOn January 18, 2010, Pate filed paperwork to notify the Iowa Election Board that he was considering a run for his former position as Iowa Secretary of State against Democratic incumbent Michael Mauro. He was reportedly intrigued at the idea of being able to run for office alongside former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. However, he decided not to run for the office. He did however decide to run four years later after Republican incumbent Matt Schultz instead ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for Iowa's 3rd congressional district. Pate was unopposed in the Republican primary and faced Democrat Brad Anderson in the 2014 general election. Pate defeated Anderson 49% to 47%, returning to the office of Iowa Secretary of State 20 years after he was first elected to the position.\n\nUpon returning to the Secretary of State's office, Pate set out to institute a Safe at Home program in Iowa. Safe at Home is an address confidentiality program for survivors of domestic violence, sexual abuse, trafficking and stalking. The bill passed both chambers of the Iowa Legislature unanimously and was signed into law by Governor Terry Branstad in May 2015. Secretary Pate's Office administers the program.\n\nPaul Pate was selected to participate in the prestigious 2015 Toll Fellowship Program. It is a leadership development program for state government officials, bringing 48 of the nation’s top officials from all three branches of state government together for an intensive six-day intellectual boot camp. Google awarded Secretary Pate in July 2015 for his efforts to increase voter participation in Iowa. The award was presented during the National Association of Secretaries of State's annual conference.\n\nSecretary Pate was named the co-chair of the National Association of Secretaries of State’s Standing Committee on Business Services in July 2015. Pate was named the co-chair of the NASS Business ID Theft Task Force in March 2016. Secretary Pate was elected the Midwestern Region Vice-president of the National Association of Secretaries of State in July 2016, Treasurer for NASS in 2017 and was unanimously chosen as President-Elect for NASS in July 2018. \n\nSecretary Pate's Office partnered with the Iowa Department of Transportation to launch online voter registration in Iowa on January 1, 2016. Approximately 70,000 Iowans utilized the system to register to vote in 2016. Iowa continually broke voter registration records during Secretary Pate's current tenure, reaching an all-time high of 2,045,864 active registered voters in January 2017. \n\nPate's efforts in voter education for Iowa's youth were recognized in March 2017 when he was named the winner of the National State Boards of Education Award for Outstanding Leadership in Voter Education. Pate was rewarded for his efforts in conducting two statewide Iowa Youth Straw Polls and the Iowa Youth Caucus, which included hundreds of schools and tens of thousands of student participants. Pate was the recipient of the Election Center's 2018 Professional Practice State Award for his office's training materials for poll workers. \n\nThe Council of State Governments appointed Secretary Pate to its Executive Committee and International Committee in 2017. CSG cited Pate's commitment to advancing the efforts of the council’s Overseas Voting Initiative, designed to improve the return rate of overseas absentee ballots from service members and U.S. citizens living abroad.\n\nPaul Pate was reelected as Iowa's Secretary of State in November 2018, defeating Democratic challenger Deidre DeJear by eight points.\n\nOn January 15, 2019, Paul Pate announced that he failed to fulfill his constitutional duty regarding proposed constitutional amendments. The Iowa Constitution mandates that the Secretary of State must notify the public of any amendment proposals for three months prior to a general election and follow any other prescribed statutes which are currently delineated in the Iowa Code, which further mandates that the Secretary of State must publish the amendment proposal in two newspapers in each of Iowa's four congressional districts. Through bureaucratic error, Pate did not initiate this process, causing two constitutional amendment proposals which were passed by the 87th Iowa Legislature in 2018 to effectively be pocket vetoed. The first amendment proposal was to clarify the succession of the Iowa governor and lieutenant governor in the event of the governor's death, impeachment or resignation. The second amendment proposal was to add a right to keep and bear arms provision to the constitution. The error generated considerable backlash from Second Amendment advocates.\n", "id": "7703957", "categories": ["21st-century American politicians", "People from Hiawatha, Iowa", "Iowa Republicans", "Living people", "1958 births", "Mayors of Cedar Rapids, Iowa", "Iowa state senators", "People from Wapello County, Iowa"], "title": "Paul Pate"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7703977", "text": "Human science\n\nHuman science studies the philosophical, biological, social, and cultural aspects of human life. Human Sciences aims to expand our understanding of the human world through a broad interdisciplinary approach. It encompasses a wide range of fields - including history, philosophy, genetics, sociology, psychology, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, neurosciences and anthropology. It is the study and interpretation of the experiences, activities, constructs, and artifacts associated with human beings. The study of the human sciences attempts to expand and enlighten the human being's knowledge of their existence, its interrelationship with other species and systems, and the development of artifacts to perpetuate the human expression and thought. It is the study of human phenomena. The study of the human experience is historical and current in nature. It requires the evaluation and interpretation of the historic human experience and the analysis of current human activity to gain an understanding of human phenomena and to project the outlines of human evolution. Human science is the objective, informed critique of human existence and how it relates to reality.\n\nAmbiguity and confusion regarding usage of the terms 'science', 'empirical science', and 'scientific method' have complicated the usage of the term 'human science' with respect to human activities. The term 'science' is derived from the Latin \"scientia\" meaning 'knowledge'. 'Science' may be appropriately used to refer to any branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged to show the operation of general laws.\n\nHowever, according to positivists, the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge which comes from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific method, the application of knowledge or mathematics. As a result of the positivist influence, the term \"science\" is frequently employed as a synonym for \"empirical science\". Empirical science is knowledge based on the scientific method, a systematic approach to verification of knowledge first developed for dealing with natural physical phenomena and emphasizing the importance of experience based on sensory observation. However, even with regard to the natural sciences, significant difference exist among scientists and philosophers of science with regard to what constitutes valid scientific method—for example, evolutionary biology, geology and astronomy, studying events that cannot be repeated, can use a method of historical narratives. More recently, usage of the term has been extended to the study of human social phenomena. Thus, natural and social sciences are commonly classified as science, whereas the study of classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and the visual and performing arts are referred to as the humanities. Ambiguity with respect to the meaning of the term \"science\" is aggravated by the widespread use of the term formal science with reference to any one of several sciences that is predominantly concerned with abstract form that cannot be validated by physical experience through the senses, such as logic, mathematics, and the theoretical branches of computer science, information theory, and statistics.\n\nThe phrase 'human science' in English was used during the 17th-century scientific revolution, for example by Theophilus Gale, to draw a distinction between supernatural knowledge (divine science) and study by humans (human science). John Locke also uses 'human science' to mean knowledge produced by people, but without the distinction. By the 20th century, this latter meaning was used at the same time as 'sciences that make human beings the topic of research'.\n\nHuman science (also, humanistic social science, moral science and human sciences) refers to the investigation of human life and activities via an interdisciplinary framework spanning the sciences and humanities. Underlying Human science is the relationship between various humanistic modes of inquiry within fields such as, history, sociology, anthropology and economics, and advances in such things as genetics, evolutionary biology and the social sciences for the purpose of understanding our lives in a rapidly changing world. Its use of an empirical methodology that encompasses psychological experience contrasts to the purely positivistic approach typical of the natural sciences which exclude all methods not based solely on sensory observations. Modern approaches in the human sciences integrate an understanding of human structure, function and adaptation with a broader exploration of what it means to be human. The term is also used to distinguish not only the content of a field of study from those of the natural sciences, but also its methodology.\n\nThe term moral science was used by David Hume (1711-1776) in his \"Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals\" to refer to the systematic study of human nature and relationships. Hume wished to establish a \"science of human nature\" based upon empirical phenomena, and excluding all that does not arise from observation. Rejecting teleological, theological and metaphysical explanations, Hume sought to develop an essentially descriptive methodology; phenomena were to be precisely characterized. He emphasized the necessity of carefully explicating the cognitive content of ideas and vocabulary, relating these to their empirical roots and real-world significance.\n\nA variety of early thinkers in the humanistic sciences took up Hume's direction. Adam Smith, for example, conceived of economics as a moral science in the Humean sense.\n\nPartly in reaction to the establishment of positivist philosophy and the latter's Comtean intrusions into traditionally humanistic areas such as sociology, non-postivistic researchers in the humanistic sciences began to carefully but emphatically distinguish the methodological approach appropriate to these areas of study, for which the unique and distinguishing characteristics of phenomena are in the forefront (e.g. for the biographer), from that appropriate to the natural sciences, for which the ability to link phenomena into generalized groups is foremost. In this sense, Johann Gustav Droysen contrasted the humanistic science's need to \"comprehend\" the phenomena under consideration with natural science's need to \"explain\" phenomena, while Windelband coined the terms idiographic for a descriptive study of the individual nature of phenomena, and nomothetic for sciences that aim to define the generalizing laws.\n\nWilhelm Dilthey brought nineteenth-century attempts to formulate a methodology appropriate to the humanistic sciences together with Hume's term \"moral science\", which he translated as \"Geisteswissenschaft\" - a term with no exact English equivalent. Dilthey attempted to articulate the entire range of the moral sciences in a comprehensive and systematic way. Meanwhile, his conception of “Geisteswissenschaften” encompasses also the abovementioned study of classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and the visual and performing arts. He characterized the scientific nature of a study as depending upon:\nBut the specific nature of the \"Geisteswissenschaften\" is based on the \"inner\" experience (\"Erleben\"), the \"comprehension\" (\"Verstehen\") of the meaning of expressions and \"understanding\" in terms of the relations of the part and the whole – in contrast to the \"Naturwissenschaften\", the \"explanation\" of phenomena by hypothetical laws in the \"natural sciences\".\n\nEdmund Husserl, a student of Franz Brentano, articulated his phenomenological philosophy in a way that could be thought as a basis of Dilthey's attempt. Dilthey appreciated Husserl's \"Logische Untersuchungen\" (1900/1901, the first draft of Husserl's \"Phenomenology\") as an “epoch making“ epistemological foundation of his conception of Geisteswissenschaften.\n\nIn recent years, 'human science' has been used to refer to \"a philosophy and approach to science that seeks to understand human experience in deeply subjective, personal, historical, contextual, cross-cultural, political, and spiritual terms. Human science is the science of qualities rather than of quantities and closes the subject-object split in science. In particular, it addresses the ways in which self-reflection, art, music, poetry, drama, language and imagery reveal the human condition. By being interpretive, reflective, and appreciative, human science re-opens the conversation among science, art, and philosophy.\"\n\nSince Auguste Comte, the positivistic social sciences have sought to imitate the approach of the natural sciences by emphasizing the importance of objective external observations and searching for universal laws whose operation is predicated on external initial conditions that do not take into account differences in subjective human perception and attitude. Critics argue that subjective human experience and intention plays such a central role in determining human social behavior that an objective approach to the social sciences is too confining. Rejecting the positivist influence, they argue that the scientific method can rightly be applied to subjective, as well as objective, experience. The term subjective is used in this context to refer to inner psychological experience rather than outer sensory experience. It is not used in the sense of being prejudiced by personal motives or beliefs.\n\nThe Human Sciences degree is relatively young. It has been a degree subject at Oxford since 1969, and at UCL was proposed in 1973 by Professor J. Z. Young and implemented two years later. His aim was to train general science graduates who would be scientifically literate, numerate and easily able to communicate across a wide range of disciplines, replacing the traditional Classics training for higher-level government and management careers. Central topics include the evolution of humans, their behaviour, molecular and population genetics, population growth and ageing, ethnic and cultural diversity and the human interaction with the environment, including conservation, disease and nutrition. The study of both biological and social disciplines, integrated within a framework of human diversity and sustainability, should enable the human scientist to develop professional competencies suited to address such multidimensional human problems. In the United Kingdom, Human Sciences is offered at degree level at several institutions. These include:\n\n\nThe Human Science Lab (HSL) is a global centre for world-leading research on evolutionary, biological and behavioural aspect of human species. It is located in Oxfordshire and London. Its current research focus are human cognition, motivation, intelligence, leadership, critical thinking, learning, ergonomics and human well-being.\n\nIt adopts a multi-disciplinary approach for most of its research incorporating neuroscience, anthropology, psychology, evolutionary biology, genetics, and physiology.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7703977", "categories": [], "title": "Human science"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7704032", "text": "Tingmissartoq\n\nTingmissartoq was the name given to a Lockheed Model 8 Sirius flown by Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh in the 1930s. \"Tingmissartoq\" means \"one who flies like a big bird\"; the plane was thus christened by an Inuit boy in Godthaab (Nuuk), Greenland, who painted the word on its side.\n\nLockheed had introduced its Sirius model in 1929; this particular craft appears to have been built to specifications sometime between then and 1931, when the Lindberghs planned to fly to the Orient via the Great Circle Route. A low-wing monoplane, \"Tingmissartoq\" was outfitted with Edo floats, as much of the planned route was over water.\n\nThe trip was described solely as a vacation flight, with \"no start or finish, no diplomatic or commercial significance, and no records to be sought.\" It began in North Haven, Maine, from which point the couple flew to Ottawa. From there they flew to various other sites in Canada, including Moose Factory, Churchill, Baker Lake, and Aklavik, before heading to Point Barrow, Alaska. They continued on to Shismaref and Nome, after which they crossed the Pacific Ocean to Petropavlosk. From here they continued over the Kuril Islands to Tokyo, where they were enthusiastically welcomed. The trip continued on to China, with its final stop on Lotus Lake near Nanking made on September 19.\n\nAnne Morrow Lindbergh described the trip, and her impressions and experiences, in her book \"North to the Orient\".\n\nWhile at Hankow, the plane, with the Lindberghs aboard, was being lowered into the Yangtze River from the British aircraft carrier when it capsized accidentally. One wing hit a ship's cable and was damaged, necessitating the craft's return to the United States for repairs.\n\n\"Tingmissartoq\" was to see action again in 1933 as a result of international interest in the development of commercial air transport. Pan American Airways, Imperial Airways, Deutsche Luft Hansa, KLM, and Air France collaborated on a study of international air routes. The assigned areas were Newfoundland to Europe via Greenland; Newfoundland via the great circle route to Ireland; Newfoundland southeast to the Azores and Lisbon; Miami, Bermuda, the Azores, and Lisbon; and across the South Atlantic from Brazil, to Cape Verde. Pan American was given the responsibility for the first of these, and sent Lindbergh, as the company's technical advisor, to survey the route. Accompanied once more by Anne, he took off from New York City on July 9 in the rebuilt craft. The purpose of the trip was to gain as much data as possible on the area to be covered.\n\nThe plane had been fitted with a Sperry artificial horizon and a directional gyro since its previous flight. The engine, too, was new, a Wright Cyclone SR1820-F2 of 710 hp. All possible spaces were used, including the wings and floats; these contained the gasoline tanks. There was also plenty of emergency equipment for use in the event of a forced landing.\n\nTo maintain radio contact with the couple, Pan American hired a Danish ship, the \"Jellinge\", to stay within range in the area of Labrador, Greenland, and Iceland. It also delivered advance supplies for them to Halifax, St. John's, Cartwright, Greenland, and Iceland.\n\n\"Tingmissartoq\" flew first from New York to Hopedale, Labrador, hugging the eastern Canada–US border along the way. From here the Lindberghs made the first major hop over water, flying 650 miles to Godthaab. The couple then crisscrossed Greenland to Baffin Island and back, and then flew to Iceland. They continued the trip by flying around the world; visiting first the major cities of Europe, they continued to Moscow, then down Africa's west coast, and across the South Atlantic to South America. Here, they flew down the Amazon River, and then turned north through Trinidad and Barbados before returning to the United States. They returned to New York on December 19, having traveled 30,000 miles and visited four continents and twenty-one countries. The information they provided proved invaluable in planning transatlantic air transport routes.\n\n\"Tingmissartoq\" was on display in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City until 1955, when it was acquired by the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. It was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution in 1959, and is currently on display in the \"Pioneers of Flight\" gallery of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.\n\n", "id": "7704032", "categories": ["Floatplanes", "Charles Lindbergh", "Individual aircraft", "Individual aircraft in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution"], "title": "Tingmissartoq"}

They purchased the Wayne Country Club, which they transformed into Tyler Hill Camp in 1956. A third partner, Bob Weinberger, sold his share to Heft and Bernstein after a few seasons. It makes part of The TLC Family of Camps, which feature five of the most recognized and respected camps on the East Coast: Timber Lake, Tyler Hill, Timber Lake West, North Shore Day Camp and Hampton Country Day Camp.\n\nLocated on , Tyler Hill Camp features two lakes (Silver and Laurel) for boating, and waterskiing, 12 tennis courts, 4 softball/baseball fields, 7 basketball courts (1 mini court), 1 regulation roller hockey rink (1 smaller one) and an on-site 18-hole par 3 and 4 golf course.\n\nThe first major addition to camp in the 1990s was an swimming pool in 1992. The pool was built where a hard-top volleyball court once stood down by Silver Lake. The same year, former Boys Bunk 1 and 2 was converted into a movie theater, featuring a projection screen, seats from the then recently renovated Callicoon movie theater.\n\nDuring the summer of 1995, a new regulation roller hockey rink was built. The following summer, a new basketball court was built right next to the hockey rink. Both the hockey rink and basketball court were covered in 1997, completing the Tylerdome. The dome featured high ceilings and was open on all sides, allowing for cool breezes throughout the hot summer days, but shelter from the intense sun and offered an alternative location for rainy day activities.\n\nIn 2002, a wrap-around porch was added to the canteen and the following year, the interior was renovated, adding wood paneling throughout the perimeter of the building. Two new boys and girls bunks were also added due to the increasing camp enrollment, allowing for more space in the latter bunks. In the early part of the decade, the main and secondary roads that lined the campus were paved, followed by the addition of new footpaths in 2006.\nDuring the winter of 2002 & 2003, the Social Hall suffered extensive roof damage after a sizable amount of snowfall. The building was irreparable, so plans were drawn up to construct a new, larger building. The foundation was laid in 2003 and the building was officially completed for the 2004 summer season. The building features a state-of-the-art sound booth in the back of the building, with costume rooms, larger bathrooms and a dance room and weight room off to either sides. The building received another facelift in the fall of 2006, when hard wood flooring was placed throughout the building.\n\nFor the summer of 2006, the Arts and Crafts building received a much needed renovation. Also the former Cooking Shack (formerly the Nature Shack) was taken down and a patio was put on the foundation to make a cooking and seating area for breakfast and lunch. Cooking was moved into the Arts & Crafts pavilion overlooking the breakfast and lunch area. In the fall of 2006, construction began on a new Gymnastics pavilion overlooking Silver Lake. This pavilion replaced the existing gymnastics facility.\n\nIn 2006, Andy Siegel and his wife Wendy assumed the position as Director/Owners of Tyler Hill Camp, along with Justin Mayer as Assistant Director and Bette Jane Weisenthal as Associate Director of Girls Camp.\n\nIn 2009, the popular movie theater was changed back into bunks (23 and 24) due to the enrollment of 35 new campers. A new movie theater was constructed behind boys bunks 5 and 6.\n\nShortly after the summer of 2009, Justin Mayer, the Assistant Director, left his position at Tyler Hill Camp for the Director position at Timber Lake West Camp. \nIn 2010, the camp Health Center received a major renovation, including an extension to accommodate additional campers and a wrap-around porch.\n\nAfter the summer of 2010, the Head of the Waterfront, Nick (\"Swim\") Williams was announced as the new Assistant Director of Tyler Hill Camp. The position of Head of Waterfront would be filled by one of the lifeguards, Luke O'Connor.\n\nPrior to the summer of 2011, the Horse Stables were converted into the new Campitheatre, which is an outdoor stage and benches set behind the Tyler Dome on Big Al Lake.\n\nAn end-of-the-summer competition where the entire camp is split into 2 teams, Blue and White, led by counselor leaders known as \"officers\". Lasting between 5 and 6 days, points are earned through athletic activities, sportsmanship, boating and swimming relays, all culminating with a singing competition. A hatchet is hidden in a well-disguised location, with clues released twice a day, leading to the hatchet's general vicinity.

Mary quickly moved up the amateur ranks in 2003 and soon became a professional figure competitor in 2004 by winning NPC National Figure Championships. Today Lado is one of the top figure competitors in the Industry, winning the Ms. Figure International on two consecutive occasions and placing in the top-five at the Ms. Figure Olympia on two different occasions.\n\nMary Lado was born in New Orleans, Louisiana is a professional figure competitor. Lado was raised amid Spanish culture; her mother, Marianela, was born in Cuba and her father, Jose, in Spain. The oldest of three, Mary along with her two brothers, Jose and Carlos were raised to be active, well-mannered individuals, who go after their dreams and work hard to achieve them. She still lives at her home state of Louisiana near her friends in a close-knit family. At an early age her parents encouraged her daughter to get involved in sports. Even as a child Lado was a naturally competitive child in different fields such as sports. In high school, Lado was on the volleyball, basketball, softball and track teams. This competitive fire helped her in her education; excelling in volleyball and softball, she received a full four-year scholarship to attend Chipola Junior College in Marianna, Florida as a pitcher, and then to Georgia Southwestern State University to play Softball. There she majored in sociology, and while she treasured her education, she felt uncomfortable studying and having to do homework was not a very enjoyable activity for her during her college years.\n\nAfter graduation Lado felt that she needed something to do in order to deal with her competitive energy since school was over and she had no sports nor people to play sports with. She toyed with free weights to stay active, when she was encouraged by relatives in the gym to compete in figure competitions. In 2003, after six months of hard training, she entered her first NPC figure contest, the New Orleans Figure Championships, and won her height class. In 2004, she came in second in the NPC Junior Nationals in her height class and won the figure overall title at the Nationals, catapulting her into the pros. In 2005, Lado entered five pro figure contests, winning the Pittsburgh Pro Figure Championships and the California Pro Figure Championships. Everything was going well at the professional level for Lado, but soon she would find herself with some personal issues that began to take their toll on her competitive career. While visiting family in Spain her hometown was hit by Hurricane Katrina. Unable to community with her family members in Louisiana for more than a week after her the disaster, Mary was in a serious emotional turmoil and for sometime thought of not attending the 2005 Ms. Figure Olympia contest (her first Olympia). But she then decided to the Olympia after being able to talk to her family in Louisiana.\n\nUnable to find adequate gyms in Spain, and only relying on Theraband exercise and outdoor cardio sessions to prepare for the Olympia contest. After returning to Louisiana, she stayed with some friends and continued her last few preparations for the contest. And while she was not in her best condition she managed to place 4th at the Sacramento Pro Figure, and 5th Figure Olympia (her last two competitions of 2005). During this time Lado asked some of the judges and professional figure competitors about what she needed to do to improve her performance on stage as well as other areas that she needed work on in order to be more competitive at the pro level. She was told that she needed more stage presence and needed to work at her conditioning as well. Mary put her newfound knowledge to work and began her preparations for the 2006 Arnold Classic, where she placed 1st. Her crowning achievement to date came at this year's Arnold Fitness Weekend, she became the only athlete besides Jenny Lynn to hold the Figure International title, in total Lado has won the title twice.\n\n\nLado's training consists of weight training 6 days a week in the off-season (usually two to three body parts per day off-season, and only one body part per day on-season). She uses a variation of compound and isolation movements (with free weights, machines and cables) in her training, focusing on her hamstrings, back, and shoulders. Mary uses between 9 sets for small bodyparts and up to 16 sets per large bodypart. She will train her legs early in the week when she is fresh and trains hamstrings twice a week. For cardio Mary uses the StepMill, Elliptical machine and the incline treadmill as her main tools. She does one to two sessions of cardio six days a week in the off-season and three sessions in the on-season.\n\n\n", "id": "7704262", "categories": ["1978 births", "Living people"], "title": "Mary Elizabeth Lado"}

Located on Ontario Highway 7, which is the Trans-Canada Highway, Omemee is one of the major communities in the Kawartha Lakes, as the proclaimed \"city\" is vastly rural and has but one major population centre. The community had a population of 1,247 in the Canada 2011 Census. It is located between the city of Peterborough and the community of Lindsay. Lindsay is the largest population centre in the city of Kawartha Lakes, and serves as the administrative centre as it did with Victoria County.\n\nOmemee was the early childhood home of musician Neil Young, and of his father, author and sportswriter Scott Young.\n\nIn late 2014 Omemee’s Youngtown museum closed for good, and shipped its content to neighbouring town Lindsay for display.\n\nAugust 2016 Omemee was featured on Canadian comedian Jonny Harris’ CBC \"Still Standing\" program. Filmed at Thanksgiving the year prior, in the town's city hall, the episode focused on Neil Young and his childhood friend, taking rifle shooting lessons from the town doctor and going adventure diving in a swimming pool.\n\nThe community that grew up around William Cottingham's mills on the Pigeon River was first called Williamstown and then Metcalfe. In 1857 the community was renamed Omemee, for the Omemee tribe, which once hunted in the area. The word means pigeon in the Mississauga language.\n\nThe construction of the Port Hope, Lindsay and Beaverton Railway in 1857 (when the town also acquired a post office) fostered the growth of the community, which became a thriving shipping point for timber and grain.\n\nUntil the 1860s, Omemee competed with Lindsay as the largest town in Victoria County. At its zenith in the late 1800s, Omemee had a grist mill, two sawmills, a tannery, a foundry, a shingle mill, a cloth mill, three churches, four hotels, an elementary and secondary school, and a newspaper.\n\nAs Ontario’s economy shifted away from agriculture and surrounding towns grew, the industrial section of Omemee declined until, 100 years later, only the Regal Stationery Company remained (the factory has since closed). Today, Omemee’s economy is supported by the town’s population as well as seasonal residents and retirement communities in the surrounding area.\n\nOmemee has two public schools: Lady Eaton Elementary (kindergarten to grade 3), and Scott Young (grades 4 to 8). Scott Young Public School was named after Scott Young, a journalist and author of many books, and father of musician Neil Young.\n\nIn 2015 due to enrolment decline in Scott Young Middle school, “to the point where both schools were below 50 per cent Ministry of Education identified capacity”, the Trillium Lakelands District School Board moved the overflow of grade 4’s from Lady Eaton over to Scott Young. Then in late 2016 it was announced that Lady Eaton Elementary school will close for good in June 2018.\n\nThough Lady Eaton is to be closed, there are plans to keep the daycare open to the public: “the board [can] work with the Omemee Children’s Centre in the hopes of moving the daycare to Scott Young”.\n\nThe ghost town of Omemee, North Dakota, was named after the Ontario Omemee, as the former's first post master hailed from the latter.\n\nIn 1970, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young released \"Déjà Vu\" with a recording of the song \"Helpless\" which was based on Neil Young's hometown Omemee, referring to the town in the first verse as, “There is a town in north Ontario...All my changes were there”.\n\nOmemee, known for being a previous railroad hub and source of heating coal for the area is going back to its roots, somewhat. As of November 2018, the old coal depot will once again be open for the coal business. Due to a breakdown in negotiations with the City of Kawartha Lakes to turn the property into a storage facility and residence with a public fruit orchard. The owner Austin Westlake has decided that the only cost effective use for the property is to create the largest coal facility in Ontario. There will be no rail service, but in the state of the art facility, customers will be able to experience coal once again. The facility is scheduled to open November 30, 2018.\n\n", "id": "7704332", "categories": [], "title": "Omemee, Ontario"}

They are so called because of their small single channel conductance in the order of 10 pS. SK channels are a type of ion channel allowing potassium cations to cross the cell membrane and are activated (opened) by an increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium through N-type calcium channels. Their activation limits the firing frequency of action potentials and is important for regulating afterhyperpolarization in the neurons of the central nervous system as well as many other types of electrically excitable cells. This is accomplished through the hyperpolarizing leak of positively charged potassium ions along their concentration gradient into the extracellular space. This hyperpolarization causes the membrane potential to become more negative. SK channels are thought to be involved in synaptic plasticity and therefore play important roles in learning and memory.\n\nSK channels are expressed throughout the central nervous system. They are highly conserved in mammals as well as in other organisms such as \"Drosophila melanogaster\" and \"Caenorhabditis elegans\". SK channels are specifically involved in the medium afterhyperpolarizing potential (mAHP). They affect both the intrinsic excitability of neurons and synaptic transmission. They are also involved in calcium signaling. SK channels control action potential discharge frequency in hippocampal neurons, midbrain dopaminergic neurons, dorsal vagal neurons, sympathetic neurons, nucleus reticularis thalmic neurons, inferior olive neurons, spinal and hypoglossal motoneurons, mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, and cortical neurons.\n\nSK potassium channels share the same basic architecture with Shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channels. Four subunits associate to form a tetramer. Each of the subunits has six transmembrane hydrophobic alpha helical domains (S1-S6). A loop between S5 and S6—called the P-loop—provides the pore-forming region that always faces the center of the channel. Each of the subunits has six hydrophobic alpha helical domains that insert into the cell membrane. A loop between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains forms the potassium ion selectivity filter. SK channels may assemble as homotetrameric channels or as heterotetrameric channels, consisting of more than one SK channel subtype. In addition, SK potassium channels are tightly associated with the protein calmodulin, which accounts for the calcium sensitivity of these channels. Calmodulin participates as a subunit of the channel itself, bound to the cytoplasmic C-terminus region of the peptide called the calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD).\n\nAdditional association of the phosphorylating kinase CK2 and dephosphorylating phosphatase PP2A on the cytoplasmic face of the protein allow for enriched Ca-sensitivity—and thus—kinetics modulation. CK2 serves to phosphorylate the SKCa-bound CaM at the T80 residue, rather than the channel helices themselves, to reduce calcium sensitivity. This may only be accomplished when the channel pore is closed. PP2A dephosphorylates this residue upon CK2 inhibition. The selectivity filter of all SK channel subtypes—whether SK1, SK2, SK3, or SK4—is highly conserved and reflects the selectivity seen in any potassium channel, a GYGD amino acid residue sequence on the pore-forming loop. These channels are considered to be voltage-independent, as they possess only two of seven positively charged amino acid residues that are typically seen in a prototypical voltage-gated potassium channel.\n\nThe SK channel family contains 4 members – SK1, SK2, SK3, and SK4. SK4 is often referred to as IK (Intermediate conductance) due to its higher conductance 20 – 80 pS.\n\nThe SK channel gating mechanism is controlled by intracellular calcium levels. Calcium enters the cell via voltage activated calcium channels as well as through NMDA receptors. Calcium does not directly bind to the SK channel. Calcium binds to the protein calmodulin (CaM). When bound to calcium, CaM binds to the CaM-binding domain on the intracellular subunit of the SK channel. When each of the four CaM-binding domain subunits is bound to calmodulin, the SK channel changes conformation. This transitions the channel from a tetramer of monomers to a folded dimer of dimers, which results in rotation of the CaM-binding domains. This rotation causes the mechanical opening of the channel gate. The time constant of SK channel activation is approximately 5 ms. When calcium levels are depleted, the time constant for channel deactivation ranges from 15–60 ms.\n\nAll SK channels can be pharmacologically blocked by quaternary ammonium salts of a plant-derived neurotoxin bicuculline. In addition, SK channels (SK1-SK3) but not SK4 (IK) are sensitive to blockade by the bee toxin apamin, and the scorpion venoms tamapin and charybdotoxin (ChTx), all via competitive antagonism for access to the mouth of the pore formation. All known blockers compete for roughly the same binding site, the pore, in all subtypes. This provides a physical blockage to the channel pore. Since all blockers are universal to all three types of SK channels, there is an incredibly narrow therapeutic window that does not allow for blocking of a specific SK channel subtype. Quaternary ammonium salts like bicuculline and tetraethylammonium (TEA) enter the pore via the selectivity filter by acting as a potassium mimic in the dehydration step of pore permeation.\n\nThe following molecules are other toxins and organic compounds that also inhibit all three small SK channel subtypes to any (even minimal) degree:\n\nAllosteric modulators of small SK channels work by changing the apparent calcium sensitivity of the channels. Examples include:\n\nIn dendritic spines, SK channels are directly coupled to NMDA receptors. In addition to being activated by calcium flow through voltage-gated calcium channels, SK channels can be activated by calcium flowing through NMDA receptors, which occurs after depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. Experiments using apamin have shown that specifically blocking SK channels can increase learning and long-term potentiation. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) causes the down-regulation of SK channels, which facilitates long-term potentiation. Increasing SK channel activity has the opposite effect and serves to impair learning. An increase in SK channel activity that occurs over time may be related to decreases in plasticity and memory that is seen with aging.\n\nThe dysfunction of potassium channels, including SK channels, is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder.\n\nSK channel blockers control the firing rate (the number of action potentials produced by a neuron in a given time) and the firing pattern (the way action potentials are allocated throughout time) through their production of m-AHP. SK channel activators decrease the firing rate and neuron sensitivity to excitatory stimuli, whereas SK channel blockers increase the firing rate and sensitivity to excitatory stimuli. This has important implications as to the function of dopaminergic neurons. For example, the amount of dopamine released by midbrain dopaminergic neurons is much higher when the frequency of firing increases than when they fire at a constant rate.\n\nSK channels are widely expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Multiple pharmacological techniques have been used to adjust SK affinity for calcium ions, thereby modulating the excitability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. Blockage of SK channels in vivo increases the firing rate of substantia nigra cells, which increases the amount of dopamine released from the synaptic terminals. When a large amount of dopamine accumulates in the cytosol, cell damage is induced due to the build-up of free radicals and damage to mitochondria. \nIn addition, techniques have been used to modulate SK channels in order to alter the dopamine phenotype of neurons. After the loss of TH+ (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive) substantia nigra compacta (SNc) neurons due to Parkinson’s-induced neurodegeneration, the number of these neurons can partially recover via a cell phenotype \"shift\" from TH- (tyrosine hydroxylase-negative) to TH+. The number of TH+ neurons can be altered by SK channel modulation; to be specific, the infusion of SK agonists into substantia nigra increases the number of TH+ neurons, whereas the infusion of SK antagonist decreases the number of TH+ neurons. The reason for this relationship between SK channels and TH expression may be due to neuroprotection against dopamine toxicity.\n\nBased on the two opposing roles of SK channels in the pathogenesis of PD, two contradictory methods have been suggested as therapeutic options for the improvement of PD symptoms:\nInhibition of SK channels\nFacilitation of SK channels\n\n", "id": "7704373", "categories": ["Ion channels", "Neurochemistry"], "title": "SK channel"}

Both highways are major east–west arteries in Morris County, New Jersey, and both are also lined with businesses and strip malls. Consequently Route 10 and US 46 experience heavy daily use, especially during the rush hours and on the weekends. This intersection is also the western terminus of Route 10.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation dismantled the Ledgewood Circle and reconfigured the two highways into a signalized T-intersection.\n\nBefore the circle was replaced, eastbound traffic on US 46 had to travel almost three-quarters of the way around the circle (while contending with traffic merging on to US 46 east and west from Route 10 west) in order to continue traveling on US 46 east.\n\nTravelers on U.S. Route 46 west wishing to travel on Route 10 east also had to go almost three-quarters of the way around the circle with the same merging traffic to reach Route 10 eastbound. There were traffic metering signals to provide gaps in traffic so that motorists could in theory move in and out of the circle safely, but these signals were overwhelmed by the volume of daily traffic entering and exiting the circle and were not effective.\n\nSpeeding around the circle was a hazard as well because the roadway was broad and the circle itself had a large diameter, allowing those who wished to travel at highway speeds (50–55 m.p.h.) to do so even though these speeds were significantly higher than the advisory speed of . This was the cause of many serious automobile accidents at the circle and another reason that the circle was replaced.\n\nSince the circle has been replaced, traffic approaching the former circle from the west while moving eastbound on U.S. Route 46 uses a new roadway that cuts through the middle of the former circle. Traffic must then use two dedicated left turn lanes governed by a signal to turn onto the original alignment of US 46 eastbound. Motorists wishing to travel on Route 10 eastbound maintain their travel lanes as those lanes become Route 10 eastbound. There is a signal for these lanes too, it stops eastbound traffic to allow for U-turns and westbound US 46 traffic to make a left turn onto eastbound Route 10.\n\nTraffic on US 46 westbound merges on to a new two lane roadway that occupies the former south-western roadway of the old circle. Traffic is governed by a signal which permits westbound US 46 traffic to merge on to the original divided highway that carried U.S. Route 46 west from the circle. Westbound travellers wishing to make a left turn onto Route 10 eastbound bear left from US.S. Route 46 westbound before this merge and use dedicated left turn lanes to make this move.\n\nTraffic on Route 10 westbound wishing to travel onto U.S. Route 46 eastbound merge right at the terminus of Route 10 and travel onto the original alignment of US 46 eastbound. There is no signal for this traffic and it must yield to on coming traffic. Travelers on Route 10 westbound wishing to use US 46 westbound maintain their travel lanes and merge onto the original US 46 westbound divided highway via a new roadway built through the middle of the old Ledgewood Circle. These lanes are governed by a traffic signal which allows for U-turns and U.S. Route 46 eastbound traffic to make a left turn to continue on US 46 eastbound.\n\nWhile the intersection is more heavily used than ever, traffic moves through much more safely and fluidly with this new alignment.\n\nA purple European beech tree grew in the former Ledgewood Circle. The tree was going to be destroyed during the replacement project, and as a result a grass-roots effort was taken up by local residents, led by Marion Whitescarver beginning in 1994, to save the tree. Philip Amsterdam, president of the Marsellis Warner Corp., who was hired to eliminate the Ledgewood Circle, offered to move the tree at no cost to the township. He was told that tree experts hired by the municipality said it wouldn't be feasible to move it, as they determined the tree sat in a morass of rocks and boulders, making it impossible to dig under. The New Jersey Department of Transportation agreed that the tree needed to come down.\n\nOn November 20, 1997, the tree was given a one-day reprieve to consider opposition to cutting down the tree. Construction was halted to consider Amsterdam's offer. The township was not persuaded to delay construction to remove the tree for replanting, which would have required colder temperatures to ensure a frozen root ball, and the tree was cut down on November 21, 1997.\n\n", "id": "7704526", "categories": ["Transportation in Morris County, New Jersey"], "title": "Ledgewood Circle"}

For the Paris premiere at the Opéra-Comique in 1911, Arbell and Clément repeated their roles, while the off-stage harpsichord in the minuet was played by Louis Diémer; the work on this occasion was paired in a double-bill with the premiere of Ravel's \"L'heure espagnole\".\n\nThe US public performance premiere of the work was presented by Amato Opera on 1 June 1985 with piano accompaniment and featured Caryn Lerner, James Landers and Roger Hayden in the principal roles.

The US West Coast premiere of the complete opera was presented in concert on 24 April 2013 at La Sierra University in Riverside, California featuring Cynthia Jansen, Kevin St. Clair and Aram Barsamian in the principal roles and Aaron Ball and Owen Lovejoy in comprimario roles. \n\nA concert revival of \"Thérèse\" on 21 July 2012 at the Festival de Radio France et Montpellier led to the release of a recording in April 2013. It featured Nora Gubisch, Charles Castronovo and Étienne Dupuis in the leading roles and was conducted by Alain Altinoglu.\n\nThe story takes place during the French Revolution and concerns Thérèse, who is torn between duty and affection, between her husband André Thorel, a Girondist, and her lover, the nobleman Armand de Clerval. Although she had decided to follow her lover into exile, when her husband is being led to execution she shouts \"Vive le roi!\" (Long live the king!) amid the frenzied crowd and is dragged to her husband's side and marched to the guillotine.\n\n\"October 1792. Clagny, near Versailles, France\" \n\nIn order to escape the wrath of the Revolution, the Marquis de Clerval, Armand, has fled France. His childhood friend, André, the son of the steward of the Clerval castle and now a Girondist revolutionary representative, has bought the chateau at an auction in order to be able to restore it to its rightful owner, Armand, after the Revolution. Unbeknownst to him, André’s young wife, Thérèse, and his friend Armand are in love. \n\nWatching the soldiers go off to war, Thérèse tells André that because of his political activities and duties as a Girondist representative, she is often left alone and fears that one day he may fall victim to the rage of the revolutionaries. She dreads returning to Paris and wishes they could get away from the fury of the revolution. Sensing that there might be something else that is making her so anxious, André asks his wife if her heart belongs to him entirely. Thérèse responds defensively that she would not be so ungrateful as to not love him: after all, she was a penniless orphan girl and thanks to him she is now the wife of a Girondist, a representative. Her duty, she tells him, is to ensure his happiness. André responds that she is the very essence of his happiness and that he wants nothing more than to live beside her. \n\nLeft alone, Thérèse muses that she venerates the good, kind and devoted André, but she is still in love with Armand. She recalls their last meeting – the previous summer, in that very place – where they bid each other farewell before he fled France.\n\nArmand returns to the chateau incognito and, alone with Thérèse, tries to rekindle their former love. She rebuffs him, telling him that she owes everything to her husband André, and her duty is to be by his side. Armand is almost recognized by the revolutionaries, but André vouches for him and offers him asylum under his roof.\n\n\"June 1793. Paris, France\"\n\nA few months later, the situation has become much worse. King Louis XVI has been executed five months prior and the Girondists are falling out of favor. Every day, more people are tried by the revolutionary court and sentenced to death. Thérèse bemoans the fact that they are stuck in the middle of this horror and wishes they could be far away. Sensing that she is concerned for Armand's safety, André tries to calm her down by saying that no one would suspect him, a representative, to be hiding a nobleman in his home. Yes, it is dangerous, he says, but he has a duty to protect his friend. He has secured a letter of safe conduct for Armand, with which he will be able to leave France and thus escape the Reign of Terror. André tells Thérèse that once Armand is safely out of the country, the two of them will be able to move out to the country, away from the horror currently surrounding them, and will live peacefully.\n\nAt this moment their friend Morel enters with terrible news: the growing wrath of the mob below has turned towards the Girondists. André feels that it is his duty to be alongside his comrades. Before leaving, he tells Armand that he may not be able to protect him for much longer and arranges for him to leave the country. He bids his friend and Thérèse farewell and goes down to the street to join the Girondists. Alone, Armand tries to persuade Thérèse to flee with him, to escape the horror of the Revolution and live happily together. After some hesitation, Thérèse finally agrees, but at this moment Morel enters and tells them that André has been arrested and is being led to the guillotine. Thérèse urges Armand to leave first and promises to meet him later and then flee the country. Left alone, she watches André as he is being led towards the guillotine. Torn between her love for Armand and her sense of duty towards André, she finally makes the decision to lean out the window and scream \"Long Live the King!\" The enraged revolutionaries rush in and arrest her; Thérèse takes her place next to her husband, as the two are led to their execution.\n\n\n\nNotes\n", "id": "7704629", "categories": ["Operas by Jules Massenet", "Operas", "French-language operas", "1907 operas", "Opera world premieres at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo"], "title": "Thérèse (opera)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7704646", "text": "Independence referendum\n\nAn independence referendum is a type of referendum in which the citizens of a territory decide whether the territory should become an independent sovereign state. An independence referendum that results in a vote for independence does not always ultimately result in independence.\n\nThe articles on specific referendums are linked with dates in the table on past referendums.\n\nAn independence referendum typically arises first after political success for nationalists of a territory. This could come in the election of politicians or parties with separatist policies, or from pressure from nationalist organisations.\n\nNegotiations for the terms of an independence referendum may take place between the nationalists and the government which exercises sovereignty over the territory. If terms can be agreed, then the independence referendum can be held with its result binding, and respected by the international community. Independence referendums can be held without the consent of governments, but their results are usually ignored by the international community.\n\nVarious issues can be discussed in negotiations, such as the date and timing of the poll, as well as voter eligibility. For these instances, common electoral practice is often widely used, although there can be deviations, as seen with the lowering of the voting age for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.\n\nOther issues to be negotiated include what question or questions should be on the ballot, and what the voting options could be. Independence referendums can offer options of greater autonomy as well as, or instead of, the status quo. They can also put forward other constitutional questions to ballot. The questions that referendums ask may be revised if parties involved in negotiations consider them to be too leading.\n\nNegotiations notably need to address what would make a result binding. For some independence referendums, a simple majority is required for one option. In other cases, a quota can be used, where a certain percentage of the vote or the electorate needs to be in favour of an option for it to be binding.\nSuccessful negotiations can be hard to achieve for nationalists, as governments can be reluctant to give up sovereignty. For example, nationalists planned to hold a referendum in Catalonia in 2014, but met opposition from the Spanish government. As a result, the referendum that went ahead was unofficial and non-binding.\n\nIn the event of a vote for independence, there may be negotiations on the terms of secession for the territory from the sovereign state. A declaration of independence for a new state is then made, and international recognition can follow, as well as membership of international organisations such as the United Nations. In cases involving non-binding referendums, this can lead to a unilateral declaration of independence, and therefore partially recognised or self-proclaimed states.\n\nIn the event of a vote against independence, there may still be a strong nationalist movement and calls for there to be a rerun of the independence referendum. For example, after two referendums in Quebec, the Parti Québécois has continued to raise the prospect of holding another referendum, and the Scottish National Party has said that there should be a repeat of the 2014 referendum if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.\n\n", "id": "7704646", "categories": ["Secession", "Independence referendums"], "title": "Independence referendum"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7704651", "text": "Bad quarto\n\nA bad quarto, in Shakespearean scholarship, is a quarto-sized printed edition of one of Shakespeare's plays that is considered to be unauthorised, and is theorised to have been pirated from a theatrical performance without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or, alternatively, written down later from memory by an actor or group of actors in the cast — the latter process has been termed \"memorial reconstruction\". Since the quarto derives from a performance, hence lacks a direct link to the author's original manuscript, the text would be expected to be \"bad\", i.e. to contain corruptions, abridgements and paraphrasings. \n\nIn contrast, a \"good quarto\" is considered to be a text that is authorised (literally, i.e. approved by the author), and which may have been printed from the author's manuscript (or a working draft thereof, known as his \"foul papers\"), or from a scribal copy or prompt copy derived from the manuscript or \"foul papers\".\n\nThe concept of the \"bad quarto\" originates in 1909, attributed to A W Pollard and W W Gregg. The theory defines as \"bad quartos\" the first quarto printings of \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Henry V\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" and \"Hamlet\", and seeks to explain why there are substantial textual differences between those quartos and the 1623 printing of the first folio edition of the plays.\n\nThe concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors, including Peele's \"The Battle of Alcazar\", Greene's \"Orlando Furioso\", and the collaborative script, \"Sir Thomas More\".\n\nThe theory has been accepted, studied and expanded by many scholars; but some modern scholars are challenging it and those, such as Eric Sams, consider the entire theory to be without foundation. Jonathan Bate states that \"late twentieth- and early twenty-first century scholars have begun to question the whole edifice\".\n\nThe concept of the \"bad quarto\" as a category of text was created by bibliographer Alfred W. Pollard in his book \"Shakespeare Folios and Quartos\" (1909). The idea came to him in his reading of the address by the editors, John Heminges and Henry Condell, which appears at the beginning of Shakespeare's First Folio and is titled, \"To the Great Variety of Readers\". Heminges and Condell refer to \"diuerse stolne, and surreptitious copies\" of the plays. Up until 1909, it had been thought that the reference to \"stolen\" copies was a general reference to all quarto editions of the plays.\n\nPollard, however, claimed that Heminges and Condell meant to refer only to \"bad\" quartos (as defined by himself), and Pollard listed as \"bad\" the first quartos of \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1597), \"Henry V\" (1600), \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" (1602), \"Hamlet\" (1603), and \"Pericles\" (1609). Pollard pointed out that not only do these five texts contain \"badness\" (namely significant textual errors and corruptions), but also that there is (legal) \"badness\" in those who pirated them.\n\nScholar W. W. Greg worked closely with Pollard and published the bad quarto of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", which is a work that is significant in the history of the \"bad quarto\" theory. Greg described how the text may have been copied, and he identified the actor who played the role of \"Host\" as the culprit. Greg called the process that the actor may have used \"memorial reconstruction\", a phrase later used by other scholars – meaning, literally, a reconstruction of it from memory.\n\nFor Shakespeare, the First Folio of 1623 is the crucial document; of the 36 plays contained in that collection, 18 have no other source. The other 18 plays had been printed in quarto form at least once between 1594 and 1623, but since the prefatory matter in the First Folio itself warns against earlier texts, which are termed \"stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors\", 18th- and 19th-century editors of Shakespeare tended to ignore the quarto texts and preferred the Folio.\n\nIt was at first suspected that the bad quarto texts represented shorthand reporting, a practice mentioned by Thomas Heywood in the Prologue to his 1605 play \"If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody\"; reporters would surreptitiously take down a play's text in shorthand during a performance and pirate a popular play for a competing interest. However, Greg and R.C.Rhodes argued instead for an alternative theory: since some of the minor speeches varied less (from the folio text) than those of major characters, their hypothesis was that the actors who played the minor roles had reconstructed the play texts from memory and thereby gave an accurate report of the parts that they themselves had memorized and played, but a less correct report of the other actors' parts.\n\nThe idea caught on among Shakespearean scholars. Peter Alexander added \"The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster\" (1594) and \"The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York\" (1595) – the earliest versions of \"Henry VI, Part 2\" and \"Henry VI, Part 3\" – to the roster of bad quartos; both had been previously thought to be source plays for Shakespeare's later versions of the same histories. The concept of the bad quarto was then extended to play texts by authors other than Shakespeare, and by the second half of the 20th century the idea was being widely adopted. However, by the end of the century dissenting views had been published, such as the work of Laurie Maguire, then at the University of Ottawa.\n\nVarious problems exist with the bad quarto hypothesis, particularly concerning the notion of memorial reconstruction. Furthermore, the hypothesis makes no allowance for changes to occur in the text across the enormous period between 1594 and 1623 (almost thirty years), from revisions by the author, abridgements for special circumstances, or natural evolution resulting from improvements to the text made by the actors in performance.\n\nFor some plays, critics seem undecided even as to what amounts to a \"bad\" quarto. The first quarto of \"Richard III\", for instance, is often now termed a bad quarto, \"even though it is an unusually 'good' bad quarto\". Alexander himself recognised that the idea of memorial reconstruction did not apply perfectly to the two plays he studied, which possessed problematical features that could not be explained, and in the end retreated to arguing, instead, that the quartos of the two early histories were \"partial\" memorial reconstructions.\n\nSome critics, including Eric Sams and Hardin Craig, dispute the entire concept of memorial reconstruction by pointing out that, unlike shorthand reporting, no reliable historical evidence exists that actors reconstructed plays from memory. They believe that memorial reconstruction is a modern fiction.\n\nIndividual scholars have sometimes preferred alternative explanations for variant texts, such as revision or abridgement by the author. Steven Urkowitz argued the hypothesis that \"King Lear\" is a revised work, in \"Shakespeare's Revision of \"King Lear\"\". Some scholars have argued that the more challenging plays of the Shakespearean canon, such as \"All's Well That Ends Well\" and \"Troilus and Cressida\", make sense as works that Shakespeare wrote in the earliest, rawest stage of his career and later revised with more sophisticated additions.\n\nSteven Roy Miller considers a revision hypothesis, in preference to a bad-quarto hypothesis, for \"The Taming of a Shrew\", the alternative version of Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew.\"\n\nRobert Burkhart's 1975 study \"Shakespeare's Bad Quartos: Deliberate Abridgements Designed for Performance by a Reduced Cast\" provides another alternative to the hypothesis of bad quartos as memorial reconstruction. Other studies have also questioned the \"orthodox view\" on bad quartos, as in David Farley-Hills's work on \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n\nNo account is taken in the \"bad quarto\" hypothesis that, throughout Shakespeare's working lifetime, stage plays for public performance were controlled by law, and could not be performed unless registered with, and granted a performance licence by, the Lord Chamberlain of England on behalf of the Monarch. This was a matter of public order, to control the content of plays with the aim of preventing the uttering of sedition or treason on the stage, such as had led, in the past, to rioting in the streets. This licensing system was strictly enforced, at least in London, near the heart of the Royal government; but it is impossible to reconcile it with the concept of \"pirate\" productions of any play being permitted; let alone with the idea that a hypothetical \"pirate\" theatre company would be allowed to print and sell its playscripts – the so-called \"bad quartos\" – without being forcibly put out of business by the militia. But failure to allow for the powers of the Chamberlain to close theatres, at the Monarch's will, really renders the essence of the \"bad quarto\" hypothesis defunct.\n\nIn 1996, Laurie Maguire of the Department of English at the University of Ottawa published a study of the concept of memorial reconstruction, based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the BBC TV Shakespeare series, broadcast in the early 1980s. \n\nShe found that actors typically add, drop or invert single words. But the larger-scale errors that would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance failed to appear in all but a few of the bad quartos. The study uncovered only limited circumstantial evidence suggestive of possible memorial reconstruction, in the bad quartos of \"Hamlet\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" and \"Pericles\".\n\nIn fact, according to Maguire, virtually all the so-called bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts, which \"merit our attention as valid texts in their own right\". This challenges the entire concept of \"bad quartos\" as pirated editions, mired in textual corruption; and presents them, rather, as earlier versions of the plays printed in the 1623 folio.\n\nThough the bad quarto concept originated in reference to Shakespearean texts, scholars have also applied it to non-Shakespearean play texts of the English Renaissance era. \n\nIn 1938, Leo Kirschbaum published \"A Census of Bad Quartos\" and included 20 play texts. Maguire's 1996 study examined 41 Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean editions that have been categorised as bad quartos, including the first editions of \"Arden of Feversham\", \"The Merry Devil of Edmonton\" and \"Fair Em\", plays of the Shakespeare Apocrypha; plus George Chapman's \"The Blind Beggar of Alexandria\"; Christopher Marlowe's \"Doctor Faustus\" and \"The Massacre at Paris\"; Part 1 of Heywood's \"If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody\"; and Beaumont and Fletcher's \"The Maid's Tragedy\".\n\n", "id": "7704651", "categories": ["English drama", "Bibliography", "Early editions of Shakespeare", "History of theatre"], "title": "Bad quarto"}

For the 2011-2012 school year, the Flint Community Schools had both middle schools, four elementary schools and one high school placed in the bottom 5% of all schools in the State of Michigan based on student achievement and attendance. The school district accommodated a total student population of about 30,000 students. It included two early childhood education centers, 18 elementary schools,and three secondary schools. Other buildings under its operation include the Genesee Area Skill Center,and 2 alternative education facilities. \n\nThe current mission statement of \"developing a community of learners who are prepared to live, work, and contribute to an ever changing society\" was developed by Walter Milton, who became Superintendent in 2005. Milton subsequently wrote a book entitled \"Me in the Making\" which included a chapter on his stormy tenure in Flint.\n\nIn November 2012, Superintendent Linda Thompson announced her retirement. Thompson, 57, is a Flint native who has worked 36 years with the district in several roles. She worked her way up the ranks from teacher to assistant principal, to principal before coming to the administration building and her eventual selection as superintendent. Linda Thompson, a native of Flint and graduate of the University of Michigan School of Education assumed the Superintendentship in 2008 and set about downsizing the District by closing schools. In late 2011 the District was found to be running a deficit of 3.7 million dollars by the accounting firm of Yeo and Yeo. In early 2012 the Flint School Board opted not to extend Superintendent Thompson's contract beyond the current year, citing the deficit and her previous effectiveness rating of 2.7 out a possible 4.0 points. Mrs. Thompson continued on a one-year contract, but in November 2012, on the heels of the discovery of an even larger budget deficit than the year before, she announced her retirement.\n\nIn December 2012, Lawrence Watkins Jr. was selected to serve as the Districts Interim Superintendent. Watkins was a longtime Flint School District employee. He graduated from Flint Central High School in 1971 and then graduated from Hillsdale College on a football scholarship in 1975. He's worked for the district, in some capacity, \"since I was 14 years of age,\" he has said. He was a locker room attendant in high school. After college, Watkins became varsity wrestling coach at Central High. In 1986, he became staff assistant for the district's office of pupil personnel services. He held several other positions in the administration office before retiring as director of pupil personnel services in 2012. He also served as director of school safety and security. Larry Watkins helped the Flint School District usher in a comprehensive educational plan, negotiate concessions from bargaining units and collaborate with community organizations to bring back the community education model that put Flint schools on the map. At the same time, Watkins saw Flint schools' deficit grow from $4 million to $21.9 million in a little over two years, thousands of students leave the district and numerous school buildings closed. On April 8, 2015, Mr. Watkins announced his retirement.\n\nIn August 2018, The Flint Community Schools selected Derrick Lopez, JD as its new Superintendent. One of his first acts was to secure funding from the Elon Musk Foundation in the amount of $480,350 to replace each water fountain in all of the Flint Community Schools with new water stations and two filtration systems: carbon filtration to remove the lead and ultraviolet filtration to remove other chemicals and soluble particulates. \nThe city of Flint's two oldest schools were Flint Central High School (formerly Flint City High School) and Flint Northern High School. Due to administrative decisions and budget cuts, Flint Central High School, founded in 1875, is not currently in operation; Flint Northern High School, founded in 1929, ranked in the bottom 1% of Michigan secondary schools and was also closed in 2013. Both institutions experienced relocation from their original sites.\n\nThe Genesee Area Skill Center (GASC Technology Center) in Mundy Township is a regional vocational-technical center in which 11th and 12th grade students throughout Genesee County can enroll in its career preparatory programs. There currently are 21 area High Schools that feed into the GASC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7704690", "categories": ["School districts in Michigan", "Education in Genesee County, Michigan"], "title": "Flint Community Schools"}

He served as 32nd Mayor of the city of Windsor from 1991 to 2003, and oversaw several major changes in the city's development.\n\nHurst was born in Windsor, and holds Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees from the University of Windsor. He practised law in private life, and unsuccessfully campaigned for the Windsor city council in 1982.\n\nHurst was elected to the Windsor City Council during a by-election in 1987, and was re-elected the 1988 municipal election. He represented the city's first ward. He was the only member of the Windsor council to vote against a financial bailout for the Windsor Symphony Orchestra in 1988, arguing that the orchestra was making itself financially unviable by spending too much money on new members.\n\nHurst increased his public profile in early 1991, when he emerged as a prominent opponent of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's decision to shut down its Windsor-area news department. He was quoted as saying, \"We're bombarded by American culture here and the CBC was something that really helped keep us Canadian\".\n\nHurst supported a relaxation of Canada's Sunday shopping laws for communities on the American border, arguing that this step would counter the effects of cross-border shopping on the local economy. He opposed a restrictive shopping law brought forward by the province of Ontario in early 1991.\n\nHurst was elected Mayor of Windsor in the 1991 municipal election, defeating local magazine publisher Jerry Woloschuk. The incumbent mayor, John Millson, did not seek re-election in order to spend more time with his family. Hurst renewed his opposition to Sunday shopping legislation after the election, and indicated that he might attempt to circumvent the law through legal means. He welcomed a 1992 ruling by the Ontario Municipal Board which allowed Sunday shopping in much of Windsor to promote tourism.\n\nHurst announced in 1992 that he would support the construction of a casino for Windsor, to be built by private enterprise and leased to the province. He argued that fifty million Americans lived within driving distance of the city, and that a casino would greatly improve the city's threatened economy. The plan was accepted by the provincial government of Bob Rae, and casino operations were opened to the public in 1994. Despite concerns about the long-term viability of a casino-centred economy, the project encountered relatively little organized opposition from the local community.\n\nOn opening night in 1994, Hurst proclaimed, \"These are momentous days for Windsor. Windsor is a city of hope.\" One year later, with the casino generating strong revenues, he said, \"It's changed the city forever.\" The permanent Casino Windsor building was opened in 1998.\n\nHurst also made several efforts to build a new arena in downtown Windsor, although these plans were beset with various delays. In the late 1990s, he championed a successful plan to construct an office tower complex for Chrysler Canada Ltd.\n\nHurst criticized the provincial government in April 1993 for cancelling a plan to relocate government jobs from Toronto to other communities. The Rae government had planned to decentralize the public sector after coming to office, but was forced to change its plans in the face of a serious recession.\n\nIn 1997, Hurst criticized the provincial government of Mike Harris (who succeeded Rae as premier in 1995) for introducing a bill to give the province extensive powers over public sector unions. He argued that it was unhelpful and unnecessarily confrontational. He also criticized the government's downloading of provincial services to the municipalities, arguing that the municipalities lost money from the arrangement. Hurst was himself asked to run for Harris's Progressive Conservative Party in a 1997 by-election, but declined.\n\nIn 1999, Hurst accused provincial cabinet minister Steve Gilchrist of putting himself in a conflict-of-interest situation by suggesting his personal lawyer as a government contact. Hurst says that he rejected the offer outright; Gilchrist denied having seriously made the offer. Hurst later indicated that he would not enforce the Harris government's laws against panhandling. In 2003, he commended Harris's successor Ernie Eves for promising to invest $625 million over five years in the auto sector.\n\nHurst also welcomed the return of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operations to Windsor in 1993.\n\nThe Windsor City Council voted to license escort services in 1996, as a means of providing legal protection for vulnerable sex-trade workers. Hurst opposed the licensing law, although he later acknowledged that it did not generate any complaints.\n\nIn 2002, two city employees were fired over allegations of misleading council over lease agreements with MFP Financial Services. One of the employees was also accused of accepting \"personal benefits\" from MFP. Hurst was strongly critical of the company's role in the matter.\n\nLater in the same year, Hurst threatened to call a state of emergency if the provincial and federal governments did not look into the issue of American-board trucks causing gridlock in the city. There were reports that urban gridlock was promoting an economic downturn for the community.\n\nHurst was re-elected in 1994, 1997 and 2000, each time by a significant margin.\n\nHurst supported a controversial Detroit River Tunnel Partnership plan near the end of his final term, and he was hired as chief executive officer of the partnership's Jobs Tunnel project in January 2004. He was fifty-three years old at the time. In 2011, Hurst was named a Justice of the Peace and works out of the Provincial Court in Windsor, Ontario.\n", "id": "7704706", "categories": ["Living people", "Mayors of Windsor, Ontario", "1950 births", "University of Windsor alumni"], "title": "Mike Hurst (politician)"}

Its success in Japan, as well as the success of its preceding singles \"Clock Strikes Ten\" and \"I Want You to Want Me\", paved the way for Cheap Trick's famous concerts at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo in April 1978 that were recorded for the group's most popular album \"Cheap Trick at Budokan\".

On 3 August 2009, ESPN Classic launched on Virgin Media channel 533 as a part of the XL pack, and in early 2011 video on demand content started to appear on the Virgin Media platform. On 14 August 2009, ESPN Classic launched on UPC Ireland channel 409 as a part of the Max package. It broadcast a range of archive sports coverage, with a large emphasis on football.\n\nOn 25 February 2013, BT Group agreed to acquire ESPN's UK and Ireland TV channels business, consisting of ESPN and ESPN America, the value of the deal was not disclosed, but BT is understood to have paid \"low tens of millions\". ESPN Classic, which was not part of the BT deal, ceased transmission on satellite across Europe, the Middle East and Africa at midnight on 1 August 2013.\n\nMuch of the channel's output was football. This included action from the Premier League, FA Cup matches, European Cup, European Cup Winners Cup and League Cup finals and some England games. ESPN Classic also showed games from the FIFA World Cup following a multi-year deal to show 150 classic FIFA World Cup matches from 1930 to 2006. Though most coverage on the channel was from the colour era, it had shown original black-and-white footage of European Cup finals going back as far as 1959.\n\nA significant proportion of the football action on ESPN Classic was archive ITV football coverage, including matches covered by regional ITV companies. However much of the football seen on the channel was not shown with the original commentary. Instead, many games, especially the Premier League and FA Cup games, tended to feature commentary dubbed on more recently by Jon Champion and Paul Dempsey, or commentary by Sky Sports broadcasters such as Martin Tyler and Alan Parry which seemed to be from the international feed of the time. Similarly, the footage from games where commentary was later added did not include original on-screen captions, with ESPN adding captions themselves. Some 1960s European Cup finals also had a new commentary dubbed on by Tony Jones. \n\nThe channel also showed some rugby union international matches, including action from the Rugby World Cup, as well as past matches from the rugby union Premiership. Other sports featured included cricket, ESPN-produced vintage boxing matches, The Ultimate Fighter and more recently, action from American sports to complement the live American sports action which was broadcast on ESPN and ESPN America. \n\nIn addition to the programmes mentioned above, ESPN Classic had made a variety of other programmes. These included \"Sports Years\" as well as many football compilation programmes. In addition, to mark the 30th anniversary of ESPN, the channel showed the ESPN Films' \"30 for 30\" series.\n\nESPN Classic regularly repeated the sporting action that it showed on the channel with the same material often being shown time and time again. Some of the action, especially ESPN-produced programmes and series, had been broadcast on the channel on dozens of different occasions.\n\nDuring the first three years of the channel sporting action from the BBC was featured extensively. However, this deal expired in mid 2009 and was seemingly not renewed as for the next eighteen months the channel did not feature any sport produced by the BBC. Therefore, sports such as rugby league, golf, athletics, darts and snooker were not shown on the channel nor were events such as domestic cricket prior to 1999 (the year that the BBC lost the rights to show live cricket), Wimbledon tennis, the Olympic Games and football coverage to which the BBC had the exclusive rights, which had included showings of 1970s and 1980s editions of Match of the Day under the title of \"The Dead Good Match\" with the opening and closing titles removed, and some editions were truncated, with only one of the matches covered in a particular programme being shown. One exception had been BBC-produced coverage of rugby union's Five Nations tournament shown during the 2011 Six Nations Championship. \n\nIn March 2011, a new deal between ESPN and the BBC was signed which provided ESPN Classic with access to around 80 hours of footage. However, this was far less than under the previous agreement which had given the channel access to around 630 hours. The new deal meant that previous ESPN-produced programmes based on the BBC archive, such as the darts series \"Bellies and Bullseyes\", were once again shown on the channel along with new programmes, such as athletics series \"Solid Gold - Team GB\" and other one-off programmes such as a compilation of top Grand Nationals. This new deal with BBC Sport coincided with a new look for the channel, the first new look since ESPN UK launched in summer 2009.\n\nESPN Classic occasionally showed live action when two events to which ESPN has the rights took place at the same time. The first live sport that the channel showed was two UEFA Europa League matches, on 29 September and 20 October 2011. The first of the two games was Maribor and Birmingham. \n\nOn 9 January 2012, the channel broadcast the third evening of the BDO World Darts Championship because the main channel was showing a third round match from the FA Cup. This happened again a year later when for the same reason ESPN Classic again showed the third evening's action.\n\nOn 5 May 2012, ESPN Classic broadcast two live events - the final day of rugby union's Premiership league season and a football match from Serie A. This was due to the main channel showing live coverage of the FA Cup Final.\n\nOn 1 September 2012, ESPN Classic showed a live rugby union match from the Aviva Premiership because the main network was broadcasting its weekly match from football's Premier League. The same happened two weeks later although the clash this time was due to the main channel showing the Scottish Premier League.\n\nOn 20 and 22 September 2012, ESPN Classic showed live coverage of the European Darts Championship because the main channel was showing the\nUEFA Europa League and the Aviva Premiership respectively. The following day (Sunday 23rd) ESPN swapped its coverage with the darts being shown on the main channel with much of its traditional Sunday fare of European league football plus another Aviva Premiership match airing on Classic.\n\nOn 4 May 2013, ESPN Classic was used to provide coverage of a second game from the final set of league matches of the 2012–13 Aviva Premiership season.\n\n\n", "id": "7704801", "categories": ["Television channels and stations disestablished in 2013", "Defunct television channels in Italy", "Television channels in Belgium", "2013 disestablishments in Italy", "Sports television in Italy", "Sports television in Poland", "ESPN media outlets", "Sports television channels in the United Kingdom", "Television channels in the United Kingdom", "Television channels and stations established in 2002", "Defunct television channels in the Netherlands", "Television channels in Flanders", "Italian-language television stations", "2002 establishments in Italy"], "title": "ESPN Classic (European TV channel)"}

It was discovered and mapped for the first time in 1856 by Jacob de Córdova, who found the river while surveying for the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad Company; it was named after Texas Governor Elisha M. Pease. In December 1860, the Texas Rangers recaptured Cynthia Ann Parker and her daughter from the Comanche Indians at an engagement along the river.\n\nThe river begins northeast of Paducah in northern Cottle County and runs eastward for to its mouth on the Red River northeast of Vernon. Its course flows through \"flood-prone flat terrain with local shallow depressions, surfaced by sandy and clay loams\"; part of it forms the county line between Hardeman and Foard counties.\n\nThe river has three main branches, the North Pease, Middle Pease, and Tongue (or South Pease) rivers; the beginning of the main river is variously given as where all three branches come together, or where only the North and Middle Pease Rivers intersect. Satellite and topographical imagery, however, clearly shows that the Tongue River empties into the Middle Pease before the latter's meeting with the North Pease.\n\nThe North Pease rises southeast of Cedar Hill on the Caprock Escarpment in eastern Floyd County and runs through Motley, Hall and Cottle before meeting the Middle Pease River. It begins at and descends over , cutting a wide, sandy bed through mostly flat terrain; most of the area through which it passes is remote ranchland.\n\nThe Middle Pease river rises northwest of Matador at the confluence of Mott and Boggy Creeks in western Motley County; it flows about for in an eastward direction before joining the North Pease in northeastern Cottle County. It runs through flat, isolated ranch territory; the only settlement ever established on its banks was the now-ghost of Tee Pee City. The state has established a region called the Matador Wildlife Management area along its course in northwestern Cottle County.\n\nThe Tongue River, or South Pease River, was named allegedly named for the Black Tongue, a 19th-century disease that killed many area buffalo. It rises west of Roaring Springs in southwestern Motley County and flows east and northeast through rugged ranch- and canyonland. The geographic feature of Roaring Spring (not to be confused with the town), downstream from the river's source, was a popular gathering place for Indians, cowboys, and others. A ranch club is now located near the spring, where State Highway 70 crosses the river.\n\n\n", "id": "7704828", "categories": ["Rivers of Texas", "Rivers of Oklahoma"], "title": "Pease River"}

It is distributed through much of the countryside of Córdoba and Seville, and is concentrated particularly in the area of Utrera, which is considered the heartland of the breed. In 2009 the population was estimated at 10,000 birds.\n\nA very different type of Andalusian, more intensely blue and with blue-laced plumage, was created in England from birds imported from Andalusia through selective breeding and cross-breeding with birds of other breeds.\n\nThere is little information on the early history of the Andalusian. Blue chickens from Andalusia were imported to England no later than 1851. The creation of the \"international\" type of Andalusian, with blue-laced plumage, is attributed to the English, whether in Andalusia or in Britain. Two breeders in particular are thought to have started this process, which took many years: one named Coles, from Fareham, Hampshire, and a certain John Taylor of Shepherd's Bush, in west London. Another claimant was Augusta Legge who was the countess of Dartmouth. Andalusians were shown at Baker Street, London, in January 1853; they were not included in the original \"Standard of Excellence\" in 1865.\n\nAndalusians reached the United States in about 1850–55, and were included in the first edition of the \"Standard of Perfection\" of the American Poultry Association in 1874. The breed arrived in South America in 1870, and was first shown in Germany in the same year. A bantam was created in the 1880s.\n\nThe slate-blue plumage of the Andalusian is caused by a dilution gene, which, in combination with the E gene for black plumage, produces partial dilution of the melanin which gives the black colour. Not all Andalusians are blue: birds with two copies of the gene have near-total dilution, and are off-white; birds with no copies have no dilution, and are black; those with one copy have partial dilution, and are blue. Blue birds occur, in Mendelian proportion, twice as often as each of the other colours. All are present in the population.\n\nThe earlobes of the Andalusian are smooth, white, and almond-shaped; the crest is single and of medium size, with five well-defined points. The skin is white and the legs and feet are black.\n\nAndaluza Azul hens lay about 165 white eggs per year; eggs weigh Blue-bred white hens lay the largest eggs.\n", "id": "7704848", "categories": ["Conservation Priority Breeds of the Livestock Conservancy", "Animal breeds on the RBST Watchlist", "Chicken breeds originating in Spain", "Animal breeds on the GEH Red List"], "title": "Andalusian chicken"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7704996", "text": "Steve Johnson and Kayla Brady\n\nSteve \"Patch\" Earl Johnson and Dr. Kayla Caroline Brady are a supercouple on the American soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\". Steve is portrayed by Stephen Nichols and Kayla is portrayed by Mary Beth Evans. On the Internet message boards[5] the couple is often referred to by the portmanteau \"Stayla\" (for Steve and Kayla). The couple was initially popular from 1986 through 1990 until the \"death\" of Steve. Both characters have recently returned: after Steve being presumed dead for 16 years, Steve returned to the show on June 9, 2006; Kayla returned on June 12, 2006. Steve and Kayla were dropped off canvas in February 2009. Kayla returned in December 2011. In August 2015, Steve returned to Salem, and the couple reunited soon after\n\nSteve Johnson was a former Merchant Marine who came to Salem working as a mercenary. He had a vendetta against his former best friend, Bo Brady (Kayla's brother) who had gouged out his eye during a fight long ago. His bad boy image and criminal actions were no match for the beautiful good girl, Kayla Brady. One night, he rescued her from a street gang and left a note with his number on her car, and eventually, the two fell in love.\n\nKayla pushed Steve away, but he was undeterred. He kept trying to convince her that they were meant to be together. Kayla's family were opposed to the pairing, most especially Bo Brady, who believed Steve to be dangerous. Steve received an incredible shock when his sister came to town. Adrienne had been born after Steve's mother had brought Steve and baby Billy to an orphanage. Steve had been 5, Billy had been a young baby. Jo Johnson (Steve's mother) was afraid her husband Duke would kill the children (or vice versa) due to Duke's extremely violent nature. Steve wanted nothing to do with Adrienne or Jo, but deep down, he was yearning for the mother he had loved and hoped to see again.\n\nDuke ended up raping his virgin daughter, Adrienne, when she refused to tell him where to find her mother. She shot him in self-defense when he staggered over to her to do it again, and then she blocked out the memory of the rape and the killing. Steve tried to take the blame and developed a strong protectiveness towards his sister. Adrienne remembered what had happened just in time, during the trial, and Steve was exonerated. He started to push Kayla even further away, blaming her at first for not letting him kill Duke when he had had a chance (before the rape) and then fearing that he would be just like Duke, after his mother angrily told her children that Duke hadn't always been so bad when they confronted her on her decision to ever hook up with a man like him. She told Steve that Steve reminded her of Duke in many ways, not realizing how painful those words would be.\n\nTheir relationship would be challenged by the news that Steve had a wife. While taken aback and hurt by the news, Kayla continued the relationship. Then Kayla's boyfriend, Jack, shows up. Jack is madly in lovely with Kayla but Kayla does not return the feelings. Jack hopefully pursued Kayla because he thought eventually he would win her over. The Deveraux Family hired Kayla to be Jack's private nurse when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease and quite ill. Steve learned the truth that Jack was his own brother, Billy. When he did, he shunned Kayla, hoping she would end up with Jack so his brother would have someone special with whom to spend his seemingly final days. Believing Steve was no longer interested in her, Kayla accepted a marriage proposal from Jack.\n\nJack (now played by Matthew Ashford) recovered, but Kayla rebuffed every one of his attempts to consummate the marriage, unable to let her love for Steve go. Jack assumed Kayla was just nervous because they didn't know each other all that well. He knew she didn't love him, suspected that there were still feelings between Steve and Kayla, but he still remained hopeful that she would someday love him.\n\nMonths later, Steve discovered Kayla was being poisoned. Suspecting it to be someone in the Deveraux house, and heartbroken that it could be his baby brother, he kidnapped her and the two *almost made love. They carried on their affair in secret. Kayla wanted to get out of her marriage, but Jo and Steve begged her to wait until Jack's political election had passed. On New Year's Eve/Day, Jack planned a romantic evening for them, and Kayla feigned illness so she and Steve could be together that night. A photographer snapped pictures of them kissing on New Year's Eve, while at the same time, a disconsolate Jack was searching for his wife at a party to do the new years countdown together. Worried what they were doing was wrong, the two said a heartfelt goodbye, something they would do over and over again.\n\nA few weeks later, Jack won the political election and an unscrupulous reporter gave him the compromising pictures, intending to blackmail him. Enraged by her behavior and believing that Kayla and Steve had deliberately set out to hurt him, Jack confronted Kayla, and angrily raped her. Steve discovered this, fought his brother, and nearly killed him when Jack fell off the roof where they were fighting. In the aftermath, as Jack suffered from failing kidneys, Steve donated one of his own to save his brother's life. Jack resented - and even harassed - Steve and Kayla, but the revelation that he was Steve's brother and that his own father Harper had been a serial killer (who had tried to poison Kayla) would change his life, eventually for the better.\n\nSteve saved Kayla from Harper once more, but Kayla ended up losing her ability to speak following surgery to repair her hearing. When Jack discovered that Kayla was deaf and that part of the reason she was deaf was the stresses in her life, including his own violent behavior, he sadly granted her a divorce.\n\nSteve learned to use sign language to communicate with her. Kayla's speech returned on her wedding day when she said \"I do\" to marrying Steve.\n\nA couple of years later, Steve's supposedly dead wife Marina resurfaced. She wanted to get back together with Steve, but instead asked for his help in finding a special key. A pregnant Kayla thought it was the best thing to do in the hopes Marina would grant Steve a divorce so they could truly be married. Marina had every intent of rekindling things with Steve, but Jack, who was now well on his way to reforming did his level best to bring Steve and Kayla back together, despite Steve and Kayla's insistence that he stay away from them.\n\nAfter going all the way to Italy and back, Marina ended up dead and Kayla was accused of the murder. Due to doctored videotape evidence, Kayla was sentenced to prison for ten years. She gave birth to a daughter, Stephanie, who Steve would raise while Kayla was in prison. However, a deranged nanny kidnapped Stephanie. Kayla escaped prison and she and Steve followed the kidnapper to Australia where, along with Bo and Hope, they were able to recover their baby. Now a newspaper man, Jack Deveraux worked with Jennifer Horton (his employee and future wife) to help push public opinion Kayla's way and help find out who really killed Marina. The evidence against Kayla was soon discovered to be a fraud when Isabella, Marina's sister remembered that she had killed her sister during a violent altercation and Kayla was allowed to return to Salem, a free woman.\n\nSteve and Kayla were married again in 1990, this time with Jack Deveraux as best man. The incident with Marina had changed his relationship with Steve and Kayla and Steve was tentatively trying to welcome his brother into his life. Kayla, while always uncomfortable around Jack, tried to make peace with their past and allow the relationship to grow between the brothers.\n\nTragedy would strike, however, when Steve was caught in an explosion aboard Bo Brady's boat. It was no accident; the explosion was meant to kill Bo and was planned by the evil oil baron Lawrence Alamain. Steve survived the blast, but because he thought Steve had evidence against him, Lawrence had Steve's IV poisoned. With a grief-stricken Kayla at his side, Steve died. However, an empty coffin was buried in his grave.\n\nPresumed dead after his car went into a river, Jack Deveraux was on his deathbed in a hospice. He was awaiting death, and refusing to let his wife Jennifer, daughter Abigail and mother Jo know he was still alive, hoping to spare them the agony of losing him (yet again, as he has 'died' more than once). A caring orderly tried to see if he wanted anything to eat or drink and a delirious Jack was shocked to see that it was his brother Steve Johnson! Jack could not believe his eyes.\n\nSteve believed himself to be a man by the name of Nick Stockton, but a DNA test proved otherwise. Intrigued by the possibilities, and driven by his brother's earnest pleadings that he return home, he convinced Jack to return home as well.\n\nOn the day of Jennifer's wedding to Frankie Brady, Steve and Jack arrived. Everyone was shocked when Jack interrupted the ceremony. Meanwhile, overwhelmed by the pain of returning to Salem where she had enjoyed such a short time of joy with Steve, Kayla was crying at Steve's graveside at the cemetery at the church, unable to sit through the wedding without breaking down.\n\nSuddenly, Steve approached her from behind, asking her if she was okay. The shock of seeing her long lost love caused Kayla to faint, but when she awoke, her wildest dreams were confirmed: Steve has returned.\n\nKayla was overjoyed and has tried not to pressure Steve, who is clearly suffering from amnesia. He has shared the memories he does have, but continually tells Kayla he has no memory of her. Kayla and Steve have spent a lot of time together trying to stir up memories, she explained to him why the sky was blue and the meaning of e=mc2, but upon a visit to Cincinnati, Ohio - Nick Stockton's old stomping grounds - it appeared as though Steve was giving up on those missing memories and on Kayla. She returned to Salem, and Steve would almost immediately follow her. Steve's daughter Stephanie also proved to be a great draw for him, as the young woman joyfully welcomed her thought-dead father into her life.\n\nSteve began to push Kayla away again, trying instead to make a love connection with Billie Reed whom he thought to be more like himself than the classy Dr. Kayla Brady. At the same time, his brother Jack made a complete recovery and left with wife and son to head up the London \"Spectator\" news office. Jack begged his brother to give his love with Kayla a chance, telling him that Kayla and Steve were meant to be together, which was full circle from the times he tried to tear them apart. Having no memories of his darker past with his brother, Steve was moved and affected by the younger man's words and outpouring of brotherly affection, but he still could not make the move towards a life with Kayla.\n\nHis daughter roundly scolded him for bringing Billie with him to watch her race (she races cars) and Steve blamed himself when Stephanie was critically injured during the race. Tearfully at her bedside, he had a flashback to holding her as a baby. He still doesn't remember Kayla, but now he remembers Stephanie and he's terrified of how much it hurts to love her, especially as she lies near deaths door.\n\nSteve and Kayla were poisoned by a biotoxin a month later, in November 2006. Steve recovered, but Kayla, hovering near death, fell into a coma. Steve pretended to get his memory back (with the help of notes of his history with Kayla, provided by Bo and Hope) to give her the will to carry on; it worked, and Kayla woke up, weak but responsive. Before John and Marlena could get back from Canada with the antidote for Kayla, she flatlined, and Steve became hysterical; he lifted her up and gave her a long kiss, and miraculously, her heart started to beat again. John and Marlena got to the hospital, the antidote was administered, and Kayla began to recover.\n\nAfter Kayla was released from the hospital, Steve remained by her side, but was distant; because of her fragile, still-recovering state, he was hesitant to tell her that his memory had not really returned. However, Kayla suspected the truth, as he was distant. To find out for certain, she asked Steve to take a trip with her to the bungalow where they had hid from Victor Kiriakis nearly two decades earlier; she wanted to 'test' his memory there. Steve, not knowing that Kayla suspected the truth, reluctantly agreed.\n\nOnce at the bungalow, Steve decided to tell Kayla the truth: his memory did not return— and he remembered a life with a separate family, a different wife and daughter. However, he cared about Kayla and he was just determined to keep Kayla alive, and wanted to give her the will to live. Heartbroken but strong, Kayla surprised Steve by telling him that she had already knew that this was the case. She excused herself, going to another room to silently cry. Steve promptly fell asleep on the bed, and began to have flashes of memories and dreams of Kayla. Waking up in the middle of a dream, he thought that he and Kayla were on the run from Victor Kiriakis, something that had happened nearly 20 years prior. Entering the room Kayla was in, he frantically vowed to protect her, as Kayla, shocked, didn't understand what was going on. The flashes of memory became more intense, and Steve, with Kayla holding on to him in an attempt to snap him out of his erratic state, fell; catching his breath, he realized Kayla could be the love of his life, his memory had returned, telling Kayla tearfully, \"I remember loving you!\"\n\nKayla was skeptical, but Steve, at first, was oblivious; he was so overjoyed at having his memory back, trying to tell her every memory at once. He soon noticed that she was crying, and was shocked, asking her what was wrong. Kayla replied that she didn't know if she could believe that he had really gotten his memory back, especially not after how he had previously pretended to remember her. Horrified, Steve grabbed her and assured her that he, Steven Earl Johnson, her \"one-eyed tomcat\" was indeed back. Overcome, Kayla ran out of the bungalow, crying, with Steve chasing her. Coming back, she nearly fainted—still recovering from the biotoxin poisoning—and he caught her, holding her close and assuring her that everything would be fine.\n\nAfter more desperate pleas from Steve to believe in him, and after he signed 'courage' to her as he did on their wedding day, Kayla relented; they reunited passionately.\n\nOver the next year, 2007, Steve and Kayla would overcome the consequences of Steve's brainwashing by Stefano DiMera, who had used him as a pawn. Kayla deprogrammed him after several months of pain and terror.\n\nThat summer, Steve would act as a go-between for the DiMera family and the Bradys, as he attempted to discover what the DiMeras were up to by infiltrating their mansion as an undercover agent. Also around this time, Kayla began thinking about adopting a child so she and Steve could experience raising one together. Kayla was working at the hospital when she discovered an abandoned baby boy there, and instantly fell in love with him. With some convincing, Steve agreed that they would become the foster parents of the baby boy, nicknamed \"Pocket\" by Kayla. After a couple of months, however, Pocket began getting sick, and had to be hospitalized. During this time, Philip Kiriakis discovered he had a son, an in-vitro baby with Mimi Lockhart. Steve, Kayla, and Philip all learned that Pocket was really Philip and Mimi's son, whose real name was Tyler, and who had been abandoned by the surrogate who gave birth to him. In the end, a young couple who had been caring for the baby after he was taken away from Steve and Kayla expressed a desire to adopt him, and Steve and Kayla, though heartbroken to lose the little boy, agreed that the child would be well off with the adoptive parents, as did Philip.\n\nSteve and Kayla then had to deal with the rape of their daughter, Stephanie, by Ford Decker, who afterwards died in an accidental fall.\n\nIn February 2008, Kayla learned that she was pregnant with the couple's second child.\n\nOn May 16, 2008, in an emotionally charged episode, Kayla gave birth to her and Steve's baby boy, who arrived three months prematurely, and was not breathing at birth; he was immediately transported to the NICU of Salem University Hospital. Devastated yet hopeful, his parents are now dealing with the aftermath. The baby boy has been named Joseph, to be known as 'Joe' Johnson.\n\nSteve and Kayla were part of a growing \"supercouple\" phenomenon on \"Days of our Lives\", largely starting after Luke Spencer and Laura Webber from \"General Hospital\" took the daytime world by storm and enthralled viewers with their adventurous and romantic storylines. Steve and Kayla were a classic good girl/bad boy story, with Steve battling his inner demons, stemming from the resentment he felt at being left to live in an orphanage, his abusive parents, and his general disdain for any type of romantic relationship. In contrast, Kayla had been raised in a happy, content family, and grew up with loving parents and siblings. At times, Steve felt it impossible for them to really have anything in common. However, the show stuck by the couple and their pairing was and remains one of the most successful partnerships in DAYS history.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7705039", "text": "Ando Masahashi\n\nJames Kyson, who portrays Ando, had to audition several times for the role, and recounted the entire process of his being selected in an interview with BuddyTV:\n\nKyson explained that he, a Korean American, had to learn the Japanese language from scratch with the aid of a coach because the role was written as Japanese. As Japanese was grammatically similar to Korean, which he was already fluent in, he did not find the process difficult.\n\nIn a discussion about his characters presence in Season 1, Kyson commented on how he felt the relationship between Hiro and Ando had become that of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo respectively, and talked about Ando's progression as a character:\n\nHe also mentioned his belief that Ando embodied the “everyman,” and that Hiro's assertion that “You don’t have to have superpowers to be a hero” was true of the character.\n\nIn an interview with \"TV Guide,\" Kyson spoke about the character in Season 2, and his promotion from a recurring character to series regular. He also spoke about the possibility of Ando obtaining a power, saying that, “I fully embrace him as an ordinary mortal,” but mentioned that, “I do want to get in the mix a little bit. To get in there and do some action.”\n\nRegarding Season 3, Kyson expressed the belief that Ando's role would be important, and that his background story would be explored:\n\nAndo first appeared to the audience as a friend of \"Heroes\" protagonist Hiro Nakamura, watching an internet video of online stripper Niki Sanders. Ando did not believe that Hiro could manipulate space and time, even after Hiro teleported into the women's bathroom of a bar. After the incident, he told Hiro to stop trying to be different and accept his lot in life.\nWhen Hiro returned from the future in \"One Giant Leap,\" he convinced Ando of his powers and Ando then traveled with Hiro to America to prevent the explosion from occurring.\nFollowing an issue of a “9th Wonders!” comic book they went to Las Vegas and visited a casino, where Hiro used his powers to cheat at gambling. After being thrown out, they were attacked by some men that lost money to them.\nThey argued in the next episode and Ando left Hiro to find Niki Sanders at her home, where he was apprehended by a group of police. He then reunited with Hiro in their journey to find Isaac Mendez.\n\nAfter contacting Peter Petrelli, Ando and Hiro learnt about the latters future self. They were again confronted by the men they defeated in the poker game, and forced to play another round. Ando panicked during the game and rushed with Hiro to the bathroom. While in there, their opponents were killed and they fled. Ando later consoled Hiro, telling him he could perhaps change their deaths by time travel after their mission. While on the road, they happened upon a burning car, and helped D.L. Hawkins save the life of the passengers. Ando called the police, which forced D.L. to flee with his son Micah. Further along in their journey they stopped at a Diner in Odessa, Texas, where they met a waitress named Charlie Andrews, who had the ability to instantly memorize things. When Charlie was killed in the storage room of the diner by an unknown man Hiro, despite Ando's pleading, traveled back in time to prevent her death. He failed to return within five seconds as he promised, leaving Ando alone. Later in the diner, Ando noticed a picture of Charlie and Hiro together, taken six months ago, and realized Hiro had traveled back there. Peter Petrelli called, and later met Ando at the diner. Ando protested against Peter going to find “the cheerleader” without the presence of someone with abilities, but Peter left.\n\nEventually, Hiro returned, having failed to save Charlie, and they continued onwards to Union Wells High School . When it became clear they had arrived too late, Hiro felt the world was doomed. As they left, they received a phone call from Isaac Mendez, whom they met back at the diner, with Isaac telling them of his prophetic paintings. Later, he painted another of Hiro. In “Godsend,” Ando and Hiro finally arrived at New York, and visited the Museum of Natural History looking for a sword like the one in Isaac's painting, and they find the Blade of Takezo Kensei, a legendary samurai. They stole it, but it transpired that the sword was a replica, with the original belonging to a Mr. Linderman. They went to Isaac's loft seeking his help, and met Simone Deveaux, who told them that Linderman resided in Las Vegas. When Ando and Hiro were kidnapped and brought to Hiro's father in “The Fix”, Ando became attracted to Hiro's sister, Kimiko in the next episode. In “Run!”, Ando became infatuated with a woman named Hope, who convinced Ando to obtain a bag of hers from her ‘ex-boyfriend’. When he returned with it, Hope convinces Ando to give her a ride. Hiro, who had been locked up by Hope, pursued them with her ‘ex-boyfriend’, a gaming commission officer. This led to a shoot-out between Hope and the officer, and afterwards, Hiro told Ando to go home. Ando nonetheless followed Hiro, and saved him from arrest when Hiro was discovered stealing Takezo Kensei's sword from Linderman's casino. Hiro teleported them away. In “.07%,” it is revealed to the audience that Hiro has teleported them both five years into the future, were they encounter Hiro's future self. With “Five Years Gone,” New York has been devastated by the atomic explosion predicted by Isaac. When Hiro is captured by Homeland Security, Ando and Future Hiro escaped, and plotted to free him so he and Ando could return to their time and stop the bomb. Ando learned from Future Peter that he was killed in the explosion. They eventually manage to free Hiro, but Future Hiro was killed by Matt Parkman. As he died, he handed to Ando a page of a “9th Wonders!” comic book.\n\nAndo and Hiro returned to the present, and traveled to Isaac's loft to consult him. They found him dead, killed by Sylar, and hid as the killer detected them. They escaped him and then followed him to his mother's. Hiro did not want to kill Sylar, but Ando showed Hiro the “9th Wonders!” comic page which shows him dead. Hiro unsuccessfully attempts to kill Sylar. He and Ando teleport to safety, where they discovered that the sword has been broken. They try to have the sword repaired, and Ando and Hiro encountered Hiro's father once more. Kaito and Hiro spoke alone, and Ando, impatient, decided to seek out and kill Sylar himself. In the season finale, Ando went to Isaac's loft and found Sylar. The superhuman villain overpowered him and prepared to kill him. Ando dropped the “9th Wonders!” comic book in the process, revealing to Sylar that Hiro would kill him. When he started to kill Ando, Hiro arrived and teleported himself and Ando to the offices of Yamagato industries back in Tokyo, where their journey started. Hiro gives Ando Kensei's sword, promised to return, before he finally teleported to Kirby Plaza to kill Sylar with Ando's sword.\n\nIn the graphic novel \"Heroism is Found in the Heart,\" after Hiro was teleported back to Japan, Ando was reassigned by Kaito Nakamura to Hiro's former position. Ando became infatuated with Kimiko Nakamura and sought her affections. One night, he walked her home and they were confronted by a group of bikers. Ando learned that the leader, Fukazawa, was also pursuing Kimiko. Ando and Kimiko ran, but were eventually cornered. Ando promised to protect Kimiko and confronted the gang. When they ran away, Ando kissed Kimiko. Neither were aware that Kaito had scared the pursuers away.\n\nIn \"Four Months Later...,\" Ando has returned to New York City following Hiro's disappearance, waiting for his friend's return with Kaito Nakamura. Kaito receives a death threat and Ando leaves to get a sword for protection. He returns to see Kaito killed by Adam Monroe, though Ando does not see the killer's face.\n\nFollowing Kaito's death, Ando is questioned by Matt Parkman about the incident, but, besides telling him the meaning of the helix symbol, Ando is unable to answer his questions. In the episode \"Kindred,\" Ando discovers that Hiro has left messages for him, stored within the hilt of Takezo Kensei's sword. The messages, written while he was in the year 1671, detail Hiro's adventures with Takezo Kensei.\n\nHiro returns in \"Out of Time,\" to Ando's delight. While both are happy about the reunion, Ando sorrowfully tells Hiro about his father's death. At Kaito's funeral, Ando is dismayed at Hiro's decision to go back and time to save his father, but is unable to dissuade him. However, Hiro realizes that Ando is right and does not change history, instead using the opportunity to discover that Adam Monroe, who he knows as Takezo Kensei, was responsible. Hiro makes it his mission to stop Adam and confronts him at the Primatech Paper Facility. He returns to Ando with the assurance that Adam can never hurt anyone again.\n\nIn \"The Second Coming,\" Hiro, resigned to working in his fathers office at Yamagato Industries, told Ando that he was bored without a quest. Suddenly Kaito's lawyer turned up with a recorded message from Kaito to Hiro. It instructed him to guard the contents of a safe, and never open it. Hiro curiously opened the safe and found one half of a molecular formula, which was stolen by an unidentified person with the ability of super speed. When Hiro travelled to the future to learn more about the formula, he saw himself be killed by Ando, who had a power. Ando then took the formula before Tokyo was devastated by an unexplained disaster. After that in \"The Butterfly Effect,\" they travelled to Paris in search of the thief, identified as Daphne Millbrook, and Hiro explained to Ando that in the future he saw Ando kill him. Ando was shocked and told Hiro he could never do that when Daphne arrived. Events led to Hiro freezing time while Daphne held a knife at Ando's throat. Hiro saved Ando by allowing her to leave with the formula.\nThey continued to follow Daphne in the next episode, and she tried to drive Hiro and Ando apart by undermining Ando. Hiro and Ando noticed the Haitian, and discovered he was in possession of the other half of the formula. Ando knocked the Haitian out.\n\nDaphne managed to steal the other half from them, and before they can give chase, the Haitian awoke and apprehended them both, taking them to the Level 2 prisons of the Primatech Facility. The next episode showed Hiro and Ando arguing, with Ando claiming that Hiro did not value him as a partner. While trying to escape, Hiro realized he did need Ando. They almost escape, but are caught by the Haitian. He takes them to Angela Petrelli, who claims that Hiro has the \"key\" to solving the whole issue of the formula. Ando then helped Hiro dig up the key: Adam Monroe. In \"Angels and Monsters,\" Adam begrudgingly took Ando and Hiro to a bar that was a gathering place for \"specials for hire,\" and caused a fight. This led to Hiro being knocked out, and Adam escaping. Ando proclaimed them \"the worst heroes ever,\" before Daphne and Knox entered the bar, wanting to recruit Hiro to the Pinehearst Company. Knox said that to prove himself, Hiro had to kill Ando, handing him a sabre sword.\n\nHiro appeared to do so, but in the next episode it was revealed that Hiro froze time. After that, he acquired a collapsible sword and fake blood, then traveled slightly back in time to tell Ando that, when the time came, he had to pretend to be dead. He returned to the correct moment, and stabbed Ando. When Daphne and Knox left, Ando stood up again. They travelled to Africa on their first assignment in search of Usutu, a man who could paint the future. Ando expressed doubt over their situation, saying they were working for the bad guys. Hiro reassured him it was simply to infiltrate Pinehearst. They were unable to capture Usutu through Hiro's time traveling abilities, so they tried to do it by hiding and waiting for him. He congratulates them for using their heads as opposed to Hiro's power, and in \"Eris Quod Sum\", offers Hiro and Ando the chance to take a spirit walk for guidance. Ando refused, and watched over Hiro as he slept in \"Villains.\" In \"It's Coming,\" he tried to save Hiro from Arthur Petrelli, but was tossed aside by Arthur's telekinesis. When Arthur became distracted, he and Hiro escaped.\n\nHiro though, had regressed back into his 10-year-old self, and Ando tried to help him reclaim his memories in a bowling alley. Hiro then teleported them to a comic book store, where Ando spotted a new issue of \"9th Wonders!\" and saw an opportunity to help Hiro become normal again. In the first part of \"The Eclipse,\" Ando was taken by Hiro to Mohinder Suresh's apartment to meet Matt Parkman, and the three followed the speedster after she fled to her childhood home. Hiro and Matt were shocked to discover their powers gone. While Matt attempted to talk to Daphne, Ando and Hiro left, with Hiro claiming to know a way to regain his power. Hiro takes him to a comic book store, and with the help of two comic book geeks Sam and Frack, the four search through copies of 9th Wonders! to learn of Hiro's fate and any possible way to repair his memory. After Frack discovers a scene depicting Hiro and Claire Bennet hiding as Kaito Nakamura gives baby Claire to her father Noah Bennet, Hiro teleports away without Ando.\n\nParkman and Daphne find Ando in the comic book store, and they try to figure out how to follow Hiro's adventure. Sam tells them that there is only one last copy of 9th Wonders!, given by Isaac Mendez to a bike courier before his death. Daphne takes Ando and Parkman to New York in \"Our Father\" to track the comic book down. They find the last copy, and discover that Hiro is stuck 16 years in the past as Arthur Petrelli has taken Hiro's powers. The three come to the conclusion that the only way to save Hiro is to find another time-traveler. Ando volunteers himself to take an experimental formula to give him the ability to manipulate space and time so he can save Hiro. In \"Dual,\" Daphne steals a dose of the formula from Mohinder, and gives it to Ando. Ando manifests the ability to \"super charge\" the abilities of others, which he uses on Daphne to allow her to run faster than the speed of light, enabling time travel per Einstein's Theory of Relativity. They rescue Hiro from the past, saving Hiro from death at the hands of his father but likewise preventing Hiro from destroying the formula. Nevertheless, Hiro is able to steal the formula in the present with Daphne's help and the group celebrates as he destroys it.\n\nIn \"A Clear and Present Danger\" Hiro and Ando are back in Japan. Hiro has bought an abandoned fire station as their headquarters. Ando leaves Hiro frustrated after he's injected with a GPS device and feels that Hiro is trying to live through him since he has lost his powers. Later, Ando hears Hiro being kidnapped by Nathan's agents through the phone.\n\nIn \"Trust and Blood,\" using the GPS device Hiro injected himself with, Ando figures out that Hiro is in Arkansas. Daphne arrives in Japan to find Hiro and Ando to talk about Matt's disappearance. Daphne and Ando go to Arkansas and see the plane's crash site. After Daphne appears to have been killed and Claire uses herself as a shield, Ando, Mohinder, Matt, and Hiro escape and meet up with Peter. Then he and Hiro realize that they must travel to India as seen in one of Matt's paintings.\n\nIn \"Building 26,\" once in India, Hiro and Ando realize that they must save a local girl, Annapoora, from being married against her will. At first Ando uses his red glow as the sign she was looking for, but he \"steals\" Hiro's chance to recover his powers and also he ends up being kidnapped by the groom to force Annapoora into marriage. Finally, Hiro realizes that he does not need powers to be a hero, as he saved the girl without them, getting Ando back too. Later, Annapoora gives them a message \"Rebel\" sent them: to find Matt Parkman in LA.\n\nAs seen in \"Shades of Gray\" and continued in \"Cold Snap,\" Hiro and Ando arrive Los Angeles where they find that the Matt Parkman \"Rebel\" was referring to was only a baby, also named Matt Parkman. Later they discover that this is actually the son of the Matt Parkman they know, and also discover the baby possesses the ability to touch things and make them \"go.\" While Hiro and Ando are convincing Janice that Matt Sr. is not a terrorist and that his baby is in danger, agents take Janice away and break into the house. Ando shows that his acquired ability can also be used as an offensive weapon when he channels the energy outward to hit one of the pursuing agents, before Hiro manages to stop time with his partially restored ability (Matt Jr. used his powers to restore part of Hiro's). Hiro carries baby Matt and a paralyzed Ando to safety as he is unable to teleport, having only regained the ability to stop time.\n\nIn \"Turn and Face the Strange,\" Hiro and Ando have the mission to take baby Matt to Matt Sr., but Matt Jr. keeps inactivating any vehicle they are on due to the noise they make, until Ando comes with a funny face to entertain the baby, so Hiro convinces him to keep it so the \"cube\" can go. They finally manage to track down Matt Sr. who has gone to confront Danko. Hiro ends up saving Matt, and then he meets his son for the first time, giving Matt a reason to live again.\n\nIn \"I Am Sylar,\" after failing to convince Matt to join them, Hiro and Ando go to Reed Street Laboratories to set up a trap for HLS agents, using Ando as bait. Although he refuses, as Hiro manages to not freeze him, Hiro still keeps his plan going on, unfreezing the agents so they can take down Ando, and then freezing everybody again so he can take an agent's place as they carry Ando to the \"Building 26.\" Once in motion, Ando is awoken by Hiro so he can be ready for action, but when an agent realizes Hiro is not one of them, Ando shoots a big blast of red lightning, affecting everyone and saving Hiro. As plan B, they use the GPS signal of the agents to track the place, and once they are ready to fight, Hiro tries to freeze time, but instead he receives a strong headache and nosebleed as they realize he cannot use his ability anymore. Ando is then seen aiding Hiro.\n\nIn \"An Invisible Thread,\" because of Hiro's condition, Ando plans to enter \"Building 26\" by himself, but Hiro recovers and insists on continuing with the plan despite the danger. Hiro stops time and both break in to free the trapped prisoners, including Mohinder, Noah and Danko, and replace the drugged evolved humans with all of the \"Building 26\" staff. Once time is going, Hiro and Ando show the freed prisoners the way out. Ando asks Mohinder to check out Hiro, finding out his body is rejecting his powers and he should stop using them. As Hiro faints after saving Noah from Danko, is apparently taken to a hospital by Ando and Mohinder. Later, Ando, along with Hiro, witness the burning of Sylar's (really James Martin) body and then both decide to return home.\n\nIn \"Orientation,\" Ando and Hiro have opened a hired hero business called Dial-A-Hero settled in a conference room at the Yamagato Building, which enrages Kimiko. On Ando insistence to visit a doctor, Hiro reveals that his headaches are caused by a terminal illness, and he is dying. Attending their first mission, saving a girl's cat, both Ando and Hiro realize their abilities are not fitted to the situation, but still Ando is forced by Hiro to help the cat. Once he catches the cat, Ando loses balance and falls. Hiro stops time saving him, but Ando notices Hiro remains frozen while time is resumed. Ando then takes Hiro to Yamagato where he unfreezes. While talking, they remember the carnival they attended 14 years before, where a fortune teller directed Hiro on his path to being a hero. Ando remembers as he accidentally spilled a drink over Kimiko, causing her to hate him despite he was in love with her. While remembering this, Hiro's time travel manifests teleporting him to the carnival 14 years in the past.\n\nIn \"Jump, Push, Fall,\" while Hiro is at the carnival in the past, a young Ando is seen together with a young Kimiko in the carnival. The young Hiro rushes into them making Ando spill a Slushy in Kimiko's direction, but Samuel Sullivan pushes adult Hiro in the way to show him past can be changed, so he gets wet instead of Kimiko. This event avoids Ando to be hated by Kimiko, and when adult Hiro teleports back to the present, he finds out the two of them felt in love at the carnival and have dated since.\n\nIn \"Acceptance,\" Kimiko reveals to Hiro that she and Ando have gotten engaged. Ando is concerned about Kimiko wanting Hiro to give her away in the wedding a year from now, knowing that he may not be alive by that time, so he talks Hiro into confessing the truth to Kimiko. Hiro's ever-lasting mission to save a man makes him hear this speech from Ando over and over again, and finally understands the picture. Ultimately, Hiro tells Kimiko the truth about his illness, and then suffers a headache; Ando rushes in the office to help him, but Hiro teleports away in front of Ando and Kimiko, leaving her extremely shocked.\n\nIn \"Once Upon a Time in Texas,\" as Hiro travels back in time 3 years to Midland, Texas to save Charlie, he meets past-Ando waiting for past-Hiro to teleport back (\"Seven Minutes to Midnight\" timeline). Hiro convinces past-Ando to stay at the diner to avoid making too many changes and preserve history.\n\nIn \"Upon This Rock,\" a brain-addled Hiro is brought to Ando by the police after they find a business card on him. Ando reveals that Hiro has been missing for six weeks and figures that Hiro's referring to himself and everything else as fictional characters (with Ando being Sancho Panza) is a side-effect of his brain tumor. Ando does not understand what Hiro means by they have to save \"Doctor Watson\" at \"Arkham\" in the land of the \"swamp dragons,\" but decides to check Hiro's comics to try to figure it out. Ando eventually realizes that Hiro is referring to Florida when Hiro mentions Curt Connors and realizes that the \"swamp dragons\" are alligators and that Arkham refers to an insane asylum though he still does not understand the Doctor Watson reference. Ando searches on the web and finds that there's an asylum on Arkham Road in Florida and realizes that Hiro means Ando is his sidekick when he refers to him as Sancho Panza. Ando admits this, but Hiro refers to him as the best sidekick he knows.\n\nIn \"Close to You,\" Ando checks Hiro into the asylum Hiro keeps referring to, but is reluctant as Hiro in his addled state cannot stop time or use his powers. Hiro points Ando to \"Watson's\" room as he's led away, and after Ando uses his power to bypass a lock, he finds out \"Watson\" is Mohinder Suresh and realizes that Hiro wants to save him. Ando, realizing that Mohinder cannot use his powers due to the drugs the orderlies are giving him, switches Mohinder's pills with aspirin to stop that, but accidentally swallows Mohinder's pills and enters into a drug-induced daze. Hiro hides him in a closet and later that night frees Mohinder, but the two are forced to wheel Ando out in a wheelchair as he's still in a daze. As the three are found by orderlies, Ando snaps out of it and uses his powers to blast open a door leading out, creating enough of a distraction that Mohinder is able to overpower the orderlies and allow the three to escape. Running through a swamp chased by orderlies and dogs, the three are forced to hide behind a tree and Mohinder suggests Ando use his power like electro-shock therapy to restore Hiro's mind so he can teleport them away. Ando is reluctant as his future self killed Hiro using that power, but Mohinder convinces him to try. Ando shocks Hiro and it does work, restoring Hiro's mind back to normal. With Hiro back to normal, he teleports himself, Mohinder and Ando to Noah Bennet's apartment, seconds before orderlies and dogs find their hiding place. When the three teleport in, they interrupt Noah and Lauren Gilmore kissing and Hiro asks the two for their help.\n\nIn \"Pass/Fail,\" Ando and Hiro watch as Mohinder creates a compass for Noah to use and suggests Ando or Hiro as the ones that use it as only someone with powers can use it. After Mohinder leaves, Hiro collapses due to his brain tumor and Ando has him rushed to the hospital. There, Ando watches worried as the doctors prepare to perform brain surgery to try to remove the tumor and save Hiro's life. In Hiro's hallucination, Ando acts as his lawyer during his trial and his young self acts as a witness for the prosecution. In the real world, Ando watches the surgery and when Hiro crashes makes a rousing speech that gives Hiro strength in his hallucination. The doctors manage to revive Hiro and remove the tumor. Ando later visits Hiro as he recovers from the surgery.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" Ando is happy to see Hiro awake and has him test his powers which Hiro now has full control of after his tumor was removed. Ando and Hiro are shocked when Hiro receives a note from Charlie and Ando watches as a now old Charlie and Hiro reunite. When Hiro plans to travel back in time to get Charlie after she arrived in the past, Ando thinks Hiro is being selfish to try to do that as Charlie is clearly happy and leaves the room. He receives a call from Noah Bennet who wants him and Hiro to come to the Carnival in Central Park and Ando goes to get Hiro. Hiro has changed his mind about going back in time after talking to Charlie and now feels he has lost his purpose and has finished all of his missions, but Ando reminds him of Samuel and informs him of Noah's call. Hiro teleports himself and Ando to the Carnival where Claire asks Hiro to teleport all of the carnies away. Hiro tells them all to hold hands, but is unsure if he can teleport them all as there are over a dozen, so Ando offers to use his powers to supercharge Hiro's to teleport everyone. Hiro agrees to try and thanks to Ando supercharging his power, Hiro successfully teleports everyone away which results in Samuel's defeat as the removal of all the special reduces Samuel's power significantly.\n\nHiro and Ando walk through the Carnival after everything is over and plan to go home. The two witness Claire climbing up the Ferris Wheel and jumping off to reveal her power to the world.\n\n\nDuring the first two volumes, Ando is a normal human with no abilities. In the opening episode of the third season, \"The Second Coming,\" Hiro Nakamura travels into the future and witnesses Ando using an ability described by the writers simply as \"red lightning.\" In \"Dual,\" Ando injects himself with the formula, revealing that the red lightning amplifies the abilities of others. He demonstrates this unintentionally by boosting the range of Matt Parkman's telepathy to cover all of New York City and increasing Daphne Millbrook's super speed to such an extent that she is able to break the spacetime barrier. In the episode \"Cold Snap.\" Ando learns to use his power offensively, channeling his energy into powerful bolts through his hands in the classic Hadouken pose, wrists touching with palms exposed. As seen later in \"I Am Sylar,\" Ando is able to produce a large volume of energy with greater precision, as he attacks agents inside a van with a heavy blast without affecting Hiro or the van itself.\n\nIn \"Close To You,\" Ando displays the ability to use his power to slightly overload a keypad, allowing him to bypass a locked door without frying the system. He later is able to use a concussive energy blast to blast open a locked door to allow himself, Hiro and Mohinder Suresh to escape an insane asylum. He is also able to use his power as a shock similar to electro-shock therapy to restore Hiro's scrambled mind back to normal.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" when Hiro needs to teleport a lot of people to safety, Ando offers to supercharge Hiro's powers so he can do it. Thanks to Ando's supercharging, Hiro is able to teleport dozens of people an unknown distance with no apparent problems while before he has only been able to teleport two at most.\n", "id": "7705039", "categories": ["Fictional Japanese people", "Male characters in television", "Fictional characters introduced in 2006", "Fictional gamblers", "Heroes (U.S. TV series) characters", "Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities"], "title": "Ando Masahashi"}

It is operated under the auspices of the Trustees of the Christian Brothers and is situated within the borders of the Catholic Diocese of Broken Bay. The College was ranked 101st in the State for the 2005 Higher School Certificate marks, up from 108th the previous year. More recently, in 2013, the school again improved its rank to 73. It is a member of the Independent Schools Association (ISA) and the Junior School Heads Association of Australia.\n\nThe college operates as two separate schools: \"The Junior School\" catering for boys in Years 5 and 6, \"The Senior School\" catering for boys in Years 7 to 12.\n\nSt Pius X College started in 1937 as Christian Brothers Chatswood, initially going to the Beginner level, with the first Leaving Certificate class graduating in 1941.\n\nSt Pius X College used to be a co-educational school, partnered with Mercy College, however during the 20th century the partnership ended and each school became single sex. \n\nA major improvement in the 1990s was the development of Oxford Falls as an educational complex. Named the Treacy Centre, the facility comprises a variety of sports fields and venues as well as a number of meeting places and classrooms. In the late 1990s the college undertook extensive renovations and rebuilding.\nLater, during the late 2000s a new building was built, it includes; meeting rooms, stands, basketball courts and can facilitate stage plays (Pius Talent Show).\n\n\"Fide et Labore\" is written on the shield, which is Latin for \"By Faith and Labour\". The current principal is Mr John Couani, the first lay person to be principal at the school.\n\nThe college has recently implemented an E-Learning program, which provides students with personal learning devices, specifically the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 across the school. These computers act as learning aids and hold student text books.\n\nThe school participates in rugby, cricket, football, basketball, tennis, softball, swimming, squash and athletics.\n\nThe college also participates in debating and public speaking. It is a member of the Catholic Schools Debating Assosciation, the largest debating competition for schools in New South Wales and has since 2015 participated in the Sydney Debating Network. It enters students into the Legacy Youth Public Speaking and Plain English Speaking Competitions annually. In 2015 the 11 A debating team were runners up in the CSDA debating competition and were awarded the prestigious Aggregate Senior shield for winning the most debates out of any school in the competition. Following this in 2016 the 12 A team were Grand Final winners of the CSDA Senior Opens debating competition winning the Michael Robson Shield as champions of the Senior Competition. \n\nMusic has also always been a large part of extracurricular involvement at St Pius. The various bands include concert bands, jazz bands and guitar ensembles. In order to gain entry to any band, a student must audition. In order to gain access to the Senior Jazz Band and Senior Concert Band, generally a high level of skill is required in the instrument of which a student plays. \n\nThe bands and choir often play for the school as well at the Twilight Concert held every term. The twilight concert generally begins with the choir. After the choir have performed, the ensembles usually play next and after which, the Jazz and Concert Bands begin to play. The concert is usually held under Baby Brother (the junior school playground), however, if the weather is unfavourable, the concert takes place in the school gym. The school has also recently been involved with competitive hissing but no words on a performing group as of yet.\n\nPerforming Arts is an integral part of the College curriculum and students at St Pius X have every opportunity to make the performing arts an involved part of their lives, through participation in many different types of music and drama activities.\n\nSt Pius X College has the largest active robotics club in Australia with over 100 members. The school's robotic club takes part in robotics competitions. The two major annual competitions are the RoboCup and First Lego League (FLL). The club consists of members from years five through to twelve. Acceptance is usually granted through the robotics lessons held in class during year five, however, entry to the club in later years can also be granted through applying directly to the robotics coordinator.\n\nSt Pius’s Outdoor Education program facilitates personal development and teamwork through camps, excursions and overnight experiences. Outdoor Education is offered to all students, these experiences enhance learning, build relationships and respect, develop leadership and teamwork, as well as resilience as boys overcome fear and adversity as they push outside their comfort zones. Connection with nature also provides a platform for spiritual growth and experience. \n\nHighlights of the Outdoor Education Program include:\n\n\nStudents in Year 11 have the opportunity of entering the Mock Trial Competition conducted by the Law Society of New South Wales. During the competition the College's ‘legal team’ competes against other schools defending and prosecuting ‘mock’ cases involving assault, larceny, and negligence. Students take on the roles of barristers, clerks, court officers, magistrates, solicitors, and witnesses.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7705072", "categories": ["Independent Schools Association (Australia)", "Congregation of Christian Brothers schools", "Junior School Heads Association of Australia Member Schools", "Catholic secondary schools in Sydney", "Congregation of Christian Brothers secondary schools", "Boys' schools in New South Wales", "Educational institutions established in 1937", "Catholic primary schools in Sydney", "Chatswood, New South Wales"], "title": "St Pius X College"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7705126", "text": "Ahmed Diraige\n\nAhmad Ibrahim Diraige is the former governor of the Sudanese province of Darfur and current head of the National Redemption Front alliance of rebel groups in the Darfur conflict. He currently resides in the United Kingdom.\n\nDiraige is a Fur, born to a \"shartai\" (paramount chief). In December 1963, as a young politician, he created the Darfur Development Front (DDF) to create a common agenda to advocate for the region's interests. However, he proved unable to bring all the provincial interests into a common front. Although, the Front was popular from its creation with Fur because of its founder's ethnic connections, it was open to all Darfuris; its name suggesting that \"development\" should be the primary concern of political action. By the time of the February 1968 election, the politics had become ethnically polarized between rival factions of the Umma Party. Sadiq al-Mahdi, calculating that the province's demographics favored the \"African\" tribes, successfully courted the DDF, leaving Imam al-Hadi to mobilize the \"Arab\" vote. Sadiq's faction won 13 of 24 seats, while the faction led by al-Hadi received seven. The factions were reconciled only when the parliamentary government was overthrown by the military coup of Col. Gaafar Nimeiry in May 1969. Both Diraige and al-Sadiq were arrested, while al-Hadi was executed.\n\nIn 1979, Darfuris rioted after their province became the only one in which the governor, al-Tayeb al-Mardi, was not locally chosen. Nimeiry had chosen al-Tayeb al-Mardi to oversee the support to the Chadian guerilla force led by Hissène Habré, but grew concerned that he was losing control of the situation. In January 1980, he dismissed al-Tayeb al-Mardi and appointed Diraige. The appointment of the DDR leader resulted in an immediate lessening of tensions. Diraige refused to accept a salary and quickly concentrated on replacing posts filled due to political patronage with largely apolitical civil servants from across the ethnic spectrum who had all been affiliated with the DDF since 1964. The many problems facing the provincial government, including rising racial tensions, the accumulated administrative neglect and spillover from the conflict in Chad, was soon superseded by steadily diminishing rains. In the 1981 provincial elections, ethnicity had become a dominant political factor and Diraige, with his large Fur base of support and long out of jail, easily won the governorship. His election, in turn sparked plans by Darfuri Arabs to join with the Zaghawa and Fellata and form an \"Arab Alliance.\"\n\nThe Diraige government soon realized that they could not dig water boreholes quickly enough to make up for the lowered amount of rainfall. In November 1983, Diraige wrote a letter to Nimeiry warning him that, unless foreign food aid was requested, Darfur faced a serious famine. This letter would come to be known as the \"famine letter.\" Since 1977, Nimeiry had been creating an image of Sudan as the \"future breadbasket of the Arab world\", was furious with Diraige for sending this inconvenient letter and refused to respond. On 23 December 1983, Diraige flew to Khartoum to present his case in person. Nimeiry made his displeasure clear and stated that he would not ask for aid. An arrest warrant for Diraige was issued about 48 hours later, which he escaped by flying to Saudi Arabia. By August 1984, the existence of the famine was obvious and Nimeiry was forced to declare Darfur a \"disaster zone\". The story of Diraige, the first locally accountable governor who had been forced into exile for warning of a preventable famine, became widely known, further aggravating tensions between Darfur and the northerner-dominated government.\n\nBy 1987, the situation had worsened. The Libya-Chad War overflowed into the province, resulting in widespread violence. Many Fur military conscripts fighting the Second Sudanese Civil War deserted to the side of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Sudanese Brig. Fadlallah Burma Nasir and Chief of Staff Brig. Fawzi Ahmed el-Fadl visited Diraige at his home in London, asking if he would come back and support the government to stop the desertion of Fur soldiers. Diraige refused. In the late 1980s, Darfuri politician Daud Bolad sought help from the SPLA in extending the rebellion to Darfur. Other leftist leaders, such as Diraige, believed that the SPLA would use them for its own purpose and intentionally did not associate themselves with the southern rebels. Bolad's capture in 1991 and the destruction of his resistance network was seen as confirmation that this was the correct stance.\n\nDiraige created the Sudan Federal Democratic Alliance (SFDA), a member organization of the opposition National Democratic Alliance. From 1996, SFDA deputy Sharif Harir set up an office in Asmara, Eritrea, from which it actively recruited armed fighters from migrant Darfuris. On 23 January 2004, Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Taha met Diraige in Nairobi, while ostensibly on hajj break from talks in Naivasha ending the war in the south. Diraige used his personal credibility to get the Darfuri rebels to agree to talks on humanitarian matters in Geneva to be mediated by the Henri Dunant Foundation, as a trust-building first step. The government then broke Diraige's trust by publicly demanding a meeting on \"national reconciliation\" in Khartoum. This had been the last line of communication that the government still had with the Fur rebels. In 2003, the Darfur Liberation Front, a new rebel group fighting a steadily escalating conflict asked the SFDA for political and logistical support. Harir agreed and declared that the DLF fighters were the military wing of the SFDA. However, Diraige disagreed that this was the time for armed rebellion and the DLF got no substantive support.\n\nThis position apparently changed. In June 2006, Diraige was named the head of the National Redemption Front, a coalition of the SFDA, Justice and Equality Movement and the faction of the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) that had not signed the May deal taken by the faction of the SLA led by Minni Minnawi.\n\n", "id": "7705126", "categories": ["Living people", "People from Darfur", "Year of birth missing (living people)", "Sudanese politicians"], "title": "Ahmed Diraige"}

It is also known as Ježiško in Slovakia, Jezušček in Slovenia and as Jézuska in Hungary.\n\nThere is no accurate description of Ježíšek. He has been depicted as a baby, toddler, and young lad. Some even consider him simply as an abstract figure. According to tradition, Ježíšek makes his appearance on Christmas Eve. After families have the traditional Czech dinner of carp, potato salad, carp soup or pea soup family with children go to some room and watch the sky and look out for Ježíšek. Meanwhile, someone rings a bell. After that, children run to a room where there are already presents. In some families Ježíšek also sets up a Christmas tree. In others, parents buy a tree and the whole family decorates it. Young children open their gifts on 24 December.\n\nThe tradition of Ježíšek has been observed by the Czechs for more than 400 years. This is partly due to the large population of Catholics during that period. It was Martin Luther who coined the term during the 16th century, an attempt to provide a suitable name to their figure other than St. Nicholas.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Communist regime was largely promoting Děda Mraz (Ded Moroz) over Ježíšek, but Czech families didn't go for it. \n\nIn 1989, after the Velvet Revolution that overthrew the communist regime, local entrepreneurs began introducing Santa Claus to the country. He appeared in shop windows and town gatherings. Czech children were surprised to learn that their toys were given to them by an old man instead of the figure they grew up with. Despite the growing presence of Santa Claus, Ježíšek continues to be a popular tradition.\n\nIn December 1996, 80 Santa Clauses held a rally at the heart of traditional Prague in another attempt to make the Western figure popular with the children. It had moderate success, which eventually paved the way for Zachraňte Ježíška’s petition to actively protect local Christmas traditions.\n\nAt present, belief in Ježíšek is upheld in modern Czech society, despite having the lowest rates of religious affiliation in the world.\n\n\n", "id": "7705175", "categories": ["Christian folklore", "Christmas characters", "Fictional Christian saints"], "title": "Ježíšek"}

Thomas was a grandson of Irish surgeon Sylvester O'Halloran, and brother to William Littlejohn O'Halloran.\n\nO'Halloran entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (or Marlow) in 1808 and at 16 he was commissioned into the 17th Foot and sailed for India. He served in the Nepal war during the years 1814, 1815, and 1816, became Lieutenant in June 1817, and served in the Deccan war during that and the following year. On 1 August 1821 he married Miss Anne Goss of Dawlish, Devonshire, who died in 1823 in Calcutta, leaving two children. In 1822 he exchanged from the 17th to the 44th Regiment, which he joined in Calcutta in January 1823. In 1824 he was ordered with the left wing of the 44th to Chittagong, where he arrived early in June, and was appointed paymaster, quartermaster, and interpreter. On 30 October he was appointed brigade-major to Brigadier-General Dunkin, C.B., who commanded the Sylket division of the army during the Burmese war, and served on his staff until his death in Nov. 1825. He received a medal for war service in India, for Nepal and Ava.\n\nO'Halloran transferred to the 99th Foot as a Captain in 1827. He returned to England after twenty years in India in 1834. On 10 July 1834 he married Miss Jane Waring, of Newry, County Down, and retired on half-pay in October of that year. Soon afterwards he transferred to the Coldstream Guards and was on half pay until he transferred again to the 97th Foot in May 1837.\n\nIn 1838 O'Halloran retired from the army by the sale of his commission, and sailed for South Australia the same year with his family in the \"Rajahstan\", landing at Glenelg on 21 November 1838. He established a farm, \"Lizard Lodge\" in the Adelaide suburb which now bears his name, O'Halloran Hill. He was made a J.P. in 1839. He was gazetted Major-Commandant of the South Australian Militia on 26 February 1840, and on 8 June as Commissioner of Police.\n\nIn December 1839 he was appointed by George Gawler as one of four members of a Board of Police Commissioners. Upon the dismissal of the founder and first commander of the police, Superintendent Henry Inman in May 1840, the Board was abolished and O'Halloran was appointed under a new title of Police Commissioner. He retired from Government service in 1843 as a result of his disinclination to serve as both Police Commissioner and Police Magistrate.\n\nIn June 1840, the brig \"Maria\" set sail from Port Adelaide towards Hobart. By July 1840, stories and rumours had circulated that all 26 people on board had survived a shipwreck, but had been murdered by members of the Ngarrindjeri along the Coorong. After a police investigation, which discovered some of the bodies and determined who the murderers were believed to be, Governor Gawler ordered O'Halloran (as police commissioner) and Police Inspector Alexander Tolmer to lead a party of police and sailors to the area. His orders were to find and execute those responsible.\n\nOn 22 August 1840, after several days of interviews, investigations and a drumhead court-martial, two Ngarrindjeri men were publicly hanged on the Coorong in front of 65 people from their tribe. O'Halloran then told the people (through an interpreter) that their bodies were not to be taken down and that this was to be a warning against violence towards Europeans by Aboriginal people.\n\nThis was one of the most contentious incidents in South Australian legal history. At the time, Aboriginals in South Australia were considered British subjects, and therefore deemed to be under the protection of British law. Gawler's ordering of a drumhead court-martial and the executions was not well received by the London authorities and contributed to his removal as governor.\n\nAt that same time O'Halloran's younger brother, Captain (later Major General) Henry Dunn O'Halloran (1800–71), 69th Regt., posted at New Brunswick, Canada, was conducting a significant study of the language and customs of the indigenous Mi'kmaq people. http://archives.gnb.ca/Associates/Newsletters/2006-22-spring-e.pdf\n\nAlthough O'Halloran attracted a reputation for belligerence, one of his mounted troopers of the 1840s related that, \"Old Major O'Halloran used to say 'I never hated a man longer than a day'\".\n\nO'Halloran married Anne Goss (died 1823) on 1 August 1821; she had two daughters. He married again, on 10 July 1834, to Jane Waring; they had three sons and one daughter. His eldest son Thomas Joseph Shuldham O'Halloran SM, married Harriet Julia Woodforde, daughter of the Adelaide Coroner. Their son Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran KC was a noted lawyer and football administrator in South Australia. A daughter Eliza O'Halloran married farmer and flour miller Samuel White in 1853.\n\nO'Halloran died at his home \"Lizard Lodge\", and was buried at Christ Church, O'Halloran Hill, an Anglican church which he helped to establish and is also located in the suburb, now overlooking \"Glenthorne\" CSIRO Research station.\n\n\n", "id": "7705208", "categories": ["Coldstream Guards officers", "Wiltshire Regiment officers", "1797 births", "Australian Anglicans", "Members of the South Australian Legislative Council", "Settlers of South Australia", "Royal Leicestershire Regiment officers", "Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst", "Commissioners of the South Australia Police", "1870 deaths", "Australian people of Irish descent"], "title": "Thomas Shuldham O'Halloran"}

He served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, as well as the U.S. House of Representatives, after which he published accounts of his wartime exploits and captivity.\n\nFulkerson was born on May 13, 1834, in Washington County, Virginia, the youngest son of Abram Fulkerson, Sr. (1789 - 1859) of Lee County, Virginia and his wife Margaret Laughlin Vance (1796–1864). His family took pride in their military heritage. His grandfather, James Fulkerson, had also served as a Captain, in the Virginia Militia during the American Revolution, joining with the Overmountain Men and fighting the British at the Battle of Kings Mountain. His father, Abram Fulkerson Sr., had served during the War of 1812 as a captain of a Virginia Militia company in Colonel David Sanders' Regiment, 4th Brigade, Norfolk Division under Gen. Peter B. Porter, but by 1850 had moved to Grainger County, Tennessee, where his eldest son James L. Fulkerson died, although Abram Fulkerson Sr. moved back to Washington County, Virginia, before his death in 1859. The family included at least four more sons who survived to adulthood: James Lyon Fulkerson (1816-1849), Samuel Vance Fulkerson(1822-1862), Francis Marion Fulkerson (1825-1894) and Isaac Fulkerson (1831-1889). They also had daughters Mary Vance Fulkerson Davis (1820-1892), Harriet Jane Fulkerson Armstrong (1827-1911) and Katherine Elizabeth Fulkerson (1832-1903).\n\nAbram, Jr. graduated from the Virginia Military Institute at Lexington in 1857, where he was a student of Prof. Thomas Jonathan Stonewall Jackson, as had been his elder brother Samuel Vance Fulkerson (1822-1862), who had served in the Mexican–American War and as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850. According to VMI records, Isaac Fulkerson had a reputation for being a prankster and wore an \"outlandish collar\" on his cadet uniform: the collar being the only part of the uniform not covered under regulations. After graduation, he taught school in Palmyra, Virginia, then in 1860 in Rogersville, Hawkins County, Tennessee.\n\nFulkerson entered Confederate military service in June 1861 as a Captain, having organized a company of men from Hawkins County, Tennessee, that was mustered into the 19th Tennessee Infantry Regiment as Company K (The Hawkins Boys) at Knoxville, Tennessee. His was the first company of volunteers organized in East Tennessee, and Abram Fulkerson received a commission as the regiment's Major. He was wounded in the thigh and his horse shot from under him at the Battle of Shiloh. After recovery and the unit's reorganization, he was reassigned to the 63rd Tennessee Infantry. Commissioned as Lieutenant Colonel of the 63rd, and President Jefferson Davis on February 12, 1864, commissioned him as a full colonel.\n\nIn January 1862, Abram Fulkerson received a furlough and went to Clarksville, Tennessee and married his fiancé, Selina Johnson (1832-1918) on January 28. They were barely married in time to escape the Union Army's advance on Clarksville. In June, 1862 his brother Col. Samuel Vance Fulkerson was killed in action leading the 37th Virginia Infantry at the Battle of Gaines Mill, the first major victory of General Robert E. Lee. Another brother, Isaac Fulkerson (c. 1829-July 20, 1889), was a captain in the 8th Texas Cavalry (Terry's Texas Rangers).\n\nAbram Fulkerson twice helped garrison the Cumberland Gap: first with the 19th Tennessee then with the 63rd Tennessee. On May 18, 1863, while at Cumberland Gap, he penned a letter to his wife in which he noted that he was visited there by President Jefferson Davis:\n\nOne of our pickets came in the other day and reported that a Mr. Davis was at the lines and desired to enter. This report took me very much by surprise, for although you had mentioned the probability of his coming yet I did not look for him. He only stayed a few hours. After dinner (a very poor one without apology to him) I went [around] to show him some of the curiosities of Cumberland Gap, which he seemed to think would compensate any one for making the visit. He went back up the valley and expected to get home by Wednesday next.\n\nIn the same letter, he addressed the news of General Stonewall Jackson's death:\n\nThe intelligence of the death of Gen. Jackson came upon us like a shock. We feel that his death is a national calamity. The poorest soldiers among us appreciated his worth - loved the man, and mourn his loss. I knew him well.1 He was my preceptor for more than four years and whilst during that time I did not appreciate the man, as school [schoolboys?]are not like to do, yet I always had great reverence for the man on account of his piety & uprightness of character. Among the many heroes of this revolution, none have lived so much adored, none have died so much deplored, and none have left a character as spotless as that of Stonewall Jackson. Could his life have been spared till the close of this cruel war, the unanimous voice of a grateful people would have proclaimed him chief ruler of the nation. But God has seen proper to take him from us, and what He does is right and for the best. It is [illegible] therefore that we make the sacrifice cheerfully, th'o we cannot see why our country should be deprived of his services at his her hour of greatest need.\n\nWhile in the 63rd, Fulkerson was wounded twice more: in the left arm at the Battle of Chickamauga and again at the Second Battle of Petersburg, Virginia (Battle of Petersburg II), the regiment having been reassigned from the Army of Tennessee to the Army of Northern Virginia. He was taken prisoner on June 17, 1864, and sent to the POW camp at Fort Delaware.\n\nOn April 18, 1892, Fulkerson wrote an account of his capture and experiences as a prisoner. He related the events of his capture:\n\nWhile a POW, Fulkerson became part of the Immortal Six Hundred, 600 captured Confederate officers who were taken to Morris Island at Charleston, South Carolina and used as human shields by the Union Army for six weeks in an attempt to silence the Confederate gunners at Fort Sumter, in response to Union officer prisoners being placed among civilians to stop Union gunners from firing into downtown Charleston. Though none of the Immortal Six Hundred were killed by the continuing Confederate artillery fire from Fort Sumter, 14 died of dysentery.\n\nOf his time on Morris Island he wrote in the same 1892 account:\n\nAfter Morris Island, Fulkerson was taken to Fort Pulaski and placed on starvation rations for 42 days in retaliation for Confederate prisoner abuses at Andersonville. Crowded into the fort's cold, damp casements, the Confederates' \"retaliation ration\" consisted of 10 ounces of moldy cornmeal and a half pint of soured onion pickles. The starving men supplemented their rations with the occasional rat or stray cat. Thirteen men died there of preventable diseases such as dysentery and scurvy.\n\nAt Fort Pulaski, the prisoners organized \"The Relief Association of Fort Pulaski for Aid and Relief of the Sick and Less Fortunate Prisoners\" on December 13, 1864, and Fulkerson was elected president. Out of their sparse funds, the prisoners collected and spent eleven dollars, according to a report filed by Fulkerson on December 28, 1864.\n\nIn March 1865 Fulkerson was returned to Fort Delaware, where he was discharged and paroled on July 25, 1865, months after General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox.\n\nWhile at Fort Delaware, prisoners were taken out to the badly polluted river every day and allowed to bathe and swim. Fulkerson, a very thin man with auburn hair, could float \"like a cork\" and would lie on his back and float out with the current for ten or fifteen minutes until the nervous guards, fearing that an escape attempt, ordered him to return to the shore.\n\nAfter Fulkerson returned home, his horse that he rode during his military service, whose official name was \"Zollicoffer\" (after former Congressman and early Confederate casualty Felix Zollicoffer), was returned to him. Fulkerson kept the horse for the rest of its life, but called him \"Old Bob.\" When the horse died, former Confederates from the Bristol area assembled and conducted a military funeral for it. In 1885, Stonewall Jackson's horse, \"Little Sorrel,\" was brought to Bristol on a tour and Fulkerson rode it as a number of former veterans assembled to pay their respects.\n\nAs the war ended, Fulkerson studied law, was admitted to the bar and began his legal practice in Goodson, later known as Bristol, Virginia, in 1866 with the firm of York & Fulkerson. As a lawyer, he was regarded as a legal giant in Bristol and it is said that he was such a gifted orator that many of the local citizens would go to court and sit in on trials just to hear him speak.\n\nFulkerson was elected and re-elected to the Virginia House of Delegates as one of two delegates representing Washington County, Virginia (part-time). He served from 1871 to 1875, until voters replaced both delegates. Next he served in the State senate of Virginia 1877-1881.\n\nVoters from Virginia's 9th congressional district elected Fulkerson as a Readjuster Democrat from to the Forty-seventh Congress (March 4, 1881 – March 3, 1883). He defeating incumbent James Buchanan Richmond, a lawyer and banker (and former subordinate officer to his brother Samuel in the 37th Virginia), in the Democratic primary. Fulkerson helped organize the Readjuster Party, after which he returned to the Democratic Party.\n\nFulkerson resumed his legal practice after deciding against seeking re-election to Congress. Fellow Readjuster Henry Bowen succeeded him. Voters again elected Fulkerson to the State House of Delegates in 1888, alongside John A. Buchanan who together replaced Daniel Trigg and Jonas S. Kelly and were in turn replaced in 1887 by John Roberts and S. P. Edmonson.\n\nAfter retiring from politics, Fulkerson wrote a memoir of his captivity and published it in 1894. Fulkerson was a delegate to the Democratic National (Gold) Convention in 1896.\n\nFulkerson died in Bristol, Virginia, on December 17, 1902, at the age of 68, of complications after suffering a stroke. He was buried there in East Hill Cemetery in Sullivan County, Tennessee. Henry Clinton Wood who served as the Major of the 37th Virginia Infantry (CS) under Fulkerson's brother Samuel Vance, and for whom the town of Clintwood, Virginia, was named, served as an honorary pallbearer in the funeral. His widow would survive for a decade, and his son Samuel Vance Fulkerson (1863-1926), although he married in Grayson, Texas, would become a Virginia lawyer and die aged 64 in Virginia Beach on July 2, 1926, and be buried in the same cemetery.\n\nVMI maintains the Fulkerson family papers in its library's archives. The Sons of Confederate Veterans Abram Fulkerson Camp 2104 in Greeley, Colorado, bears his name.\n\nHis descendant third cousin, Joe Adkins, portrays Fulkerson at Civil War reenactments. A member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Adkins commands the Gen. Alfred E. Jackson Camp 2159 in Jonesborough, Tennessee.\n\n", "id": "7705292", "categories": ["People of Tennessee in the American Civil War", "1834 births", "Virginia lawyers", "Members of the Virginia House of Delegates", "People from Washington County, Virginia", "1902 deaths", "Members of the United States House of Representatives from Virginia", "American Civil War prisoners of war", "Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives", "Virginia Democrats", "Confederate States Army officers"], "title": "Abram Fulkerson"}

Hirai found similarities in Ueshiba's art based on circular motions with his own style of jujutsu he was developing and decided to enter Ueshiba's Kobukan dojo.\n\nDuring World War II, Hirai was the head of the jujutsu department of the Japanese Army's military police school and was instrumental in developing a new arrest technique employed by the military police.\n\nIn 1942, he was appointed director of the General Affairs for the Kobukan Dojo by Ueshiba, helping him with daily matters at the dojo. The same year he was sent as the Kobukan representative to the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, an organization promoting martial arts in Japan, and was instrumental in creating the term \"aikido\" to refer to Ueshiba's art within the Butokukai's circle.\n\nIn July 1945, the Butokukai awarded him the rank of \"Hanshi\".\n\nHe died in 1998.\n\nHis own style, , was founded in 1938 and combined elements from classical jujutsu and traditional Japanese weaponry with the early teachings of Ueshiba. It is based on the principle of circular tai sabaki. In October 1945, he established the Korindo Dojo in Shizuoka. In September 1953, the Korindo Dojo in Tokyo was inaugurated.\n\nKorindo’s taisabaki consists of seven forms or kata: kesagiri, kote-sabaki, irimisabaki, shihosabaki, isogaeshi, tsuiage e ushirosabaki. Usually they are practiced solo, but they can also be done with a partner. These seven kata are practiced to the front, back, right, and left, and they help develop the ability to apply techniques from any position. Minoru Hirai’s unique taisabaki forms, which constitute the basis of his Korindo Aikido, can be practiced empty-handed, with a sword, short staff, or spear. The goal is to express the natural mind as natural martial arts techniques.\n\n", "id": "7705481", "categories": ["Martial arts school founders", "1903 births", "Japanese aikidoka", "1998 deaths", "People from Okayama Prefecture"], "title": "Minoru Hirai"}

He joined the Argentine Navy and had an unremarkable career until the 1946 election of Juan Perón.\n\nHe was Naval attache in Brazil and Uruguay, and later he became close to the influential First Lady, Eva Perón, and served as her naval aide-de-camp until her death in 1952. He was then named head of the Río Santiago Naval Academy (site of an important naval shipyard), though in August 1955, he was persuaded to take part in the coup d'état that toppled Perón on September 19. Credited with leading the Navy during the rebellion, Rojas obtained Perón's resignation and exile by commandeering the ARA General Belgrano - threatening to bombard the YPF refinery in Ensenada (then the nation's largest).\n\nOn 23 September 1955 he was rewarded with the Vice Presidency at the Navy's insistence, and remained in the post until President Pedro Aramburu relinquished power to elected authorities in May 1958.\n\nRojas imposed a staunch anti-Peronist and anti-Communist as Vice President, though he supported Aramburu's call for Constitutional Assembly elections in 1957, overcoming objections from the largely conservative Navy.

Following Army Chief Juan Carlos Onganía's defeat of the coup attempt, Rojas was confined to his uptown Buenos Aires apartment, after which he largely limited his contact with the public to occasional columns in conservative newspapers such as \"La Prensa\" and \"La Nación\". He opposed the Antarctic Treaty of 1961 and later to the Beagle Channel Arbitration. He was founder of the “Movimiento Pro-impugnación del Laudo Arbitral del Beagle” and was a staunch supporter of the ill-fated Falklands War against Britain, making it his dying wish that his ashes be scattered at the site of the tragic sinking of the Belgrano during the 1982 conflict.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7705531", "categories": ["Place of birth missing", "Vice Presidents of Argentina", "1993 deaths", "Argentine anti-communists", "1906 births", "People from Buenos Aires", "Argentine people of Spanish descent", "Argentine Navy admirals"], "title": "Isaac Rojas"}

Jardine was known for upset victories in bouts he took at short notice against highly rated fighters. His best wins were in contests with former UFC Light Heavyweight Champions and UFC Hall of Famers Chuck Liddell and Forrest Griffin. Jardine's unorthodox attacking style wrongfooted opponents, but left him vulnerable in some career-crucial contests, and by his mid-30s he had effectively retired from competing to concentrate on a 'Paleo' business venture. Building on experience as a stuntman and in non-speaking parts, Jardine has established himself as an actor in film and television.\n\nJardine was born in Butte, Montana, moved to Oregon, and finally settled in Los Angeles, California, where he attended Canoga Park High School. Jardine played football and competed in Greco-Roman wrestling in high school under Coach Rudy Lugo, and continued to compete at Los Angeles Pierce College, then for his final two years of college as a defensive lineman at New Mexico Highlands University, which has a Division II program. He received a degree in Human Performance and Sport from New Mexico Highlands University. Before focusing on a career in mixed martial arts, Jardine worked as a personal trainer, firefighter, football coach, miner, and bounty hunter. He also played rugby and competed in high-level wrestling tournaments after college before traveling to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he began training for MMA with Greg Jackson.\nJardine recently featured on a social media video that went viral where he proceeded to track down a thief and make a citizen's arrest.\n\nJardine made his professional mixed martial arts debut in 2001, defeating Amir Rahnavardi via armbar submission. He would win five out of his next six bouts, suffering one knockout loss to Travis Wiuff six seconds into the fight, before debuting in the Japanese Pancrase organization in 2003. Jardine's bout in Pancrase, with Keiichiro Yamamiya, ended in a draw. Jardine defeated his next two opponents, including a submission win over Red Devil Sport Club fighter Arman Gambaryan, before appearing on The Ultimate Fighter 2.\n\nIn 2005, Jardine was cast on \"The Ultimate Fighter 2\", a team-based reality television show created by the UFC, as a Heavyweight competitor. He was the first Heavyweight to be chosen by team coach and then UFC Middleweight Champion Rich Franklin. Although considered a favorite to proceed to the Heavyweight division's finals, Jardine was not selected to fight until the semi-finals, where he was defeated by eventual Heavyweight winner and his future sparring partner, Rashad Evans.\n\nJardine made his first appearance on an official UFC fight card at \"The Ultimate Fighter 2 Finale\", defeating fellow TUF 2 Heavyweight Kerry Schall by TKO due to leg kicks. Jardine was signed to the UFC and subsequently dropped down a weight class to the Light Heavyweight division. His next appearance was at \"UFC 57\" where he defeated Mike Whitehead, another The Ultimate Fighter 2 competitor, by unanimous decision.\n\nIn April 2006, Jardine fought The Ultimate Fighter 1 Light Heavyweight finalist Stephan Bonnar at \"Ultimate Fight Night 4\". Jardine lost the fight in part due to a very controversial unanimous decision, but gained a great deal of fan and media support after the bout. After the fight Jardine stated, \"Everyone knows that that Bonnar fight should have been my fight[...] I still get approached everyday about that. I am 3-1, but I don't necessarily look at it that way.\"\n\nJardine next faced American Top Team's Wilson Gouveia at The Ultimate Fighter 3 Finale. Although color commentator Joe Rogan believed that he lost the first round, Jardine managed to bounce back and defeat Gouveia via unanimous decision after three rounds. Jardine was then scheduled to fight Mike Nickels, a Light Heavyweight competitor from The Ultimate Fighter 3, but Nickels was forced to withdraw due to a back injury. Instead, he next faced The Ultimate Fighter 1 Light Heavyweight winner Forrest Griffin at \"UFC 66\". Although considered an underdog in the bout, Jardine scored a TKO victory in the first round after he floored Forrest then took the full guard and brought many right hands over the top to cause the stoppage. At \"UFC 71\", Jardine was scheduled to fight UFC newcomer Houston Alexander. During his pre-fight interview, Jardine complained about being matched against an unknown newcomer, believing that he deserved an opponent with a higher profile. During the fight, Jardine quickly knocked Alexander down with a punch, but the newcomer promptly returned to his feet and knocked Jardine out just 48 seconds into the first round in a major upset.\n\nJardine was then matched up against former long-time UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, Chuck Liddell at \"UFC 76\". The bout was Liddell's first fight since losing his belt to Quinton Jackson. Jardine landed numerous unchecked leg kicks and several body kicks to Liddell's side throughout the fight, which was spent almost totally on the feet. The bout was ruled a split decision in Jardine's favor, turning him into a top contender for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. First, however, Jardine faced former PRIDE Middleweight Champion Wanderlei Silva. Silva swarmed Jardine with punches and knocked him out just 36 seconds into the first round. Jardine had to be helped up after the fight and was sent to the local hospital for observation.\n\nAfter this loss, Jardine faced Brandon Vera at \"UFC 89\". Although it appeared that Vera damaged Jardine's knee with a front kick in the second round, Jardine ultimately earned a split decision victory over Vera. In a post-fight interview, Jardine stated that the injury was minor. With the victory, Jardine earned a shot at Quinton Jackson at \"UFC 96\". Although the fight was considered an elimination bout for title contention, Jardine and former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Rashad Evans are close friends and training partners and both have stated that they will not fight each other. In a close fight, Jardine lost by unanimous decision. The bout was the Fight of the Night earning them a $60,000 bonus. Jardine was the last man to fight Jackson before his temporary retirement.\n\nJardine was knocked out by Thiago Silva at \"UFC 102\" 1:35 in the first round.\n\nJardine suffered his second consecutive knockout and third straight loss at the hands of Ryan Bader on February 21, 2010, at UFC 110. After being rocked by a straight right from Bader, he received a flying knee to the ribs and then a hook punch to the chin that knocked him out, two minutes into the third round.\n\nJardine faced Matt Hamill on June 19, 2010, at . He lost the fight via majority decision, in a bout that earned \"Fight of the Night\" honors. Subsequently, he was released by the UFC on June 24, 2010.\n\nJardine's first fight since leaving the UFC was against Shark Fights Light Heavyweight Champion Trevor Prangley in a non-title bout at \"\" on September 11, 2010. Jardine lost to Prangley via split decision, bringing his losing streak to five-in-a-row. After the fight he was given an indefinite suspension by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation for shoving referee Steve Armstrong prior to the fight.\n\nJardine was scheduled to face Francisco France at on November 13, 2010, but the event was postponed to avoid a storm. The new date for the event was December 10, 2010.\n\nJardine defeated Francisco via unanimous decision and snapped his five fight losing streak. The win at Nemesis was surrounded by controversy, as there were no judges at the event. Jardine and other fighters on the card were also never paid by the promotion.\n\nJardine next took on MFC veteran Aron Lofton in an event near Albuquerque, New Mexico. Jardine was victorious via TKO (punches) at 3:30 of the first round.\n\nJardine signed with Strikeforce as a late replacement for the injured Mike Kyle to face Gegard Mousasi on the April 9th card in San Diego. The hard-fought fight ultimately ended in a majority draw due to Mousasi being docked one point in the first round for an illegal upkick. Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker has stated a rematch may be in the cards in the near future.\n\nJardine stated that after his fight with Mousasi, he will drop down to the Middleweight division and that he wants to fight former Strikeforce Middleweight Champion Cung Le.\n\nJardine faced Luke Rockhold for the Strikeforce Middleweight Championship at on January 7, 2012. He lost the fight via TKO in the first round.\n\nJardine next faced Roger Gracie at on July 14 and lost via unanimous decision after being cut open in the first round by an elbow from mount by Gracie.\n\nIn an interview with MMA Fight Corner, Jardine described himself as \"semi-retired\" and is unsure if he will return to the cage.\n\nJardine has fought four bouts as a professional boxer. His professional boxing record is three wins with one draw. His last boxing bout was a draw against Jason Cordova that took place on August 20, 2004.\n\nIn 2009, Jardine appeared in the movies \"\" (starring Jason Statham) and \"Gamer\" (starring Gerard Butler). He was also featured in the \"Breaking Bad\" (starring fellow Canoga Park High School Alumnus Bryan Cranston) Season 3 episode \"I.F.T\", where he played a criminal who gets into a bar fight. He has appeared in small roles in various other films such as \"Tactical Force\", \"Beer For My Horses\", \"Unrivaled\" and \"Death Warrior\". On February 11, 2013, he starred in the Hawaii Five-O episode titled, \"Kekoa\". In 2014, he appeared in the movies \"John Wick\", \"Inherent Vice\" and \"Shot Caller\". In 2016, he appears in \"Preacher\". He plays one of Odin's employees, named Verne, first appearing in the episode \"SEE\", seen playing poker. The Dean of Mean makes a brief cameo in \"Once Upon a Time in Venice\", where he clobbers Bruce Willis's character after failing to repay a debt. Jardine has also worked in Netflix content, playing Dyer Howe, a member of Frank Griffin's gang, in the series \"Godless\", released in November 2017, appearing in the film \"Bird Box\", released in December 2018, and appearing in Season 2, episode 5 of the series \"The Punisher\".\n\nHe portrays Pete in Vincent D'Onofrio 2019 film \"The Kid\".\n\nJardine is currently engaged to MMA Women's Atomweight fighter Jodie Esquibel, who was a contestant on .\n\n\n!\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Method\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Location\n!Notes\n\n", "id": "7705535", "categories": ["Mixed martial artists from New Mexico", "Light heavyweight mixed martial artists", "Sportspeople from Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Living people", "1975 births", "American male mixed martial artists"], "title": "Keith Jardine"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7705538", "text": "Air Corps Tactical School\n\nThe Air Corps Tactical School, also known as ACTS and \"the Tactical School\", was a military professional development school for officers of the United States Army Air Service and United States Army Air Corps, the first such school in the world. Created in 1920 at Langley Field, Virginia, it relocated to Maxwell Field, Alabama, in July 1931. Instruction at the school was suspended in 1940, anticipating the entry of the United States into World War II, and the school was dissolved shortly after. ACTS was replaced in November 1942 by the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics.\n\nIn addition to the training of officers in more than 20 areas of military education, the school became the doctrine development center of the Air Corps, and a preparatory school for Air Corps officers aspiring to attendance at the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff College. The motto of the Air Corps Tactical School was \"Proficimus More Irretenti\"—\"We Make Progress Unhindered by Custom\".\n\nThe Air Corps Tactical School was notable as the birthplace of the Army Air Forces doctrine of daylight precision bombing. This doctrine held that a campaign of daylight air attacks against critical targets of a potential enemy's industrial infrastructure, using long-range bombers heavily armed for self-defense, could defeat an enemy nation even though its army and navy remained intact. The Tactical School, in formulating the doctrine, rejected the idea of attacking civilians.\n\nFour former instructors of the school, the core of a group known as the \"Bomber Mafia\", were grouped together in the Air War Plans Division to produce the two war-winning plans—AWPD-1 and AWPD-42—based on the doctrine of precision daylight bombing that guided the wartime expansion and deployment of the Army Air Forces.\n\nIn a broader sense, the strategic bombing doctrine, adapted by factors encountered during combat, was also the foundation for the final separation of the Air Force from the Army as a military service independent of and equal to the other services. In 1946 the AAF created the Air University to carry on the work and traditions of the ACTS.\n\nAt the end of World War I, observation remained the main role of the Air Service. However, air combat and limited bombardment operations indicated to veterans of the Air Service, including Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell, that while ideally the service should be separate from the Army, it at the least should be centralized under an Air Service commander with some missions independent of direct support of troops. In reorganizing the post-war Army, the Armed Forces Reorganization Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 759) rebuked these ideas but did establish the Air Service as a statutory entity (previously it had existed by executive order only) and assigned it status as a \"combatant arm of the line.\"\n\nThe Air Service followed the precedent of the other combat arms and began planning for its own service schools. An \"Air Service School of Application\" for technical training in aeronautical engineering, similar to the Ordnance School of Application at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, was set up at McCook Field, and began its first class 10 November 1919. Maj. Gen. Charles Menoher, Director of Air Service, wrote the War Department in October 1919 for permission to establish a tactical school at Langley Field, Virginia, to train field grade officers in the operation and tactics of the Air Service as a requirement for higher command or staff work.\n\nOn 25 February 1920, the War Department authorized the Air Service to establish its service schools. In addition to six pilot and advanced pilot training schools, and two technical training schools, an Air Service School was planned. It proposed to host courses for enlisted personnel as balloon observers, balloon mechanics, and aerial photography, but its main course was to be the Field Officers Course.\n\nMajor Thomas DeWitt Milling was assigned as officer-in-charge of the Field Officers Course at the new school and sent to Langley in July 1920 to set it up. War Department General Order No. 18 authorized the school on 14 August 1920. The balloon courses were split off into a separate school in a different area of Langley and the Air Service School was renamed the Air Service Field Officers School on 10 February 1921, after its primary function. The Air Service ordered 17 officers to Langley, eight as students and nine as instructors, although several officers swapped roles and some instructors were students as well. The 1920–1921 class opened on 1 November 1920, and although scheduled to last nine months, was concluded in May when both students and instructors were assigned to the 1st Provisional Air Brigade, as part of by the Air Service and the United States Navy. 11 officers, including four instructors, graduated the first course. The second class, beginning in October 1921, was devoted to the further training of instructors, the creation of a sound administrative system, and development of a well-rounded course curriculum.\n\nIn the first two classes, despite the school's title and function, only six of the first 23 graduates were field grade officers. A board reviewing all service schools of the United States Army observed that the Field Officers School had a course load that in other branches of the Army was distributed among several schools. Because all other Air Service schools were technical training in nature, the board recommended that the school be opened to all air service officers regardless of rank. Accordingly, Army regulations changed the name of the school to that of Air Service Tactical School on 8 November 1922. With the passage of the Air Corps Act of 1926, the school again changed its name, becoming the Air Corps Tactical School on 2 July 1926.\n\nWhile at Langley, the ACTS was hampered by a chronic shortage of instructors, caused by a lack of policy within the Army for filling vacancies despite a rapid turnover in staff in the first three years. School administrators were forced to double as instructors. The situation was somewhat ameliorated in August 1924 when the Chief of the Air Service authorized extended duty for instructors, most of whom afterwards served four-year tours on the faculty, with an overlap between incoming and outgoing staff. Between 1925 and 1929 the number of instructors gradually doubled to 16 but even that number proved insufficient to research the vast collection of aviation literature the school's library was collecting to establish doctrine.\n\nDespite school recommendations to the contrary, class size gradually increased, reaching 40 students by 1931. The first student from a branch other than the Air Service (an infantry officer) attended ASTS in 1923–1924. This became standard when the 1926–1927 class had five officers representing the other combat branches of the United States Army and three from the United States Marine Corps assigned as students.\n\nThe functioning of the school was also handicapped by a lack of permanent facilities, especially in quarters, and the school did not have a permanent academic building. When the five-year expansion program outlined in the Air Corps Act of 1926 failed to address these problems, and the creation of new units at Langley interrupted the functioning of the practical flying course, the Air Service began seeking a new location for the Tactical School.\n\nThe 1930–1931 class was the last at Langley. In its eleven years at Langley, the Tactical School graduated 221 students.\n\nThe academic curriculum was standardized in 1922 by the Army's board tasked with preparing \"programs of instruction\" for all Army schools. 1,345 hours of instruction in 20 subjects, taught over a nine-month period beginning on or about 1 September of each school year, included approximately 900 hours of tactics, including those of other services and combined arms tactics, although more than half (480 hours) were devoted to air tactics in observation, bombardment, pursuit, and attack aviation. Approximately 290 hours involved technical subjects, including aeronautical engineering, armament and gunnery, navigation, meteorology, and photography, and 150 to administrative studies, covering staff duties, combat orders, organization of the Army, military and international law, supply and courses in equitation and stable management.\n\nThe curriculum was altered in July 1923 by the newly created Director of Instruction, Capt. Earl Naiden, cutting the academic course by 500 hours to 845 total hours. 450 hours of the cuts came from the various tactics subjects, although the equitation courses were also eliminated, and all academic courses were scheduled in mornings. Naiden added courses in the history of the Air Service and map reading to the academics, and a 126-hour afternoon course in practical flying, instituted to provide refresher training to pilots but required of all students, including those of non-aviation branches. The course structure remained the same until 1939, with changes only in individual course subjects, averaging 25 hours per week of classroom study and 3.7 hours weekly of flying.\n\nThe first printed texts covering air tactics replaced mimeographed texts in 1924. This development of the tactics portion of the school led to increased emphasis, and in 1925 aeronautical engineering was eliminated from the curriculum. Theoretical use of airpower was first advanced in 1928, and beginning in 1929 a new course was taught at the end of each class, \"The Air Force\", coordinating all air topics covered during the year.\n\nArmy regulations also made the commander of the 2nd Wing, as the base commander at Langley, the commandant of the Tactical School. However, during its first four years this caused little disruption as Milling, first as officer in charge and then as assistant commandant, remained in actual charge of the school. In 1924 Maj. Oscar Westover became the first commandant to exercise control over school activities. The assistant commandant then became responsible for academics, assisted by the director of instruction, directors of the individual academic departments, and the school secretary (formerly the school adjutant).\n\nCourse instruction assumed a pattern combining both theory and practical instruction. Subjects were generally scheduled in blocks, particularly tactics, beginning with those of other branches and services, along with logistics and staff functions, from the beginning of each class until December. The courses in air tactics followed, described by one student as coming with \"bewildering rapidity.\"\n\nPractical instruction came in the form of \"field problems,\" initiated in the classroom, then demonstrated and practiced in the practical flying course. Annual inspection trips were also undertaken until 1930 to the Engineering Division at McCook and Wright Fields in Dayton, Ohio, when trips began to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. Beginning in 1924, ACTS students also participated in the annual Army War College maneuvers at Ft. DuPont, Delaware. However, by 1931 doctrinal disagreements between the schools and the exclusion of ACTS staff from the planning process created a perceived misuse of airpower on the part of AWC planners that ACTS assistant commandant Maj. John F. Curry criticized as not being of value to students of either school. Although Air Corps input resulted in some improvements, a lack of funds eliminated ACTS participation after 1933.\n\nDifficulties with dilapidated facilities at Langley were not resolved, and a proposed relocation to Staten Island was rejected by the staff for lack of year-round flying weather, urban restrictions on flying, and a lack of support facilities. Locations at Bolling Field, Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Virginia; San Antonio, Texas; Fort Riley, Kansas; and another area of Langley Field were studied before the choice was made of Maxwell Field, a depot in Montgomery, Alabama, as the site for the school.\n\nPlans were developed for a campus to accommodate a tactical school of 75 students, a squadron officers school of 50 junior officer students, and a school demonstration flying group of four squadrons. Congress appropriated almost $700,000 by July 1929 for new buildings, including Building 800-Austin Hall to house the Tactical School, and $200,000 to purchase acreage on which to build new officer quarters. Delays in construction caused two postponements of the relocation until June 1931, when Austin Hall was completed. On 15 July 1931, the school completed its move, although officer quarters were not begun until 1932. Architects commissioned by the Quartermaster Corps designed 99 residences for officers in an elegant style they deemed \"French Provencial,\" and placed them in a neighborhood setting that became \"the showplace of the Air Corps.\" The construction program at Maxwell continued until 1938, funded primarily by the WPA and PWA. A bombing and gunnery range was also set up near Valparaiso, Florida, for Tactical School use.\n\nIn 1934 Curry, now ACTS Commandant, reorganized the academic structure of the school along functional lines into three principal departments: Air Tactics, Ground Tactics, and Basic and Special Instruction. Flying was a fourth department. The \"Air Force\", \"Attack\", \"Bombardment\", \"Pursuit\", and \"Observation\" sections were placed within the Department of Air Tactics. The next year these departments became the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy, Department of Ground Tactics, and Department of Command, Staff and Logistics.\n\nFour faculty committees were also established to administrate scheduling, the school library, and publication of doctrine. The Air Corps Board, which had been inactive since the move from Langley, was permanently relocated to Maxwell in 1933. Restructured by the Tactical School faculty, who doubled as its members, the Board was directed by the War Department to formulate Air Corps doctrine. The Board became indistinguishable from the Tactical School and undertook 77 projects between 1935 and 1942, a third of which dealt with tactical doctrine, and the remainder with equipment, armaments, field manuals, and training texts.\n\nAfter the move to Maxwell, the practice of requiring students to fly actual missions as part of the instruction process was discontinued for safety reasons. Plans for a composite school group were suspended by the Chief of the Air Corps because of a service-wide shortage of personnel and aircraft, and attempts to have demonstrations by existing combat units were mostly unsatisfactory. The demonstration group was not authorized until August 1939 and was utilized for less than a year before classes were suspended.\n\nIn 1938 the Department of Flying Instruction was dissolved and its functions parceled out to the remaining departments. The Department of Air Tactics and Strategy became the dominant division at the school, and its Air Force Section the most important course, in which airpower theories were presented and explored, doctrine emerging as much from the students as from the faculty.\n\nAssociation with the Infantry School increased, but inspection trips formerly used at Langley first became voluntary and then were discontinued. Only a handful of graduates had gone on to attend the Command and General Staff School, and as a result the Tactical School ended its role as a preparatory school. Instead the ACTS became the equivalent for Air Corps officers of C&GSS, and increased the emphasis on air subjects to more than half of the total course hours by 1934–1935, with an accompanying decrease in hours for ground and administrative subjects. Classroom studies were similarly altered. Lectures occupied only half of a classroom hour, with the remainder given over to discussion and debate of concepts presented and of alternative ideas.\n\nThe limited class size at the Tactical School led the Air Corps in 1938 to study the feasibility of using a series of shorter courses to allow a greater number of officers to attend. The study concluded that a significant number of potential staff and command officers had not attended the school and was growing annually. It recommended that the nine-month course be discontinued for a year and four 12-week courses scheduled, each having 100 students, all drawn from the group of prospective senior staff.\n\nThe plan had the drawbacks of limiting the amount of detail to which students could be exposed, and would require a rebuilding of the staff and curriculum when the long course was reinstated. Nevertheless, the curriculum was changed from 712 academic hours to 298. The short courses began on 1 June 1939, and continued for the next year.\n\nIn its first years, the Tactical School taught that pursuit aviation was the most important of air operations, epitomized by the 1925–1926 class text \"Employment of Combined Air Force\" that compared the importance of pursuit to the Air Service to that of infantry to the Army. However, in 1926 the Tactical School modified this principle by asserting for the first time that airpower could strike at vital points deep inside enemy territory rather than merely targeting an enemy's military forces in a war of attrition. By 1931 the Tactical School was teaching that \"a determined air attack, once launched, is most difficult, if not impossible to stop.\" This shift in emphasis from pursuit to bombardment was the result of two factors: the air war theories of the time and the state of aviation technology.\n\nDevotees of Billy Mitchell, many of whom had served with the 1st Provisional Air Brigade, dominated the faculty of the Tactical School at Maxwell. With their students, they developed a theory of warfare that invoked the superiority of the long-range bomber over all other types of aircraft. Going beyond Mitchell's ideas, they de-emphasized balanced forces and support of ground troops in favor of a doctrine that heavily armed bombers could fight their way to industrial targets in daylight, unescorted by fighters, and with precision bombing (made possible by the introduction of the Norden bombsight in 1931), defeat an enemy by destroying key war production targets, rather than engaging in costly and prolonged ground campaigns aimed at destroying enemy armies. While the theory was based on tenets of strategic airpower developed by Mitchell, Hugh Trenchard, and Giulio Douhet, it rejected the concept of terror-bombing of civil populations as a means of destroying the morale and coercing the will of an enemy state.\n\nThe formulators of this doctrine were relatively young junior officers, nearly all of them former reservists commissioned during or immediately after World War I. They viewed war in the abstract, admitted (and even apologized for) being unable to offer conclusive proof of their theories, but firmly believed that the dominance of airpower lay ahead in the future, when existing limitations of technology had been overcome. Nine key advocates, all of whom instructed at the Tactical School, became known as the \"Bomber Mafia.\" The unofficial leader of the group was the bombardment section chief and later director of the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy, Major Harold L. George.\n\nThe doctrine brought them in conflict with the Army General Staff, which did not view airpower as a major striking arm but as an auxiliary to the ground forces. Despite the poor performance of what few bombers the Air Corps possessed, the air theorists persisted in their beliefs, testifying in favor of a separate air force before commissions set up in the wake of the Air Mail scandal.\n\nAlthough flawed and tested only under optimal conditions, the doctrine (originally known as the \"industrial web theory\") became the primary airpower strategy of the United States in the planning for World War II. Four former instructors of the school, the core of the \"Bomber Mafia\", produced the two airpower war plans (AWPD-1 and AWPD-42) that guided the wartime expansion and deployment of the Army Air Forces.\n\nThe doctrine was not universally held among air officers, however. Claire L. Chennault, chief of the pursuit section between 1931 and 1936, reasoned that the same technology that would increase the performance of the bomber would also eventually enable the single-engine fighter to challenge the bomber at high altitude, which it could not do in the years when the daylight bombing doctrine was formulated. Combined with a centralized early warning and control system (which came with the development of radar), defending interceptors would inflict serious losses on unescorted forces. The doctrine also ran counter to the theories of Billy Mitchell, who believed that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations.\n\nChennault, however, also had a blind spot in his zealous advocacy of fighters as the offensive weapon of the Air Corps. He consciously avoided acknowledging the role of accompanying escort fighters as part of an offensive air strike. When his tour at ACTS ended, the fighter-versus-bomber controversy became a moot point among the staff, to the detriment of developing a role for escort fighters.\n\nAlthough the proponents of daylight precision bombing at the Tactical School had a \"failure of imagination\" in not expanding the doctrine to include establishing air superiority as a prerequisite for success, and thus contributed to the delay in the development of a long-range escort fighter until two years into the war, the doctrine nonetheless became the foundation for the separation of the Air Force from the Army, and the basis for modern airpower theory. ACTS graduate, instructor, and \"Bomber Mafia\" member Haywood S. Hansell, concurred that both the theorists and the authors of the AWPD-1 war plan (he was both) made a serious mistake in neglecting long-range fighter escort in their ideas. Hansell wrote:\n\nIt was recognized that fighter escort was inherently desirable, but no one could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of the bomber yet retain its combat maneuverability. Failure to see this issue through proved one of the Air Corps Tactical School's major shortcomings.\n\nHowever he also stated that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential to the creation of the United States Air Force. Development of fighters was not ignored; by October 1940, over a year before Pearl Harbor, every type of piston-driven single-engine fighter used by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in World War II had made its first flight except the P-47 Thunderbolt. However, the press of the enormous tasks confronting the Air Corps and the primacy of strategic bombing doctrine meant that development of a long-range capability for these new fighters was not undertaken until combat losses to bombers forced the issue.\n\nBefore the short courses began, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for an expansion of the Air Corps in January 1939. The need for experienced officers to supervise the expansion led to plans to reduce the size of the faculty and long course classes as a compromise to keep the school functioning. Six of the 24 Air Corps instructors would be returned to regular duty and class sizes would be reduced from 60 to 20 students. However World War II in Europe began on 1 September 1939, before the staff and class reductions could be implemented. The Air Corps permitted the short courses to be finished, but suspended all instruction on 30 June 1940. The Tactical School was reduced to a caretaker staff of seven officers, including two librarians.\n\nOne year later the Tactical School came under the control of the Southeast Air Corps Training Center, headquartered at Maxwell, with the objective of re-opening the school immediately. After completion of a study, the center recommended in July 1941 that the Tactical School curriculum be modified into a ten-week basic course in tactics for squadron and group level junior grade officers, to instruct 2,000 officers its first year and 5,000 officers thereafter, ending its twin missions of senior officer service school and doctrine development center. Instead the Air Corps Board was moved to Eglin Field, Florida and absorbed by the Air Corps Proving Ground, while all remaining staff of the Tactical School were transferred to Washington, D.C., where they continued work (mainly the production of training literature) until 30 June 1942, after which the school went unstaffed until its formal dissolution in 1946.\n\nThe ACTS at Maxwell graduated 870 officers, 400 of them in the short courses. During its entire history, the Tactical School trained 1,091 officers, 916 of them in the Air Service or Air Corps. 158 graduates from other arms included 118 Army officers, 35 Marines, and five Naval officers. The Tactical School also trained 17 officers from foreign countries. Of the 320 general officers in the Army Air Forces at the end of World War II, 261 were Tactical School graduates, including 14 of the 18 highest-ranking AAF generals. 134 officers (including 21 from the Army and Navy) served on the faculty of the Tactical School during its 20 years of existence, 58 of whom became general officers.\n\nThe senior service school function was abandoned for the duration of World War II in favor of development of an actual tactical center, responsible for the mass teaching of all aspects of air warfare to inexperienced officers who would become commanders of newly created units. Although commandants at ACTS had lobbied throughout its existence for the Tactical School to serve as the nucleus of such a center, it instead became the function of a new school, the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics, activated 27 October 1942, in Orlando, Florida, both for the training of unit cadres and the continuing development of tactical doctrine.\n\nThe experiences of World War II created a new impetus for professional education of air commanders, as it had after World War I, but on a much vaster scale. The expectation of becoming a separate service from the Army resulted in planning for a service-wide educational system, the nucleus of which would be the Air University. Established in 1946, AU coordinated all professional education for Air Force officers, and \"fell heir to the purpose and tradition of the old Tactical School\".\n\n\"Without students\":\n\n\n\n", "id": "7705538", "categories": ["United States Air Force", "Military education and training in the United States"], "title": "Air Corps Tactical School"}

Waterman was working as a pen salesman in New York for a new company founded in the spring of 1883 by a volatile inventor named Frank Holland. Holland abandoned his company after only six weeks; Waterman stepped in and took over, fitting the pens with a simplified feed of his own design. It was for this \"three fissure feed\" which his first pen-related patent was granted in 1884.\n\nFollowing his death in Brooklyn in 1901, his nephew Frank D. Waterman took the business overseas and increased sales to 350,000 pens per year.\n\nWaterman was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.\nThere has been a great deal of mythologizing of Waterman's life and career. The tale that he was prompted to invent a better fountain pen upon losing an insurance sale after the contract was spoiled by an ink blot left by a balky fountain pen has been widely repeated, but is completely unfounded.\n\nWaterman was born in Decatur, New York. His father was a wagon maker who died when Lewis was three. The boy grew up on his stepfather's farm, attending the district school until he was fifteen, then attending the seminary at Charlottesville, New York for some three months. Still fifteen, he began teaching, supplementing his income by carpentry work. Waterman chiefly taught Pitman shorthand (\"stenography\"), which took him to Illinois and Virginia.\n\nWaterman began selling insurance in 1862, starting in Michigan but relocating to Boston in 1864. In the late 1860s Waterman and his wife Sara Ann Roberts were converted to Spiritualism; his wife gained some fame (and income) as a medium, only to be unmasked and publicly pilloried as a charlatan. In the wake of this and the death of an infant daughter in the summer of 1870, Waterman left his wife and remaining children and moved to New York. In New York, Waterman attended lectures at the American Institute of Phrenology, from which he graduated that same year. Waterman remained keen on phrenology until the end of his life. By 1871 he was promoting the \"Reactionary Lifter\", a form of weight training machine. Waterman remarried in 1872, and was back in the insurance business in Boston from 1875 to 1877. A few years later he was on the move again, working as editor for railroad journals \"The Railroad Gazette\" and \"National Car Builder\". It appears that it was during this period that Waterman began to sell fountain pens, not of his manufacture. Near the end of his life, Waterman started the Waterman Condensing Company to make fruit extracts, but this venture lasted only a few years.\n\n", "id": "7705542", "categories": ["19th-century American inventors", "1837 births", "American businesspeople"], "title": "Lewis Waterman"}

In cities and towns, the bigger and more expensive looking the kite, the more people can usually be seen running after it to try to capture it as their free prize.\n\nDroves of people of all ages may run after a kite and try to capture it with the help of poles or broken off tree branches with which they try to entangle the loose string trailing with the kite. Running after and capturing these kites is often made more difficult when these drifting kites are taken long distances with the wind or fall atop trees, electric poles and houses over compound walls and fences, or in the middle of or across busy roads and railway lines.\n\nKite runners endanger their lives by running into the path of oncoming traffic and trains without looking down or fall from trees and buildings which they were trying to scale to get at kites that landed on top while gazing up and running after kites. They may walk around in the middle of congested towns and cities and while gazing up may be dangerously unaware of what is happening on the ground in their immediate surroundings causing injuries and collisions with traffic.\n\nThere have also been incidents with glass-coated kite strings causing injuries or damage where other people, birds, or electricity cables get entangled with the string. In particular, it is liable to slitting the throats of children participating in the Market Sankranti festival where a popular challenge is to cut other kite strings with your own.

During this time, he led the colony through King George's War. He had an extensive military career throughout his life, during the events of British and French conflict that led to the Seven Years' War (the North American theater is known as the French and Indian War).\n\nMascarene was of French birth of a Huguenot family, driven from France at the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. Subsequently, Mascarene was cared for by relatives in Geneva where he was raised and received his education.\n\nAbout 1706 he moved to England where he received an ensigncy/a badge in the Regiment of French Foot. He was stationed at Portsmouth in 1708 where he was commissioned a lieutenant. By “having the advantage of the French language”, the Governor of Nova Scotia, Samuel Vetch took an interest in Mascarene to use him in relations with French speaking inhabitants of his territory. In 1711, Mascarene was posted at Boston, Massachusetts, where he met and married Elizabeth Perry, by whom he would have four children. In August 1714, Vetch sent Mascarene and Captain Joseph Bennett, with a detachment of troops to Minas, located in the Grand-Pré region of Nova Scotia, Canada. Mascarene’s orders were to be courteous but to collect a tribute worth 6,000 \"livres\" from the Acadian inhabitants. Vetch appointed him with a committee, to hear and settle disputes between the Acadians. During the next five years, Mascarene divided his time between Boston and Placentia, Newfoundland, where he was in charge of an infantry company.\n\nBy August 1717, he was commissioned a captain in the newly formed 40th Regiment of Foot and put in charge of a grenadier company. When Port Royal, Nova Scotia was surrendered in October, he “had the honour to take possession of it in mounting the first guard.” Whether by formal education or breadth of interests, he was considered an engineer as well as a regular officer and artilleryman, and a visit to England during this period resulted in his appointment as engineer to the Board of Ordnance. By 1719, he was back in Boston preparing to embark for Annapolis with orders to report on the state of the fortifications there. \n\nHe was commissioned Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia in 1740, until he was replaced by Edward Cornwallis in 1749. \nIn 1751, the new governor, Cornwallis, sent Mascarene to New England to renew the 1726 treaty with the eastern Indians (Norridgewocks, Penobscots, Malecites), and although he corresponded with his Annapolis friends for several years, he did not return to Nova Scotia.\n\nIn the course of service, he rose to the rank of Major-General. \nHe died poor having only half the pay of his lieutenant-colonelcy to sustain his remaining days in Boston.\nNonetheless, he was content with his family of whom he expressed “thanks to Almighty God [to be] in my own house amongst my Children and . . . grandchildren.” (Two of his grandchildren, Hon Foster Hutchinson and William Handfield Snelling, both buried in the Old Burying Ground.)\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7705589", "categories": ["40th Regiment of Foot officers", "1684 births", "People from Castres", "South Lancashire Regiment officers", "Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada)", "English army officers", "1760 deaths", "Governors of the Colony of Nova Scotia"], "title": "Paul Mascarene"}

Marie, Ottawa, Sarnia, and 2 from Toronto.\n\nThe Spartans began play in 1954 as Charter Members of the Northern Ontario Rugby-Football Union (predecessor to the NFC) Originally named \"Hardrocks\" to reflect the Sudbury's predominant mining industry, the moniker was changed to \"Spartans\" in 1967 by then rookie head coach Sid Forster. Forster, a member of the 1953 team who was inducted in the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2001, felt the old name sounded more like a street gang than a football team.\n\nFollowing the death of Forster in 1994, the team struggled to remain competitive. It faced several winless seasons in which it could not finish above .500. During this period, it fielded teams as small as 20 men.

It had become the most popular participation sport in local high schools. The Joe Macdonald Youth Football league was flourishing, the high school league bursting at the seams and the Sudbury Gladiators of the Ontario Football Conference had enjoyed a few seasons of success on the gridiron. This resulted in a number of graduated Gladiator players looking to continue playing summer football.\n\nThe Sudbury Spartan executive were approached by this group and after challenging the football players in Sudbury to commit to playing summer ball by pre-registering for the 2011 NFC season- an abundance of players answered the call and signed up and paid their team fees to play for the Spartans during the upcoming 2011 NFC season. Having answered the call to commit- Spartan President and former head coach Gord Goddard brought together a new Spartan Team Executive and began the process of re-entry into the NFC as a member club.\n\nThe Sudbury Spartans have been welcomed back into the Northern Football Conference. On Saturday November 20, 2010, the member clubs of the NFC gave the Spartans conditional acceptance back into the league. Official approval will come January 22, 2011 at the NFC Annual General Meeting in Ottawa.\n\nOn January 22, 2011, the Sudbury Spartans were granted official and full membership back into the Northern Football Conference.\n\nAfter a 4-year leave of absence – the Spartans return to the gridiron for the first time since 2006.

She was known for her numerous inventions dealing with sewing machines and sewing technology.\n\nBlanchard was born in Portland, Maine on October 25, 1840 to a wealthy family. Her father was Nathaniel Blanchard, a shipowner and businessman; her mother was Phoebe Buxton Blanchard. Helen was one of six children; two other daughters Louise Phobe, and Persis E., and three sons David H., Augustus, and Albus. Helen demonstrated an inventive turn of mind at an early age, but did not receive her first patent until she was over thirty, after the fall of her father's business. There is no indication that she received any mechanical or technical education, despite her patents being involved mostly in these subjects.\n\nHer father suffered financial losses as a result of the business panic of 1866, resulting in the loss of the family homestead. Nathaniel died, leaving his family with financial troubles. Helen Blanchard moved to Boston, Massachusetts and patented several inventions relating to sewing machines in 1873 and 1875. This included the Blanchard over-seaming-machine, which could simultaneously sew and trim knitted fabrics.\n\nAfter developing techniques for zigzag stitching and overseaming, Blanchard moved to Philadelphia, where she established the Blanchard Overseaming Company of Philadelphia to market her inventions in the late 1870s or early 1880s. She also founded the Blanchard Hosiery Machine Company in 1882. She moved to New York in the early 1890s, and continued to patent a variety of inventions, including a pencil sharpener and a hat sewing machine.\n\nHaving profited from her commercial ventures, Blanchard was able to buy back the family homestead in Portland, and moved back there in 1901. She continued to patent inventions until suffering a stroke in 1916. She died in Providence, RI, in 1922 and is buried in the family plot in Portland’s Evergreen Cemetery. . It is unclear what became of her property and wealth after her death. However, she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nHelen Blanchard received 28 patents over about 45 years, 22 of which involved sewing and sewing machines.

The implications of this point are worked out on topics such as market economics, child rights, environmentalism, feminism, foreign policy, redistribution and others.\n\nRoy Childs writes in the Foreword:\nFor until Rothbard's work is carefully studied by every advocate of liberty, the value of his contributions to the libertarian system cannot be fully appreciated and, moreover, the unity and true historical context of libertarianism will not even be fully grasped.\n\n\n", "id": "7705752", "categories": ["Books in political philosophy", "Political books", "1974 books", "Books about capitalism", "Sociology books", "Books by Murray Rothbard", "Economic ideologies", "Egalitarianism"], "title": "Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7705764", "text": "Intel MCS-96\n\nThe Intel MCS-96 is a family of microcontrollers (MCU) commonly used in embedded systems. The family is often referred to as the 8xC196 family, or 80196, the most popular MCU in the family. These MCUs are commonly used in hard disk drives, modems, printers, pattern recognition and motor control. In 2007, Intel announced the discontinuance of the entire MCS-96 family of microcontrollers. Intel noted that \"There are no direct replacements for these components and a redesign will most likely be necessary.\"\n\nThe MCS-96 family originated as a commercial derivative of the Intel 8061, the first processor in the Ford EEC-IV engine controller family. Differences between the 8061 and the 8096 include the memory interface bus, the 8061's M-Bus being a 'burst-mode' bus requiring a tracking program counter in the memory devices. There were also considerable differences in the I/O peripherals of the two parts – the 8061 had 8 HSI (pulse-measurement) inputs, 10 HSO (pulse-generation) outputs entirely separated from the HSI pins, and a non-sampling 10-bit ADC with more channels than the 8096 had. Many differences between the EEC-IV and the 8096 resulted from an effort to share pins to reduce I/O pin count in favor of using the pins for a more conventional memory interface bus. The 8096 also had on-chip program memory lacking in the 8061.\n\nFord created the Ford Microelectronics facility in Colorado Springs in 1982 to propagate the EEC-IV family, develop other custom circuits for use in automobiles, and to explore the gallium arsenide integrated circuit market. Parts in that family included the 8065, which incorporated a memory controller allowing it to address a megabyte of memory.\n\nThe family of microcontrollers are 16-bit, however they do have some 32-bit operations. The processors operate at 16, 20, 25, and 50 MHz, and is separated into 3 smaller families. The HSI (high speed input) / HSO (high speed output) family operates at 16 and 20 MHz, and the EPA (event processor array) family operates at all of the frequencies.\n\nThe main features of the MCS-96 family include a large on-chip memory, Register-to-register architecture, three operand instructions, bus controller to allow 8 or 16 bit bus widths, and direct flat addressability of large blocks (256 or more) of registers.\n\nThe 809x/839x/879x ICs are members of the MCS-96 family. Although MCS-96 is thought of as the 8x196 family, the 8095 was the first member of the family. Later the 8096, 8097, 8395, 8396, and 8397 were added to the family.\n\nThe Intel 809x/839x/879x ICs are 12 MHz, 16 bit microcontrollers. The microchip is based on a 5 V, 3 micrometre, HMOS process. The microcontroller has an on-chip ALU, 4 channel 10 bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), 8 bit pulse width modulator (PWM), watchdog timer, 4 16bit software timers, hardware multiply and divide, and 8 KB of on-chip ROM. The 8095 is ROMless and has five 8-bit high speed I/O, full duplex serial port, as well as an ADC input and PWM output.\n\nThe 8095 comes in a 48-pin Ceramic DIP package, and the following part number variants. C8095-90 \n\nThe MCS-96 family is generally thought of as the 80C196 IC, even though the family includes the 809x/839x/879x microcontrollers, which came first. Members of this sub-family are 80C196, 83C196, 87C196 and 88C196.\n\nAs of 2017, microcontrollers using the MCS-96 architecture are still being manufactured by NIIET in Voronesh, Russia, as the 1874 series of integrated circuits. This includes a radiation-hardened device with a Spacewire interface under the designation 1874VE7T (). Cobham (formerly Aeroflex) manufactures another radiation-hardened MCS-96 microcontroller.\n\n\n", "id": "7705764", "categories": [], "title": "Intel MCS-96"}

Historically, the term has been used primarily in the United States to describe a person of color or multiracial ancestry who has assimilated into the white majority during times when legal and social conventions of hypodescent classified the person as a minority, subject to racial segregation and discrimination, regardless of their actual ancestry. \n\nTo fully understand how some African-American people pass as white, one must acknowledge the rape of slave women at the hands of white plantation owners. Although anti-miscegenation laws outlawing racial intermarriage existed in America as early as 1664, there were no laws preventing the rape of enslaved women. For generations, enslaved black mothers bore mixed-race children who were deemed \"mulattos\", \"quadroons\", \"octoroons\" or even \"hexadecaroons\" based on their percentage of \"white blood.\" \n\nAlthough the aforementioned mixed-race people were often half white or more, institutions of hypodescent and the 20th-century one drop rule classified them as black and therefore, inferior, particularly after slavery became a racial caste. But there were other mixed-race people who were born to unions or marriages in colonial Virginia between free white women and African or African-American men, free, indentured, or slave, and became ancestors to many free families of color in the early decades of the US, as documented by Paul Heinegg in his \"Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware\".\n\nMixed-race African Americans sometimes used their racially ambiguous appearance (and often majority European ancestry) in order to pass as white and evade the restrictions against them to seek better lives. For some people, passing as white and using their whiteness to uplift other black people was the best way to undermine the system that relegated black people to a lower position in society. Although reasons behind passing are deeply individual, the history of African Americans passing as white can be categorized by the following time periods: the antebellum era, post-emancipation, Reconstruction through Jim Crow, and present day.\n\nDuring the antebellum period, passing as white was a means of escaping slavery. Once they left the plantation, escaped slaves who could pass as white found safety in their perceived whiteness. To pass as white was to pass as free. However, once they gained their freedom, most escaped slaves intended to return to blackness - passing as white was a temporary disguise used to gain freedom. Once they had escaped, their racial ambiguity could be a safeguard to their freedom. If an escaped slave was able to pass as white, they were less likely to be caught and returned to their plantation. If they \"were\" caught, white-passing slaves such as Jane Morrison could sue for their freedom, using their white appearance as justification for emancipation.\n\nPost-emancipation, passing as white was no longer a means to obtain freedom. As passing shifted from a necessity to an option, it fell out of favor in the black community. Author Charles W. Chestnutt, who was born free in Ohio as a mixed-race African American, explored circumstances for persons of color in the South after emancipation, for instance, for a formerly enslaved woman who marries a white-passing man shortly after the conclusion of Civil War. Some fictional exploration coalesced around the figure of the \"tragic mulatta\", a woman whose future is compromised by her being mixed race and able to pass for white.\nDuring the Reconstruction era, black people slowly gained the constitutional rights of which they were deprived during slavery. Although they would not secure full constitutional equality for another century until after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, reconstruction promised African Americans legal equality for the first time. Abolishing slavery did not abolish racism. During Reconstruction whites tried to enforce white supremacy, in part through the rise of Ku Klux Klan chapters, rifle clubs and later paramilitary insurgent groups such as the Red Shirts. \n\nPassing was used by some African Americans to evade segregation. Those who were able to pass as white often engaged in tactical passing or passing as white in order to get a job, go to school, or to travel. Outside of these situations, \"tactical passers\" still lived as black people, and for this reason, tactical passing is also referred to as \"9 to 5 passing.\" The writer and literary critic Anatole Broyard saw his father pass in order to get work after his Louisiana Creole family moved north to Brooklyn before World War II. \n\nThis idea of crossing the color line at different points in one's life is explored in James Weldon Johnson's \"Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man.\" But the narrator closes the novel by saying \"I have sold my birthright for a mess of pottage\", meaning that he regrets trading in his blackness for whiteness. The idea that passing as white was a rejection of blackness was common at the time and remains so to the present time.\n\nPeople also chose to pass for good during Jim Crow and beyond. The US civil rights leader Walter Francis White (who was blond-haired, blue-eyed, and very fair) was of mixed-race, mostly European ancestry: 27 of his 32 great-great-great-grandparents were white; the other five were classified as black and had been slaves. He grew up with his parents and family in Atlanta in the black community and identified with it. He served as the chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1929 until his death in 1955. In the earlier stages of his career, he conducted investigations in the South, during which he sometimes passed as white in order to gather information more freely on lynchings and hate crimes, and to protect himself in socially hostile environments.\n\nIn the 20th century, \"Krazy Kat\" comics creator George Herriman was a Louisiana Creole cartoonist born to mulatto parents, who claimed Greek heritage throughout his adult life. \n\nThe 20th-century writer and critic Anatole Broyard was a Louisiana Creole who chose to pass for white in his adult life in New York City and Connecticut. He wanted to create an independent writing life and rejected being classified as a black writer. In addition, he did not identify with northern urban black people, whose experiences had been much different from his as a child in New Orleans' Creole community. He married an American woman of European descent. His wife and many of his friends knew he was partly black in ancestry. His daughter Bliss Broyard did not find out until after her father's death. In 2007, she published a memoir that traced her exploration of her father's life and family mysteries entitled \"One Drop: My Father's Hidden Life: A Story of Race and Family Secrets\".\n\nThe rise of the civil rights movement and the enforcement of voting rights for African Americans, particularly in the South, meant that political leaders called on all African Americans to unify in order to maximize their power.\n\nPassing as white in the 21st-century is more controversial: it is often seen as a rejection of blackness, family and culture.\n\nA paradoxical example of \"racial passing\" in the modern day, is Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who worked for African-American rights and tried to pass as African American. She worked as a civil rights activist. Her attempt at passing was in order to gain the support of the black community. She became president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP before her parents identified her as white.\n\nIn 21st-century intersectional discourse, the term \"white-passing\" refers to someone who identifies as a person of color but benefits from white privilege due to their appearance.\n\nOther persons have passed as Native American or First Nations people. \n\nIn the New Age and Hippie movements, non-Native people sometimes have attempted to pass as Native American or other Indigenous medicine people. The pejorative term for such people is \"plastic shaman\".\n\nThe author and environmentalist Grey Owl was born in United Kingdom as a white man named Archibald Belaney; he made a life in Canada and claimed to be a First Nations person. When asked to explain his European appearance, he lied and claimed he was half Scottish and half Apache. (There are numerous Native American-identified persons of multi-racial ancestry.) Belaney performed what he said were Ojibwe cultural practices and wilderness skills, and adopted an anachronistic and stereotypical lifestyle, as part of a persona which he was successful in marketing to non-Native audiences.\n\nThe United States actor Iron Eyes Cody, who was of Sicilian descent, developed a niche in Hollywood by playing roles of Native Americans. Initially playing Indians only in movies and television, eventually he wore his film costumes full-time and insisted he was of Cherokee and Cree descent. \n\nIn the visual arts and literature, other European-Americans have also attempted to pass as being indigenous. Ku Klux Klan leader and segregationist speech writer, Asa Earl Carter, attempted to reinvent himself as Cherokee author Forrest Carter, author of the novel \"The Education of Little Tree\".\n\nJay Marks, a man of Eastern-European Jewish ancestry, adopted the pen name of Jamake Highwater about 1969, claiming to be Cherokee-Blackfeet, and published numerous books under that name. He won awards and NEA grants. \n\nAmerican-born sculptor Jimmie Durham was exposed as a man posing as a Cherokee. Artist Yeffe Kimball claimed to be Osage.\n\nTo try to protect Native American artists from the claims of non-Native impersonators, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 was passed in the United States. It requires any visual artist claiming to be a Native American artist to be either an enrolled member of a state or federally recognized tribe, or for a recognized tribe to designate the artist as a tribal artisan.\n\nIn academia, due to non-tribal colleges' and universities' reliance on self-identification of tribal identity, non-Native people have sometimes passed as Native Americans.\n\nProfessor and activist Ward Churchill, who advocated for American Indian rights, claimed to be alternately Cherokee, Muscogee Creek, and Métis. His claims were eventually rejected by the tribes he claimed, specifically the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians. Churchill was fired in 2007 from the University of Colorado for academic misconduct over his research and writings.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" reported on October 5, 2015 that Dartmouth College fired the Director of its Native American Program, Susan Taffe Reed, \"after tribal officials and alumni accused her of misrepresenting herself as an American Indian\". She previously taught at Dartmouth, Bowdoin College, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nTerry Tafoya (now going by the name Ty Nolan), a former psychology professor at Evergreen State College, passed as being Warm Springs and Taos Pueblo. The \"Seattle Post Intelligencer\" discovered that he was neither, and reported his deception.\n\nThe Native American and Indigenous Studies Association's Statement on Indigenous Identity Fraud says:\nIf we believe in Indigenous self-determination as a value and goal, then questions of identity and integrity in its expression cannot be treated as merely a distraction from supposedly more important issues. Falsifying one’s identity or relationship to particular Indigenous peoples is an act of appropriation continuous with other forms of colonial violence.\n\nCivil rights activist Rachel Dolezal, then president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, claimed in a February 2015 profile to have been born in a \"Montana tepee\" and have hunted for food with her family as a child \"with bows and arrows\". She primarily identified as African American and had established herself as an activist in Spokane. \n\nIn 2015 Dolezal's mother disputed her daughter's accounts, saying that the family's ancestry was Czech, Swedish, and German, with \"faint traces\" of Native American heritage. She also denied various claims made by her daughter about her life, including having lived in Africa when young, although the parents did live there for a time after Dolezal had left home. Dolezal ultimately resigned from her position at the Spokane NAACP chapter.\n\nIn 2015, Vijay Chokalingam, the brother of Indian-American entertainer Mindy Kaling, told CNN that he had pretended to be black years before in order to take advantage of affirmative action to be admitted into medical school. The medical school issued a statement that Chokalingam's grades and scores met the criteria for acceptance at the time, and race had played no factor in his admission.\n\nJohn Roland Redd was an African-American musician born and raised in Missouri. In the 1950s he assumed a new identity, claiming to be an Indian named Korla Pandit and fabricating a history of birth in New Delhi, India to a Brahmin priest and a French opera singer. He established a career in this exotic persona, described as an \"Indian Liberace\". Two years after his death in 1999, his true ethnic identity was revealed in an article by \"Los Angeles\" magazine editor R. J. Smith.\n\nFor Jews in Nazi Germany, passing as \"Aryan\" or white and non-Jewish was a means of escaping persecution. There were three ways to avoid being shipped off to the death camps: run, hide or pass. No option was perfect, and all carried the risk of getting caught. People who could not run away but wanted to maintain a life without hiding attempted to pass as \"aryan.\" People who were \"visibly Jewish\" could try to alter their appearance to become \"aryan\", while other Jewish people with more ambiguous features could pass into the \"aryan\" ideal more easily. In these attempts to pass as \"aryan\", Jewish people altered their appearance by dying their hair blonde and even attempting to reverse circumcisions. Edith Hahn Beer was Jewish and passed as \"Aryan\"; she survived the Holocaust by living with and marrying a Nazi officer. Hahn-Beer wrote a memoir called: \"The Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust\". Another such example is Stella Kübler, a Jewish collaborator who initially attempted to hide her Jewish background.\n\nExamples of racial passing have been used by people to assimilate into groups other than European. Marie Lee Bandura, who grew up as part of the Qayqayt First Nation in New Westminster, British Columbia, was orphaned and believed she was the last of her people. She moved to Vancouver's Chinatown, married a Chinese man, and raised her four children as Chinese. One day she told her daughter Rhonda Larrabee about her heritage: \"I will tell you once, but you must never ask me again.\"\n\nIn Latin America, generational acculturation and assimilation took place via intermarriage. Medium-brown offspring of even dark parents were no longer \"black\", but were labeled with any of a half-dozen terms denoting class as much as skin tone. Descendants who were European-looking were accepted as white.\n\nPatrick O'Brian (1914 – 2000), born Richard Patrick Russ, an English novelist and translator, best known for his Aubrey–Maturin series of sea novels set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, was for many years presumed by reviewers and journalists to be Irish, and he took no steps to correct the impression, until a 1999 exposé in \"The Daily Telegraph\" made public the facts of his ancestry, original name and first marriage, provoking considerable critical media comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7705854", "categories": ["Cultural assimilation", "Race in the United States", "Racism"], "title": "Passing (racial identity)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7705856", "text": "History of Indigenous Australians\n\nThe History of Indigenous Australians began at least 65,000 years ago when humans first populated Australia.\n\nThe origin of first humans to populate the southern continent remains a matter of conjecture and debate. Some anthropologists believe they could have arrived as a result of the earliest human migrations out of Africa. Although they likely migrated to the territory, later named Australia, through Southeast Asia they are not demonstrably related to any known Asian or Polynesian population. There is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between Australians in the far north and the Austronesian peoples of modern-day New Guinea and the islands, but this may be the result of recent trade and intermarriage.\n\nAt the time of first European contact, it is generally estimated that between 315,000 to 750,000 people lived in Australia, in diverse groups, but upper estimates place the total population as high as 1.25 million. A cumulative population of 1.6 billion people has been estimated to have lived in Australia over 65,000 years prior to British colonisation. The regions of heaviest Indigenous population were the same temperate coastal regions that are currently the most heavily populated. In the early 1900s it was commonly believed that the Aboriginal population of Australia was leading toward extinction. The population shrank from those present when colonisation occurred in 1788 to 50,000 in 1930; this was primarily due to an outbreak of smallpox and to a lesser extent from other diseases.\n\nPost-colonisation, the coastal Indigenous populations were soon absorbed, depleted or forced from their lands; the traditional aspects of Aboriginal life which remained persisted most strongly in areas such as the Great Sandy Desert where European settlement has been sparse. The greatest population density was to be found in the southern and eastern regions of the continent, the Murray River valley in particular. Although the Indigenous Tasmanians were driven to extinction, other Aboriginal Australians maintained successful communities throughout Australia. Technologies, diets and hunting practices varied according to the local environment.\n\nIt is believed that the first early human migration to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the Sahul continent, connected to the island of New Guinea via a land bridge. It is also possible that people came by island hopping via an island chain between Sulawesi and New Guinea and the other reaches North Western Australia via Timor. The exact timing of the arrival of the ancestors of the Aboriginal Australians has been a matter of dispute among archaeologists. The most generally accepted date for first arrival is between 40,000–80,000 years BP. Near Penrith in New South Wales, since 1971 numerous Aboriginal stone tools have been found in Cranebrook Terraces gravel sediments having dates of 45,000 to 50,000 years BP. When these results were new they were controversial, but more recent dating of the same strata in 1987 and 2003 has corroborated these dates. A 48,000 BCE date is based on a few sites in northern Australia dated using thermoluminescence.\n\nA large number of sites have been radiocarbon dated to around 38,000 BCE, leading some researchers to doubt the accuracy of the thermoluminescence technique. Radiocarbon dating is limited to a maximum age of around 40,000 years. Some estimates have been given as widely as from 30,000 to 68,000 BCE. Earlier dates are requiring new techniques such as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), and the evidence for an earlier date of arrival is growing. Charles Dortch has dated recent finds on Rottnest Island, Western Australia at 70,000 years BP. The rock shelters at Malakunanja II (a shallow rock-shelter about 50 kilometres inland from the present coast) and of Nauwalabila I (70 kilometres further south) show evidence of used pieces of ochre – evidence for paint used by artists 60,000 years ago. Using OSL Rhys Jones has obtained a date for stone tools in these horizons dating from 53,000–60,000 years ago.\n\nThermoluminescence dating of the Jinmium site in the Northern Territory suggested a date of 116,000 plus or minus 12,000 BCE. Although this result received wide press coverage, it is not accepted by most archaeologists. Only Africa has older physical evidence of habitation by modern humans. There is also evidence of a change in fire regimes in Australia, drawn from reef deposits in Queensland, between 70 and 100,000 years ago, and the integration of human genomic evidence from various parts of the world also supports a date of before 60,000 years for the arrival of Australian Aboriginal people in the continent.\n\nHumans reached Tasmania approximately 40,000 years ago by migrating across a land bridge from the mainland that existed during the last glacial maximum. After the seas rose about 12,000 years ago and covered the land bridge, the inhabitants there were isolated from the mainland until the arrival of European settlers.\n\nShort statured aboriginal tribes inhabited the rainforests of North Queensland, of which the best known group is probably the Tjapukai of the Cairns area. These rainforest people, collectively referred to as Barrineans, were once considered to be a relic of an earlier wave of Negrito migration to the Australian continent, but this theory no longer finds much favour.\n\nMungo Man, whose remains were discovered in 1974 near Lake Mungo in New South Wales, is the oldest human yet found in Australia. Although the exact age of Mungo Man is in dispute, the best consensus is that he is at least 40,000 years old. Stone tools also found at Lake Mungo have been estimated, based on stratigraphic association, to be about 50,000 years old. Since Lake Mungo is in south-eastern Australia, many archaeologists have concluded that humans must have arrived in north-west Australia at least several thousand years earlier.\n\nIn 2012, the results of large-scale genotyping has indicated that Aboriginal Australians, the indigenous peoples of New Guinea and the Mamanwa, an indigenous people of the southern Philippines are closely related, having diverged from a common origin approximately 36,000 years ago. The same studies show that Aboriginal genomes consist of up to 11% Indian DNA which is uniformly spread through Northern Australia, indicating a substantial gene flow between Indian populations and Northern Australia occurred around 4,230 years ago. Changes in tool technology and food processing appear in the archaeological record around this time, suggesting there may have been migration from India.\n\nWhen the north-west of Australia, which is closest to Asia, was first occupied, the region consisted of open tropical forests and woodlands. After around 10,000 years of stable climatic conditions, by which time the Aboriginal people had settled the entire continent, temperatures began cooling and winds became stronger, leading to the beginning of an ice age. By the glacial maximum, 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to around 140 metres below its present level. Australia was connected to New Guinea and the Kimberley region of Western Australia was separated from Southeast Asia (\"Wallacea\") by a strait only approximately 90 km wide. Rainfall was 40% to 50% lower than modern levels, depending on region, while the lower CO levels (half pre-industrial levels) meant that vegetation required twice as much water for photosynthesis.\n\nThe Kimberley, including the adjacent exposed continental Sahul Shelf, was covered by vast grasslands dominated by flowering plants of the family Poaceae, with woodlands and semi-arid scrub covering the shelf joining New Guinea to Australia. Southeast of the Kimberley, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to northern Tasmania the land, including the western and southern margins of the now exposed continental shelves, was covered largely by extreme deserts and sand dunes. It is believed that during this period no more than 15% of Australia supported trees of any kind. While some tree cover remained in the southeast of Australia, the vegetation of the wetter coastal areas in this region was semi-arid savannah, while some tropical rainforests survived in isolated coastal areas of Queensland.\n\nTasmania was covered primarily by cold steppe and alpine grasslands, with snow pines at lower altitudes. There is evidence that there may have been a significant reduction in Australian Aboriginal populations during this time, and there would seem to have been scattered \"refugia\" in which the modern vegetation types and Aboriginal populations were able to survive. Corridors between these refugia seem to be routes by which people kept in contact, and they seem to have been the basis for what are now called \"Songlines\" today. With the end of the ice age, strong rains returned, until around 5,500 years ago, when the wet season cycle in the north ended, bringing with it a megadrought that lasted 1,500 years. The return of reliable rains around 4,000 years BP gave Australia its current climate.\n\nFollowing the Ice Age, Aboriginal people around the coast, from Arnhem Land, the Kimberley and the southwest of Western Australia, all tell stories of former territories that were drowned beneath the sea with the rising coastlines after the Ice Age. It was this event that isolated the Tasmanian Aboriginal people on their island, and probably led to the extinction of Aboriginal cultures on the Bass Strait Islands and Kangaroo Island in South Australia. In the interior, the end of the Ice Age may have led to the recolonisation of the desert and semi-desert areas by Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. This in part may have been responsible for the spread of languages of the Pama–Nyungan language family and secondarily responsible for the spread of male initiation rites involving circumcision. There has been a long history of contact between Papuan peoples of the Western Province, Torres Strait Islanders and the Aboriginal people in Cape York.\n\nThe Aboriginal Australians lived through great climatic changes and adapted successfully to their changing physical environment. There is much ongoing debate about the degree to which they modified the environment. One controversy revolves around the role of indigenous people in the extinction of the marsupial megafauna (also see Australian megafauna). Some argue that natural climate change killed the megafauna. Others claim that, because the megafauna were large and slow, they were easy prey for human hunters. A third possibility is that human modification of the environment, particularly through the use of fire, indirectly led to their extinction. Oral history demonstrates \"the continuity of culture of Indigenous Australians\" for at least 10,000 years. This is shown by correlation of oral history stories with verifiable incidents including known changes in sea levels and their associated large changes in location of ocean shorelines; oral records of megafauna; and comets.\n\nThe introduction of the dingo, possibly as early as 3500 BCE, showed that contact with South East Asian peoples continued, as the closest genetic connection to the dingo seems to be the wild dogs of Thailand. This contact was not just one-way, as the presence of kangaroo ticks on these dogs demonstrates. Dingoes began and evolved in Asia. The earliest known dingo-like fossils are from Ban Chiang in north-east Thailand (dated at 5500 years BP) and from north Vietnam (5000 years BP). According to skull morphology, these fossils occupy a place between Asian wolves (prime candidates were the pale footed (or Indian) wolf \"Canis lupus pallipes\" and the Arabian wolf \"Canis lupus arabs\") and modern dingoes in Australia and Thailand.\n\nMost scientists presently believe that it was the arrival of the Australian Aboriginal people on the continent and their introduction of fire-stick farming that was responsible for these extinctions. Fossil research published in 2017 indicates that Aboriginal people and megafauna coexisted for \"at least 17,000 years\". Aboriginal Australians used fire for a variety of purposes: to encourage the growth of edible plants and fodder for prey; to reduce the risk of catastrophic bushfires; to make travel easier; to eliminate pests; for ceremonial purposes; for warfare and just to \"clean up country.\" There is disagreement, however, about the extent to which this burning led to large-scale changes in vegetation patterns.\n\nAboriginal Australians were limited to the range of foods occurring naturally in their area, but they knew exactly when, where and how to find everything edible. Anthropologists and nutrition experts who have studied the tribal diet in Arnhem Land found it to be well-balanced, with most of the nutrients modern dietitians recommend. But food was not obtained without effort. In some areas both men and women had to spend from half to two-thirds of each day hunting or foraging for food. Each day, the women of the group went into successive parts of one countryside with wooden digging sticks and plaited dilly bags or wooden coolamons. Larger animals and birds, such as kangaroos and emus, were speared or disabled with a thrown club, boomerang, or stone. Many Indigenous hunting devices were used to get within striking distance of prey. The men were excellent trackers and stalkers, approaching their prey running where there was cover, or 'freezing' and crawling when in the open. They were careful to stay downwind and sometimes covered themselves with mud to disguise their smell.\n\nFish were sometimes taken by hand by stirring up the muddy bottom of a pool until they rose to the surface, or by placing the crushed leaves of poisonous plants in the water to stupefy them. Fish spears, nets, wicker or stone traps were also used in different areas. Lines with hooks made from bone, shell, wood or spines were used along the north and east coasts. Dugong, turtle and large fish were harpooned, the harpooner launching himself bodily from the canoe to give added weight to the thrust. The mode of life and material cultures varied greatly from region to region. While Torres Strait Island populations were agriculturalists who supplemented their diet through the acquisition of wild foods, most Aboriginal Australians were hunter-gatherers. Aboriginal Australians along the coast and rivers were also expert fishermen. Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people relied on the dingo as a companion animal, using it to assist with hunting and for warmth on cold nights.\n\nIn present-day Victoria, for example, there were two separate communities with an economy based on eel-farming in complex and extensive irrigated pond systems; one on the Murray River in the state's north, the other in the south-west near Hamilton in the territory of the Djab Wurrung, which traded with other groups from as far away as the Melbourne area (see Gunditjmara). A primary tool used in hunting is the spear, launched by a woomera or spear-thrower in some locales. Boomerangs were also used by some mainland Indigenous Australians. The non-returnable boomerang (known more correctly as a Throwing Stick), more powerful than the returning kind, could be used to injure or even kill a kangaroo.\n\nOn mainland Australia no animal other than the dingo was domesticated, however domestic pigs were utilised by Torres Strait Islanders. The typical Aboriginal diet included a wide variety of foods, such as pig, kangaroo, emu, wombats, goanna, snakes, birds, many insects such as honey ants, Bogong moths and witchetty grubs. Many varieties of plant foods such as taro, coconuts, nuts, fruits and berries were also eaten.\n\nPermanent villages were the norm for most Torres Strait Island communities. In some areas mainland Aboriginal Australians also lived in semi-permanent villages, most usually in less arid areas where fishing could provide for a more settled existence. Most Indigenous communities were semi-nomadic, moving in a regular cycle over a defined territory, following seasonal food sources and returning to the same places at the same time each year. From the examination of middens, archaeologists have shown that some localities were visited annually by Indigenous communities for thousands of years. In the more arid areas Aboriginal Australians were nomadic, ranging over wide areas in search of scarce food resources. There is evidence of substantial change in indigenous culture over time. Rock painting at several locations in northern Australia has been shown to consist of a sequence of different styles linked to different historical periods. There is also prominent rock paintings found in the Sydney basin area which date to around 5,000 years.\n\nHarry Lourandos has been the leading proponent of the theory that a period of hunter-gatherer intensification occurred between 3000 and 1000 BCE. Intensification involved an increase in human manipulation of the environment (for example, the construction of eel traps in Victoria), population growth, an increase in trade between groups, a more elaborate social structure, and other cultural changes. A shift in stone tool technology, involving the development of smaller and more intricate points and scrapers, occurred around this time. This was probably also associated with the introduction to the mainland of the Australian dingo.\n\nMany Indigenous communities also have a very complex kinship structure and in some places strict rules about marriage. In traditional societies, men are required to marry women of a specific moiety. The system is still alive in many Central Australian communities. To enable men and women to find suitable partners, many groups would come together for annual gatherings (commonly known as corroborees) at which goods were traded, news exchanged, and marriages arranged amid appropriate ceremonies. This practice both reinforced clan relationships and prevented inbreeding in a society based on small semi-nomadic groups.\n\nIn 1770, Lieutenant James Cook wrote that he had claimed the east coast of Australia for the United Kingdom and named it New South Wales, while on Possession Island off the west coast of Cape York Peninsula. However, it seems that no such claim was made when Cook was in Australia. Cook was not authorized to make such a claim and Joseph Banks, who was standing beside Cook, does not mention the event. Furthermore, Cook's purported declaration was made unilaterally and without any consultation with First Australians, in spite of his direct written orders from The Admiralty, which instructed him to conclude a treaty with the inhabitants (if any) and obtain their permission for the expropriation of land. British colonisation of Australia began in Sydney in 1788. \n\nThe first apparent consequence of British settlement appeared in April 1789 when a disease, which was probably smallpox, struck the Aborigines about Port Jackson. Thereafter, other European epidemic diseases arrived such as chickenpox, influenza and measles, which spread in advance of the frontier of settlement. The worst-hit communities were the ones with the greatest population densities, where disease could spread more readily. In the arid centre of the continent, where small communities were spread over a vast area, the population decline was less marked. Disease was the principal cause of population decline.\n\nThe second consequence of British settlement was appropriation of land and water resources. The settlers took the view that Aboriginal Australians were nomads with no concept of land ownership, who could be driven off land wanted for farming or grazing and who would be just as happy somewhere else. In fact the loss of traditional lands, food sources and water resources was often fatal, particularly to communities already weakened by disease. Additionally, Aboriginal Australians groups had a deep spiritual and cultural connection to the land, so that in being forced to move away from traditional areas, cultural and spiritual practices necessary to the cohesion and well-being of the group could not be maintained. Proximity to settlers also brought venereal disease, to which Aboriginal Australians had no tolerance and which greatly reduced Aboriginal fertility and birthrates. Settlers also brought alcohol, opium and tobacco, and substance abuse has remained a chronic problem for Aboriginal communities ever since. Entire communities in the moderately fertile southern part of the continent simply vanished without trace, often before European settlers arrived or recorded their existence.\n\nDeadly infectious diseases like smallpox, influenza and tuberculosis were always major causes of Aboriginal deaths. \nSmallpox alone killed more than 50% of the Aboriginal population. \n\nIn April 1789, a major outbreak of smallpox killed large numbers of Indigenous Australians between Hawkesbury River, Broken Bay, and Port Hacking. Based on information recorded in the journals of some members of the First Fleet, it has been surmised that the Aborigines of the Sydney region had never encountered the disease before and lacked immunity to it. Unable to understand or counter the sickness, they often fled, leaving the sick with some food and water to fend for themselves. As the clans fled, the epidemic spread further along the coast and into the hinterland. This had a disastrous effect on Aboriginal society; with many of the productive hunters and gatherers dead, those who survived the initial outbreak began to starve.\n\nLieutenant William Bradley recorded the first indications of the severity of the disaster that had struck the Aboriginal population of Sydney when he described his shock at the small number of them to be seen on the harbour and its shores compared with previous times. The British had not seen smallpox in anyone among themselves before the outbreak. Although there were fears about the health of some of the convicts on the First Fleet, these were subsequently dismissed by Surgeon-General John White, who believed they were suffering from \"slight inflammatory complaints\".\n\nSome commentators, such as Judy Campbell, have suggested that Makasar fishermen accidentally brought smallpox to Australia’s north and the virus travelled south. However, given that the spread of the disease depends on high population densities, and the fact that those who succumbed were soon incapable of walking, such an outbreak was unlikely to have spread across the desert trade routes. A more likely source of the disease was the \"variolas matter\" Surgeon John White brought with him on the First Fleet, although it is unknown how this may have been spread. It has been speculated that the vials were either accidentally or intentionally released it as a \"biological weapon\". Some researchers, such as Seth Carus and Chris Warren suggest that the infection was deliberate. In 2014, writing in \"Journal of Australian Studies\", Christopher Warren concluded that British marines were most likely to have spread smallpox, possibly without informing Governor Phillip, but conceded in his conclusion that \"today's evidence only provides for a balancing of probabilities and this is all that can be attempted.\"\n\nOn the mainland, prolonged conflict followed the frontier of European settlement. In 1834, John Dunmore Lang wrote: \"There is black blood at this moment on the hands of individuals of good repute in the colony of New South Wales of which all the waters of New Holland would be insufficient to wash out the indelible stains.\" In 1790, an Aboriginal leader Pemulwuy in Sydney resisted the Europeans, waging a guerrilla-style warfare on the settlers in a series of wars known as the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars, which spanned 26 years, from 1790 to 1816. In 1838, twenty eight Aboriginal people were killed at the Myall Creek massacre; seven of the convict settlers responsible, six white men and one African man, were tried, convicted and hung for the murders. Many Aboriginal communities resisted the settlers, such as the Noongar of south-western Australia, led by Yagan, who was killed in 1833. The Kalkadoon of Queensland also resisted the settlers, and there was a massacre of over 200 people on their land at Battle Mountain in 1884. There was a massacre at Coniston in the Northern Territory in 1928. Poisoning of food and water has been recorded on several different occasions. The number of violent deaths at the hands of white people is still the subject of debate, with a figure of around 10,000 - 20,000 deaths being advanced by historians such as Henry Reynolds. However the methodology behind figures such as this one has been criticised due to the fact that only white deaths were documented in frontier conflicts, forcing historians to estimate a country-wide white-black death ratio in violent confrontations and infer from this the number of Aboriginal deaths. Reynolds, and other historians, estimate that up to 3,000 white people were killed by Aboriginal Australians in the frontier violence. By the 1870s all the fertile areas of Australia had been appropriated, and Aboriginal communities reduced to impoverished remnants living either on the fringes of European communities or on lands considered unsuitable for settlement.\n\nThe Palawa, or Indigenous people of Tasmania, were particularly hard-hit. Nearly all of them, apparently numbering somewhere between 2,000 and 15,000 when white settlement began, were dead by the 1870s. It is widely claimed that this was the result of a genocidal policy, in the form of the \"Black War\". Other historians dispute this. Geoffrey Blainey wrote that, in Tasmania, by 1830: \"Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating.\" Josephine Flood wrote: \"The catastrophic death rate was due to new diseases, particularly pulmonary and sexually transmitted ones.\" Historian Keith Windschuttle also disagrees that violence was the principal cause. He argues that there are plausible recorded accounts of approximately 120 Aboriginal Tasmanians killed in 1803–47, that there were an unknown number of unrecorded killings and that many of these were killed in 'self-defence' by settlers. Windschuttle argues some accounts of killings are implausible for a variety of reasons such as incidents involving improbably large death tolls given the muzzle-loading, single-shot muskets in use and that the low number of plausible recorded killings is one indicator of a relatively low level of conflict. Another scholar, H. A. Willis, has subsequently disputed Windschuttle's figures and has documented 188 Palawa killed by settlers in 1803–34 alone, with possibly another 145 killed during the same period. Such counts do not consider undocumented violence and must be regarded as minimum estimates. It is also claimed, but untrue, that the last Aboriginal Tasmanian was Truganini, who died in 1876. This belief stems from a distinction between \"full bloods\" and \"half castes\" that is now generally regarded as racist. Palawa people survived, in missions set up on the islands of Bass Strait.\nNevertheless, some initial contact between Aboriginal people and Europeans was peaceful, starting with the Guugu Yimithirr people who met James Cook near Cooktown in 1770. Bennelong served as interlocutor between the Eora people of Sydney and the British colony, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to travel to England, staying there between 1792 and 1795. Aboriginal people were known to help European explorers, such as John King, who lived with a tribe for two and a half months after the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition of 1861. Also living with Indigenous people was William Buckley, an escaped convict, who was with the Wautharong people near Melbourne for thirty-two years, before being found in 1835. Many Indigenous people adapted to European culture, working as stock hands or labourers. The first Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1868, was principally made up of Indigenous players.\n\nAs the European pastoral industries developed, several economic changes came about. The appropriation of prime land and the spread of European livestock over vast areas made a traditional Indigenous lifestyle less viable, but also provided a ready alternative supply of fresh meat for those prepared to incur the settlers' anger by hunting livestock. The impact of disease and the settlers' industries had a profound impact on the Indigenous Australians' way of life. With the exception of a few in the remote interior, all surviving Indigenous communities gradually became dependent on the settler population for their livelihood.\n\nIn south-eastern Australia, during the 1850s, large numbers of white pastoral workers deserted employment on stations for the Australian goldrushes. Indigenous women, men and children became a significant source of labour. Most Indigenous labour was unpaid, instead Indigenous workers received rations in the form of food, clothing and other basic necessities. In the later 19th century, settlers made their way north and into the interior, appropriating small but vital parts of the land for their own exclusive use (waterholes and soaks in particular), and introducing sheep, rabbits and cattle, all three of which ate out previously fertile areas and degraded the ability of the land to carry the native animals that were vital to Indigenous economies. Indigenous hunters would often spear sheep and cattle, incurring the wrath of graziers, after they replaced the native animals as a food source. As large sheep and cattle stations came to dominate northern Australia, Indigenous workers were quickly recruited. Several other outback industries, notably pearling, also employed Aboriginal workers.\n\nIn many areas Christian missions provided food and clothing for Indigenous communities and also opened schools and orphanages for Indigenous children. In some places colonial governments provided some resources.\n\nIn spite of the impact of disease, violence and the spread of foreign settlement and custom, some Indigenous communities in remote desert and tropical rainforest areas survived according to traditional means until well into the 20th century. In 1914 around 800 Aboriginal people answered the call to arms to fight in World War I, despite restrictions on Indigenous Australians serving in the military. As the war continued, these restrictions were relaxed as more recruits were needed. Many enlisted by claiming they were Māori or Indian.\n\nBy the 1920s, the Indigenous population had declined to between 50,000 and 90,000, and the belief that the Indigenous Australians would soon die out was widely held, even among Australians sympathetic to their situation. But by about 1930, those Indigenous Australians who had survived had acquired better resistance to imported diseases, and birthrates began to rise again as communities were able to adapt to changed circumstances. From the 1940s, the availability of penicillin to treat imported diseases also had a marked effect on reversing the population decline.\n\nIn the Northern Territory, significant frontier conflict continued. Both isolated Europeans and visiting Asian fishermen were killed by hunter gatherers until the start of World War II in 1939. It is known that some European settlers in the centre and north of the country shot Indigenous people during this period. One particular series of killings became known as the Caledon Bay crisis, and became a watershed in the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nIn the early 20th century, anthropologists' influence dominated society's view of aboriginals in Australia. They were viewed as a different race that was not as evolved as Europeans. Starting in the 1880 and continuing into the 20th century, debate continued on where between ape and man could the aboriginal be situated in evolutionary terms. In the mid-1920s, there was a shift in focus away from physical anthropological issues of race and towards a cultural anthropological concerns established by field-work. New studies described aboriginals' social organisation, religious belief and practice. Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, the father of modern social anthropology, published his \"Social Organization of Australian Tribes\" in 1931.\n\nBy the end of World War II, many Indigenous men had served in the military and were paid an equitable salary. However, Aboriginal workers remained unfree labourers, paid only small amounts of cash in addition to rations, and had their movements severely restricted by regulations and/or police action. On 4 February 1939, Jack Patten led a strike at Cummeragunja Mission in New South Wales. The people of Cummeragunja were protesting their harsh treatment under what was a draconian system. A once successful farming enterprise was taken from their control, and residents were forced to subsist on meager rations. Approximately 200 people left their homes, taking part in the Cummeragunja walk-off, and the majority crossed the border into Victoria, never to return home.\n\nOn 1 May 1946, Aboriginal peoples station workers in the buetiful region of Western Australia started the 1946 Pilbara strike and never returned to work. Mass layoffs across northern Australia followed the Federal Pastoral Industry Award of 1968, which required the payment of a minimum wage to Aboriginal station workers, as they were not paid by the Pastoralist discretion, many however were not and those who were had their money held by the government. Many of the workers and their families became refugees or fringe dwellers, living in camps on the outskirts of towns and cities.\n\nIn 1949, the right to vote in federal elections was extended to Indigenous Australians who had served in the armed forces, or were enrolled to vote in state elections. At that time, those Indigenous Australians who lived in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were still ineligible to vote in state elections, consequently they did not have the right to vote in federal elections.\n\nAll Indigenous Australians were given the right to vote in Commonwealth elections in Australia by the Menzies government in 1962. The first federal election in which all Aboriginal Australians could vote was held in November 1963. The right to vote in state elections was granted in Western Australia in 1962 and Queensland was the last state to do so in 1965.\n\nThe 1967 referendum, passed with a 90% majority, allowed Indigenous Australians to be included in the Commonwealth parliament's power to make special laws for specific races, and to be included in counts to determine electoral representation. This has been the largest affirmative vote in the history of Australia's referendums.\n\nIn 1971, Yolngu people at Yirrkala sought an injunction against Nabalco to cease mining on their traditional land. In the resulting historic and controversial Gove land rights case, Justice Blackburn ruled that Australia had been terra nullius before European settlement, and that no concept of Native title existed in Australian law. Although the Yolngu people were defeated in this action, the effect was to highlight the absurdity of the law, which led first to the Woodward Commission, and then to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act.\n\nIn 1972, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was established on the steps of Parliament House in Canberra, in response to the sentiment among Indigenous Australians that they were \"strangers in their own country\". A Tent Embassy still exists on the same site.\n\nIn 1975, the Whitlam government drafted the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which aimed to restore traditional lands to Indigenous people. After the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the Governor-General, a reduced-scope version of the Act (known as the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976) was introduced by the coalition government led by Malcolm Fraser. While its application was limited to the Northern Territory, it did grant \"inalienable\" freehold title to some traditional lands.\n\nIn 1984, a group of Pintupi people who were living a traditional hunter-gatherer desert-dwelling life were tracked down in the Gibson Desert in Western Australia and brought into a settlement. They are believed to have been the last uncontacted tribe in Australia.\n\nA 1987 federal government report described the history of the \"Aboriginal Homelands Movement\" or \"Return to Country movement\" as \"a concerted attempt by Aboriginal people in the 'remote' areas of Australia to leave government settlements, reserves, missions and non-Aboriginal townships and to re-occupy their traditional country.\"\n\nIn 1992, the Australian High Court handed down its decision in the Mabo Case, declaring the previous legal concept of \"terra nullius\" to be invalid. This decision legally recognised certain land claims of Indigenous Australians in Australia prior to British Settlement. Legislation was subsequently enacted and later amended to recognise Native Title claims over land in Australia.\n\nIn 1998, as the result of an inquiry into the forced removal of Indigenous children (see Stolen generation) from their families, a National Sorry Day was instituted, to acknowledge the wrong that had been done to Indigenous families. Many politicians, from both sides of the house, participated, with the notable exception of the Prime Minister, John Howard.\n\nIn 1999 a referendum was held to change the Australian Constitution to include a preamble that, amongst other topics, recognised the occupation of Australia by Indigenous Australians prior to British Settlement. This referendum was defeated, though the recognition of Indigenous Australians in the preamble was not a major issue in the referendum discussion, and the preamble question attracted minor attention compared to the question of becoming a republic.\n\nIn 2004, the Australian Government abolished The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), which had been Australia's top Indigenous organisation. The Commonwealth cited corruption and, in particular, made allegations concerning the misuse of public funds by ATSIC's chairman, Geoff Clark, as the principal reason. Indigenous specific programmes have been mainstreamed, that is, reintegrated and transferred to departments and agencies serving the general population. The Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination was established within the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and now with the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to coordinate a \"whole of government\" effort.\n\nIn June 2005, Richard Frankland, founder of the 'Your Voice' political party, in an open letter to Prime Minister John Howard, advocated that the eighteenth-century conflicts between Aboriginal and colonial Australians \"be recognised as wars and be given the same attention as the other wars receive within the Australian War Memorial\". In its editorial on 20 June 2005, Melbourne newspaper, The Age, said that \"Frankland has raised an important question,\" and asked whether moving \"work commemorating Aborigines who lost their lives defending their land ... to the War Memorial [would] change the way we regard Aboriginal history.\"\n\nIn 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a formal apology for the Stolen Generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7705856", "categories": ["History of Indigenous Australians"], "title": "History of Indigenous Australians"}

It was initially developed in the late-1970s and used in scientific research before being sold as a designer drug in the mid-2000s. It has been detected in pills touted as legal alternatives to illicit stimulants in New Zealand and pills sold as \"ecstasy\" in Europe and the United States.\n\nDespite its advertisement as a recreational substance, mCPP is actually generally considered to be an unpleasant experience and is not desired by drug users. It lacks any reinforcing or hallucinogenic effects, produces dysphoric, depressive, and anxiogenic effects in rodents and humans, and can induce panic attacks in individuals susceptible to them. It also worsens obsessive–compulsive symptoms in people with the disorder.\n\nmCPP is known to induce headaches in humans and has been used for testing potential antimigraine medications. It has potent anorectic effects and has encouraged the development of selective 5-HT receptor agonists for the treatment of obesity as well.\n\nmCPP possesses significant affinity for the 5-HT, 5-HT, 5-HT, 5-HT, 5-HT, 5-HT, 5-HT, and 5-HT receptors, as well as the SERT. It also has some affinity for α-adrenergic, α-adrenergic, H, I, and NET. It behaves as an agonist at most serotonin receptors. mCPP has been shown to act not only as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor but as a serotonin releasing agent as well.\n\nmCPP's strongest actions are at the 5-HT and 5-HT receptors and its discriminative cue is mediated primarily by 5-HT. Its negative effects such as anxiety, headaches, and appetite loss are likely mediated by its actions on the 5-HT receptor. Other effects of mCPP include nausea, hypoactivity, and penile erection, the latter two the result of increased 5-HT activity and the former likely via 5-HT stimulation.\n\nIn comparison studies, mCPP has approximately 10-fold selectivity for the human 5-HT receptor over the human 5-HT and 5-HT receptors (K = 3.4 nM vs. 32.1 and 28.8 nM). It acts as a partial agonist of the human 5-HT receptor but as an antagonist of the human 5-HT and 5-HT receptors. In accordance with its lack of agonism towards the human 5-HT receptor, there are no reports that mCPP produces hallucinogenic effects in humans.\n\nmCPP is metabolized via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme by hydroxylation to \"para\"-hydroxy-mCPP (\"p\"-OH-mCPP). Caution should be exercised in coprescribing inhibitors or substrates of CYP2D6 with drugs such as trazodone and nefazodone that have mCPP as a metabolite.\n\nmCPP is a metabolite of a variety of other piperazine drugs including trazodone, nefazodone, etoperidone, enpiprazole, mepiprazole, cloperidone, peraclopone, and BRL-15,572.

A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on December 18, 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008.

The current representative is Robert C. Scott (D).\n\nThe Virginia Legislature's 2012 redistricting was found unconstitutional and replaced with a court-ordered redistricting on January 16, 2016 for the 2016 elections. One reason for the redistricting is the racial gerrymandering. From 1993 to 2016, the 3rd had covered most of the majority-black precincts in and around Hampton Roads and Richmond. The court-drawn map shifted the area near Richmond to the 4th District. The dispute over the district borders went to the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Wittman v. Personhuballah\".\n\nIn 1788 Virginia's 3rd Congressional District consisted of all of modern Virginia including and west of the counties of Carroll, Floyd, Roanoke, Botetourt, Augusta and Rockingham. It also included what is today Pendleton County, West Virginia and also about the southern third of West Virginia which in 1788 was all Greenbrier County. This area that is today about 48 counties and 13 independent cities was in 1788 only nine counties.\n\nIn the 1790 census this area had a population of 66,045.\n\nFor the 1792 congressional elections the number of congressional districts in Virginia rose from 10 to 19. The only county that remained in the third district was Pendleton County. Harrison, Randolph, Hardy, Hampshire, Monongalia and Ohio Counties, all now in West Virginia were also in the district. This was all of northern West Virginia except the far eastern panhandle area. The new district's 1790 population was 30,145.\n\nThe 1800 Census lead to another increase in Virginia's congressional districts in 1802. The third district was again moved, this time to what was then Frederick and Shenandoah Counties in Virginia, which besides those counties also included the modern counties of Clarke, Warren and part of Page. The new 3rd district had a population of 38,767 in 1800.\n\nFor most of the time from the end of the Civil War to 1993, the 3rd District was a relatively compact district centered on Richmond.\n\nThe district's current configuration dates to 1993, when the Justice Department ordered Virginia to create a majority-minority district. At that time, portions of the old 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th districts were combined to create a new 3rd District.\n\nAs of 2016, the 3rd district has been ruled unconstitutional.

She subsequently accused Sherwood of abusing her during their relationship.\n\nIn court documents and press interviews, Ore said she met Congressman Sherwood at a Young Republicans meeting in September 1999. Ore was 23 years old and Sherwood was 58 when they began a \"close romantic and intimate personal relationship\", according to a 2005  . Their five-year extramarital affair ended after Ore described several instances of physical abuse by the congressman.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 15, 2004, Ore locked herself inside the bathroom of Sherwood's Washington, D.C. apartment. She used her cell phone to make an emergency call to police. When authorities arrived, Ore reported that she had been choked by Sherwood. The congressman told police he was only giving her a backrub. Initially, no charges were filed. Their relationship soon ended—though Ore has stated that Sherwood remained in contact with her.\n\nSherwood initially denied the affair, stating that Ore was merely a \"casual acquaintance\". After a   was leaked to the press in 2005, Sherwood publicly admitted his lengthy affair with Ore, but denied her reports of abuse. Ore filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against Sherwood in June 2005. The suit was settled out of court on November 8, 2005, but the terms of the monetary settlement have never been made public.\n\nIn an interview with a Wilkes-Barre newspaper, Ore said she was born to a wealthy family and grew up in Peru. Various news stories in 2005 and 2006 gave her age as 29 and mentioned in passing that, in 2001, she had been an intern for U.S. Representative Bill Shuster, another Pennsylvania Republican, but left after two days.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7705960", "text": "Modal dispersion\n\nModal dispersion is a distortion mechanism occurring in multimode fibers and other waveguides, in which the signal is spread in time because the propagation velocity of the optical signal is not the same for all modes. Other names for this phenomenon include multimode distortion, multimode dispersion, modal distortion, intermodal distortion, intermodal dispersion, and intermodal delay distortion.\n\nIn the ray optics analogy, modal dispersion in a step-index optical fiber may be compared to multipath propagation of a radio signal. Rays of light enter the fiber with different angles to the fiber axis, up to the fiber's acceptance angle. Rays that enter with a shallower angle travel by a more direct path, and arrive sooner than rays that enter at a steeper angle (which reflect many more times off the boundaries of the core as they travel the length of the fiber). The arrival of different components of the signal at different times distorts the shape. \n\nModal dispersion limits the bandwidth of multimode fibers. For example, a typical step-index fiber with a 50 µm core would be limited to approximately 20 MHz for a one kilometer length, in other words, a bandwidth of 20 MHz·km. Modal dispersion may be considerably reduced, but never completely eliminated, by the use of a core having a graded refractive index profile. However, multimode graded-index fibers having bandwidths exceeding 3.5 GHz·km at 850 nm are now commonly manufactured for use in 10 Gbit/s data links. \n\nModal dispersion should not be confused with chromatic dispersion, a distortion that results due to the differences in propagation velocity of different wavelengths of light. Modal dispersion occurs even with an ideal, monochromatic light source. \n\nA special case of modal dispersion is polarization mode dispersion (PMD), a fiber dispersion phenomenon usually associated with single-mode fibers. PMD results when two modes that normally travel at the same speed due to fiber core geometric and stress symmetry (for example, two orthogonal polarizations in a waveguide of circular or square cross-section), travel at different speeds due to random imperfections that break the symmetry.\n\nIn multimode optical fiber with many wavelengths propagating, it is sometimes hard to identify the dispersed wavelength out of all the wavelengths that are present, if there is not yet a service degradation issue. One can compare the present optical power of each wavelength to the designed values and look for differences. After that, the optical fiber is tested end to end. If no loss is found, then most probably there is dispersion with that particular wavelength. Normally engineers start testing the fiber section by section until they reach the affected section; all wavelengths are tested and the affected wavelength produces a loss at the far end of the fiber. One can easily calculate how much of the fiber is affected and replace that part of fiber with a new one. Replacement of optical fiber is only required when there is an intense dispersion and service is being affected; otherwise various methods can be used to compensate for the dispersion.\n", "id": "7705960", "categories": ["Fiber optics"], "title": "Modal dispersion"}

Minister of Economy during much of the 1959-62 period, he was one of the principal proponents of economic conservatism in modern Argentina.\n\nAlsogaray was born in Esperanza, Santa Fe, in 1913, as the eldest of three children to Julia Elisa Bosch and Álvaro Alsogaray. Born to a prominent local military family, Alsogaray graduated from the National Military College as an infantry officer. He studied military engineering in the Army's School of Higher Technical Studies and civil and aeronautical engineer at the National University of Córdoba. He married Edith Gay in 1940, and had two sons and a daughter.\n\nHe retired from the army with the rank of captain and with two engineering degrees, which led to his being called \"el capitán ingeniero\". He entered business, becoming an important contractor for State enterprises such as FAMA (a predecessor of flag carrier Aerolíneas Argentinas), and briefly served as its director during the presidency of Juan Perón, whose populist politics and policies would later be anathema to Alsogaray's thinking.\n\nAfter the coup that removed Perón in 1955, he held the posts of Under-secretary of Commerce and Minister of Industry, and maintained numerous Peronist staffers at the Undersecretariat despite his support for the coup. He founded the Independent Civic Party in 1956; the party fared modestly in the 1958 elections.\n\nTo placate powerful agrarian interests and other conservatives, the otherwise progressive Arturo Frondizi named Alsogaray Minister of the Economy in early 1959. Inheriting large trade deficits, Alsogaray sharply devalued the peso and imposed severe credit controls on Argentina's large public banks. Declaring that the economy \"must go through winter\", the austerity measures were a boon to exporters - but caused consumer prices to double in 1959, and real wages and construction to fall by about 20%. The resulting trade surplus and pro-growth policies pursued by Frondizi's unofficial point man on the economy, Rogelio Julio Frigerio, both contributed to a robust recovery in 1960 and 1961.\n\nMarginalized in favor of Frigerio after the 1959 recession and deeply unpopular, Alsogaray resigned early in 1961. Frigerio had been President Frondizi's first choice for the critical Economy Ministry, an appointment thwarted by the military; Frondizi and Frigerio later founded the MID, a political party centered around the need for accelerated development.\n\nFrondizi's efforts to mediate differences between the United States and Cuba ultimately resulted in a March, 1962, coup d'état, and Álvaro Alsogaray was able to use the influence of his brother, General Julio Alsogaray, to secure several ministerial and planning posts under Frondizi's military-appointed successor, Senate President José María Guido. Reintroducing many of his restrictive 1959 policies, as well as nearly worthless \"Ninth of July\" bonds, which were issued in lieu of cash payments to public employees and government contractors, the economy again slipped into severe recession; the trade balance improved, albeit the cost of depressed business investment.\n\nOut of power after the election of Dr. Arturo Illia in 1963, Alsogaray devoted himself to undermining the new administration, even during the vigorous economic recovery that followed. Finding allies in conservative business and media interests, the powerful Roman Catholic Church, and his influential brother Julio, Alsogaray and other Illia opponents were successful. Following the 1966 coup against President Illia, he was designated Ambassador to the United States, a post he held until 1968.\n\nAlsogaray founded the 'New Force' in 1972, though like the Independent Civic Party, it fared poorly in the 1973 elections that returned Perón to power. He was among the few conservative figures to publicly oppose the imminent March 1976 coup, but largely supported the subsequent National Reorganization Process. As the dictatorship eventually yielded to calls for elections, he founded the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCeDé) in 1982. Running as a right-wing, economically conservative candidate on the latter ticket, he stood for the Presidency in 1983 and 1989. Alsogaray received two million votes (10%) in his 1989 presidential bid, behind only major party candidates Carlos Menem and Eduardo Angeloz.\n\nContinuing to enjoy a measure of support in Buenos Aires' affluent northside, he and his daughter María Julia Alsogaray were elected the only two national deputies for the UCeDé in 1983, and he served until 1999. A vehement anti-Peronist and anti-socialist, Alsogaray forged an alliance with the late Juan Perón's Justicialist Party in 1989, following their nomination of pro-market Governor Carlos Menem, and endorsed Justicialist candidate Eduardo Vaca that year in a tightly-contested seat in the Argentine Senate representing the City of Buenos Aires. Argentine Senators were indirectly elected at the time, and Alsogaray's endorsement in the electoral college gave Vaca the seat, despite the latter's coming in second to centrist UCR candidate Fernando de la Rúa. The Universidad Francisco Marroquín granted Alsogaray an honorary doctorate in 1985.\n\nA vocal supporter of the era's privatizations, he prevailed on President Menem to appoint his daughter, María Julia, Secretary of the Environment, in which post she served from 1991 to 1999, and himself served in numerous consultative posts during the Menem presidency, endorsing the populist-turned-conservative president in his 1995 re-election bid. Among his most notable roles in this era was as director of a feasibility study in 1995-96 for the replacement of Buenos Aires' two international airports for an island terminal on the Río de la Plata; opposed by de la Rúa, who had been elected Mayor (and would later be President), the project never materialized. His UCedé party languished despite his renewed influence as much due to public mistrust of his policies, as because of rivalries in the party itself – notably between his daughter and Adelina D'Alessio de Viola (whom he had Menem appoint as head of the National Mortgage Bank). Commenting on the dispute, he remarked that \"\"would it that one's political party could do without affiliates...or women!\"\" \n\nAlsogaray, who perennially sought television airtime, lived out his last few years in seclusion. He lost his wife in 2004, and died in Buenos Aires the following year at the age of 91. Adamantly conservative, he was of the opinion that, if anything, the 1976-83 dictatorship was too moderate. He felt that some of the most brutal torturers during Dirty War, such as Alfredo Astiz, were \"heroes,\" and even once attempted to use his influence over the Menem administration to have a monument built in their honor.\n", "id": "7705962", "categories": ["Ambassadors of Argentina to the United States", "Colegio Militar de la Nación alumni", "Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery", "1913 births", "Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies", "2005 deaths", "Candidates for President of Argentina", "Argentine engineers", "Argentine people of Basque descent", "Argentine anti-communists", "Argentine Ministers of Finance", "Union of the Democratic Centre (Argentina) politicians", "National University of Córdoba alumni", "People from Esperanza, Santa Fe", "Argentine businesspeople"], "title": "Álvaro Alsogaray"}

Track also noted Ron Isley's growing transition into singing more ballads, compared to the band's more funk approach. \nWhile the song didn't chart on either the pop or R&B singles chart, it still garnered popularity initially for its laid-back grooves and the solemn lyrics (the song discussed infidelity) and later would be the basis of a sample years later first by rap group Compton's Most Wanted on their album \"Straight Checkn 'Em\" on the track \"Can I Kill It?\" and rapper Ice Cube, who used the musical instrumental of the song for his breakthrough hit, \"It Was a Good Day\". While the song is well noted for its unique guitar timbre which can be heard on other Isley Brother tracks such as \"Voyage to Atlantis\". However, the track is most commonly sampled for its unique syncopated drum riff. \n\nThe song was again sampled by Black Milk on Slum Village's 2005 self-titled album on the track \"Call Me\" (which featured R&B singer Dwele), and Hip-Hop producer J Dilla reworked it into \"Won't Do\" on his posthumous album \"The Shining\". Singer k-os used a sped-up sample from the song for his 2002 single \"Heaven Only Knows\", from his album \"Exit\". \n\nAlthough lesser known, the song was also sampled by Usher on his second album \"My Way\" in the song \"One Day You'll Be Mine.\" The song is also sampled on the Rhymefest song \"All Girls Cheat\" from his 2006 album \"Blue Collar\", although the portion of the song used is sung by Mario, and not a sample of the original recording. Alicia Keys heavily sampled on her song \"A Woman's Worth\", recorded for her 2005 live album \"Unplugged\". The song was also sampled by Raheem DeVaughn on \"Until\", a song from his debut album, \"The Love Experience\". Thundercat's \"Them Changes\" from his 2015 record \"The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam\" also quotes the famous drum kit opening of the song.\n\nErnie Isley's playing on this track is heavily influenced by artists such as Jimi Hendrix, whose first recording session was actually with the Isley Brothers in 1964 with the track \"Testify\". \n\nErnie Isley not only played guitar but also played drums and wrote the lyrics to \"Footsteps in the Dark\".

It intends to assist individuals and businesses to improve their organizing systems and process, for the purpose of improving quality of life, increasing personal productivity and achieving greater efficiency.\n\nThe National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals (NAPO) is recognised as the largest professional association within this industry, with approximately 3,500 members.\n\nThis industry has been popularised by a number of television programs produced on the subject, beginning with \"Life Laundry\" in 2002. This was followed by other programs, such as \"Clean Sweep\", \"Neat\", \"\", \"Hoarding: Buried Alive,\" \"Hoarders\", and . Professional organizing has also been the basis of magazines like \"Real Simple\".\n\nNAPO defines Professional Organizer and Productivity Consultant as follows:\n\nCertified Professional Organizers (CPOs) have proven industry proficiency by demonstrating they possess the body of knowledge and experience essential to professional organizing and productivity consulting. The CPO® credential identifies professional organizers who’ve documented a specific number of paid hours that include transferring organizing skills to the client, and passed the Board of Certification for Professional Organizers (BCPO®) examination. The credential provides the organizing and productivity industry a way to elevate its professional standards.\n\nThe National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals' education arm is known as NAPO University. Currently NAPO University offers two Specialist Certificates: Residential Organizing and Workplace Productivity. A third Specialist Certificate in Life Transitions will be launched in early 2018. NAPO University also offers a Business Resources Track to support Professional Organizers and Productivity Consultants in developing and growing their businesses.\n\nProfessional Organizers achieve the goal of creating and maintaining organizational systems by teaching others the basic principals of organization. Writer Julie Morgenstern suggests communicating these principals by using the acronym \"SPACE\", interpreted as: S=Sort, P=Purge, A=Assign a Home, C=Containerize and E=Equalize. The last step (\"E\") consists in monitoring how the new system that has been created is working, adjusting it if needed, and maintaining it. This principle is applicable to every type of organization.\n\nAs one of their main jobs, Professional Organizers help clients reduce excessive clutter (paper, books, clothing, shoes, office supplies, home decor items, etc.) in the home or in the office. Professional Organizers endeavor to help individuals and business owners take control of their surroundings, their time, their paper, and their systems for life. Professional Organizers help redirect paradigms into more useful cross-applications that ensure properly co-sustainable futures for their clients' spaces and processes.\n\nProfessional Organizers offer a wide variety of services, from designing a functional closet, to organizing a cross-country move. For homeowners, a Professional Organizer might plan and reorganize the space of a room, improve paper management, or coach in time-management, or goal-setting.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706022", "text": "San Agustinillo\n\nSan Agustinillo is a small fishing village and beach in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is located in the municipality of Santa María Tonameca just east of the coastal communities of Mazunte and La Ventanilla. This is where the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains meet the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSan Agustinillo is connected by a road to Zipolite and Puerto Ángel to the west. All these coastal communities together are known as the \"Riviera Oaxaqueña or \"La Costa Chica Oaxaqueña.\n\nThe local Highway 175 makes a loop south from the main coastal Highway 200. From Pochutla, Highway 175 first goes south to Puerto Ángel, then west along the coast to Zipolite, San Agustinillo, and Mazunte. After that, it continues back north again to rejoin the main Highway 200. The local 'collectivos' buses make trips from Pochutla in both directions.\n\nThe community was established about the same time as Mazunte. Fishermen in San Augustinillo made a living by hunting sea turtles until this was banned in 1990. Major economic activities here for most residents are still agriculture and small scale fishing, with some tourism, based on the beach.\n\nThe beach of San Agustinillo is about 1300 meters long, facing open ocean, and divided into three sections by rocky outcroppings that jut out from the beach into the Pacific Ocean. The sands of the beach are medium grain, of gold color, and spread as wide as fifty meters. The waters just offshore are warm with green and blue tones. The far west end is called Playa Rinconcito, which is relatively well-sheltered and considered safest for swimming. The easternmost section is called Playa Aragon and has both strong waves and strong undertow. As these beaches face open ocean caution is advised, especially when tropical waves and other weather phenomena cause abnormally high waves, which can cause beach restrictions and closures. In 2009, at least three drownings were reported off this beach, including a six-year-old girl who was caught while on the shoreline by an unusually high wave. A nineteen-year-old was dragged out to sea when he was surprised by an undercurrent, and his body was not found until five days later.\n\nThe fishing village is located at the far west end at Playa Rinconcito. The fishermen offer boat tours of the area as well as rental for sportsfishing. Just immediately to the east of the village are palapas but almost nothing has been built at the far eastern end. From June to December it is possible to see Olive Ridley turtles laying their eggs on this beach.\n\nThe beach is encroached by hills and steep cliffs that make the building of large hotels and other resort features impossible. However, the shoreline and some of the hills surrounding it are dotted with small rustic establishments which show ecological and European influence. The European influence is because a number of establishments here are owned by Italians and some French. Restaurants include La Termita, owned by an Italian-Argentinian, and Tio Nerone, owned by an Italian-German. The Mexico Lindo hotel on the beach is owned by a Mexican from Tabasco by the name of Fausto and also serves Italian food along with Regional favorites. Another Italian-owned lodging is the Posada La Termita, also on the waterfront. Casa Pan de Miel has a French owner. It is not on the beach but on a hilltop overlooking the area.\n\nSince the area emphasizes eco tourism, many of the lodgings here were built as “low-impact” that blend in with the topography. One of this is La Posada del Arquitecto which is carved into the rocks of Playa Rinconcito. The rooms have hanging beds and a shower built into a tree trunk. Everything is constructed with wooden pegs instead of nails. Many of the lodgings here do not have websites or even phones but are popular with backpackers nonetheless. None have running hot water. Most hotels do not have televisions, phone or wireless connections, or air conditioning.\n\nThe library of San Agustinillo is called “Las cuatro amigas” referring to the four women who opened it in the Casa Municipal (municipal office building) on Highway 175. The library is free to residents, and tourists may borrow books for a nominal fee. About half the collection is in Spanish, about half in English, and the rest in other languages such as French and German. The library also offers English classes for the children of the town. The organization that runs the library has a website at La Biblioteca de San Agustinillo.\n\n", "id": "7706022", "categories": ["Populated places in Oaxaca"], "title": "San Agustinillo"}

Nissim ben Reuben (RaN), Ibn Ḥabib wrote a commentary on the \"halachot\" of Isaac Alfasi, entitled \"Nimmuḳe Yosef,\" published with the text and the commentary of R. Nissim (Constantinople, 1509). Against the opinion of David Conforte (\"Ḳore ha-Dorot,\" p. 26a) that Ibn Ḥabib availed himself to write commentaries only upon those treatises which R. Nissim had omitted, Azulai (\"Shem ha-Gedolim\") proved that Ibn Ḥabib's \"Nimmuḳe Yosef\" covered the entire \"halachot\" of Isaac Alfasi, but a part of it had remained unpublished, and that the commentary to the \"halachot\" of Moed Katan and Makkot, attributed to R. Nissim, belongs to Ibn Ḥabib. The latter quotes Asher ben Jehiel, Yom-Tob ben Abraham, his master RaM, and R. Nissim himself. The \"Nimmuḳe Yosef\" on Ketubot and Nedarim was also included in the work \"Ishei Adonai\" (Leghorn, 1795), and the portion on Shebuot in the \"Bet ha-Beḥirah\" (ib. 1795). Azulai says that Ibn Ḥabib was the author of \"novellæ\" on the whole Talmud.\n\n", "id": "7706115", "categories": ["14th-century rabbis", "Spanish rabbis", "15th-century rabbis"], "title": "Joseph ibn Habib"}

Tamborine Mountain, Lever's Plateau and the Lamington Plateau are part of the rim formation. The scenic rim is considered part of the Gold Coast hinterland. Parts of the rim are well developed, crossed by highways with facilities for tourists like Cunninghams Gap, others are privately owned agricultural properties and rural villages such as Beechmont and Tamborine Mountain. Much of the rest is protected in national parks and nature reserves.\n\nThe ranges include the Little Liverpool Range, Main Range, Mistake Ranges, McPherson Range, Teviot Range and the Tweed Range. Valleys of the Scenic Rim include Laidley Creek, Christmas Creek, Lockyer Valley, Fassifern Valley, Numinbah Valley, the Albert River, Logan River, Coomera River and the Bremer River.\n\nThe geology and landscape of the Scenic Rim is largely volcanic in origin, deriving from the prehistoric Tweed Volcano, including the Mount Warning shield volcano, and the Focal Peak and Main Range volcanic rocks. Some areas of sedimentary origin include parts of Mount Barney and eastern Lamington national parks. The deeply weathered, mainly basaltic, soils support rainforest and vine thicket ecosystems, as well as rare eucalypt and grassland communities. The area has a subtropical climate with (at the lowest altitudes) average minimum winter temperatures of 6°C, average maximum summer temperatures of 29°C, and average annual rainfall of 1555 mm.\n\nAreas protected in national parks and other conservation reserves include the Border Ranges National Park, Glen Rock Regional Park, Koreelah National Park, Lamington National Park, Limpinwood Nature Reserve, Main Range National Park, Mebbin National Park, Moogerah Peaks National Park, Mount Barney National Park, Mount Chinghee National Park, Mount Clunie National Park, Mount Nothofagus National Park, Mount Warning National Park, Numinbah Nature Reserve and Springbrook National Park. Parts of the Scenic Rim are listed as a World Heritage site, and some are designated Wilderness Areas.\n\nA 1351 km area encompassing the Scenic Rim has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of endangered eastern bristlebirds, black-breasted button-quails, rufous scrub-birds, Albert's lyrebirds, pale-yellow robins, paradise riflebirds, green catbirds, regent bowerbirds and Australian logrunners. There are also historical and recent sight records of the critically endangered Coxen's fig parrot.\n\nThere are many recreational activities for day-trippers, rockclimbers, hikers and nature lovers on the ranges. The concept of the Scenic Rim was first described by Arthur Groom and Romeo Lahey in the 1920s. They were campaigning for the protection of the forests from Main Range to the Lamington Plateau. At about the same time the Binna Burra lodge and O'Reilly's Guesthouse were established as the popularity of the area grew with tourists.\n\n\n", "id": "7706123", "categories": ["Mountains of Queensland", "Mountains of New South Wales", "Important Bird Areas of Queensland", "Important Bird Areas of New South Wales", "South East Queensland"], "title": "Scenic Rim"}

This helped him win support and influence over the area's residents. In the 1920s and 1930s, Hines maintained \"absolute power\" over his district and was arguably the most powerful political boss in Tammany Hall.\n\nJimmy Walker's election as Mayor of New York City would also firmly establish Hines' influence over the local political scene As boss of Tammany Hall's Eleventh Assembly District in uptown Manhattan, Hines had access to various sources of wealth and developed close ties with many mobsters such as Lucky Luciano., leader of the city's dominant Luciano crime family.\n\nIn 1932, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for President and wanted to weaken Tammany Hall. Walker, who was tainted by allegations of corruption and was a threat to Roosevelt's campaign, into resigning. Seeing Tammany Hall as a political liability, Roosevelt decided to appoint a new mayor, a privilege the New York Governor had after any mayor of New York City resigned, and focused on backing a candidate who would destroy Tammany Hall's power for good.\n\nLiberal Republican Fiorello LaGuardia, a former Representative and a fierce opponent of Tammany Hall whom Hines had successfully forced from power in the 1932 Congressional election, was elected mayor in 1933, and Tammany Hall's longtime influence over local politicians faded. Hines would not fall. After becoming President, Roosevelt appointed Hines to oversee the U.S. civil service's patronage system for employees in the Manhattan District. Hines' empire grew soon afterward.\n\nIn 1938, Hines was accused of being involved in the policy racket with Dutch Schultz (who was murdered in 1935) and Dixie Davis and of violating the \"lottery laws\". Manhattan District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey would successfully get Hines convicted on 13 counts of racketeering. Hines provided protection for the policy racket in Harlem and other sections of New York. Hines was charged with influencing Magistrates Capshaw and Erwin to throw out policy cases in which the other conspirators had an interest and to influence former District Attorney William C. Dodge to 'go easy' on policy prosecutions. Hines was alleged to have received a cut in the proceeds of the policy racket.\n\nAfter the first trial ended in a mistrial, he was charged again and Charles Cooper Nott, Jr. presided over the second trial.\n\nHe died on March 26, 1957 at the Long Beach Memorial Hospital.\n\n", "id": "7706131", "categories": ["Numbers game", "American people of Irish descent", "Leaders of Tammany Hall", "1957 deaths", "1876 births"], "title": "James Joseph Hines"}

Leisure Vehicles, Inc. was founded by Bob Bracey, who had assisted in developing the legendary Ford Mark IV Le Mans race cars a few years earlier, while an engineer at Kar Kraft.\n\nRaider snowmobiles are unique for their use of a rear-mounted engine, twin track design, and cockpit seating, all of which were revolutionary ideas for the snowmobile industry in the 1970s.\n\nThe first production model year was 1971, though the sled had been in development since 1969. There were two 1971 models, the Raider and the Roamer. The 1971 Raider featured a single cylinder JLO 2-stroke engine in the beginning of the model year, but later may have switched to CCW. The 1971 Roamer featured a 10 hp Briggs & Stratton 4 cycle engine. The production numbers are unknown, but it is believed that approximately 50 '71 Roamers and 50 '71 Raiders were produced. 1971 Raiders and Roamers featured a twist grip throttle, which was found to be hard to control in bumpy conditions.\n\nThe 1972 Raider was significantly redesigned from the 1971 model year. It was larger, longer, featured redesigned tracks, longer skis, and rear shocks, along with the leaf sprung rear skids, and many more Raider specific manufactured parts. For the 1972 model year, there were four Raider models; the 290, 340, 400, and 440. The number represents the size of the CCW engine for each model. The most common seem to be the 400cc, followed by the 290cc. This was probably due to engine availability. Most have electric starting. Some '72 440 models have been found with Hirth engines. 400 models are most often found with a standard tachometer; and 440 models came standard with a tach, and a speedometer.\n\nThere was a limited production Raider built in 1972 and intended for racing called the \"Bandit\". Production is thought to be around 100 units. All were put together at a separate facility from the LVI factory. It had a lighter weight body, front ski shocks (the first time on a Raider), and a different hatch design, that had air scoops instead of a passenger seat. The body is black and white, and it has a single wide white plastic snow flap, with \"bandit\" lettered in black, and black and white stripes on the front. Most Bandits were built with Hirth fan cooled twin cylinder engines, but a few have been found with CCW engines. Bandits were to be built in 340, 400, and 440 models, but at least one 650 fan cooled Hirth powered Bandit has been found. The Hirth powered Bandits have been found with twin carbs, and two small round Donaldson mufflers. The Bandits were intended for racing, but were found to be too heavy to be competitive. All were built by hand, so each is a little different. The only Bandit seen in Raider advertising is in the background of one artists rendering of a 72 Raider on snow.\n\nIn 1973, the Raider snowmobile was again completely redesigned. There were two models available in 1973, the 34TT and the 44TT. The 34TT featured a 32 hp, 400cc CCW engine. No one knows why the 34TT is not called the 40TT or alternatively, powered by a 340cc engine. It must heve been a last minute change, or the fact that the 400cc engine was more readily available. \nThe 44TT featured a 36 hp, 440cc CCW engine. There are also a few '73 Raiders that have been found with older '72 style 340cc CCW engines in the stripped down version that would be called the \"Hawk\" in 1974. \nThe engine on the 1973 design was tilted to allow for the longer intake on the newer CCW engines, with a larger carburetor. This had the added benefit of lowering the center of gravity, and reducing vibration.\n\nThe 1974 Raider Snowmobiles experienced a few revisions from the 1973 model. The biggest changes were revised graphics on the snowmobile. The 1974 model year also marked the change of the Raider lineup into three distinct models, the Hawk, Eagle, and Double Eagle. Most 1974 Eagle Raiders are actually unsold 1973 Raider 34TT and 44TT model inventory. Many 1973 Raiders had gone unsold due to industry wide overproduction, poor snow in most of the midwest, and the OPEC oil embargo. Raider dealers were sent an \"upgrade kit\" with new 1974 style decals, the black front applique, and a new 1974 owner's manual. The dealer service bulletin reminded dealers to \"be sure to remove the 1973 owner's manual & replace it with the 1974 owner's manual\". \nThe 1974 Hawk was a stripped down Raider model. It had no gauges, no electric start, no front ski shocks, no brake lights, no hinged gas door cover, and no passenger seat. It came equipped with a 340cc CCW engine, with the '72 Raider style smaller intake and carburator, and '72 Raider wiring and chrome brake and throttle controls, and the '72 style dash mounted toggle light and high beam switch. The '74 Hawk seems to have been a way for LVI to use up left-over '72 Raider parts, and at the same time, have a cheaper entry level sled.\nThe 1974 Double Eagle was again a completely new, redesigned sled. It was slightly larger and used a more advanced coil sprung rear suspension technology than the Hawk and Eagle models. It also featured an injection molded body, hatch and pan, and a wider front ski stance. This final redesign was intended to reduce the total number of parts needed to build the machine, and therefore speed up production. \n\nThe 1975 model year was to see the end of Raider production. Very few 1975 Raider snowmobiles were manufactured, and included a revised 440 Double Eagle that was now burnt orange, as opposed to harvest gold as seen in 1974. The 1975 \"Eagle\" that was now light blue and powered by a 340cc engine. There was no \"Eagle\" bird decal on the light blue '75 340s, though they are still known as the '75 Eagle for some reason. All 1975 Raiders were now powered by Kohler AS/2 fan cooled twin cylinder engines with CDI ignition. John Deere had negotiated an exclusive contract for CCW/Kioritz engines, forcing LVI/Raider to find a new engine source.\n\nLeisure Vehicles had intended to create a two-person, side-by-side Raider designated as the Twin Eagle for 1975, but only a few prototypes were built.\n\n1975 was a tumultuous year for Leisure Vehicles, due to a poor snow season, increasing emission and noise level restrictions, the departure of Bob Bracey from the company, and an industry wide shake-out and contraction. As a result of these problems, and many others, the company halted production on the Raider.\n\nBob Bracey said that total Raider production was about 20,000 units.\n\n", "id": "7706238", "categories": [], "title": "Raider Snowmobiles"}

Tudor\n\nSimon Woodson Tudor (November 5, 1887—May 10, 1956) was a prominent educator, businessman, church and civic leader, and philanthropist in the central Louisiana city of Pineville in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nTudor was born in Madison County, Kentucky, to James A. Tudor and the former Malinda Alice Turner. He was educated first at Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky. He then relocated to Pineville, which is located east of the Red River from the larger city of Alexandria.\n\nTudor received his bachelor's degree in 1913 from Baptist-affiliated Louisiana College in Pineville. While he attended Louisiana College, he was also the athletic director and the football, basketball, and baseball coach from 1910 to 1913 and again, after his graduation, from 1914 to 1917. He coached at the Methodist-affiliated Centenary College in Shreveport in 1912. He taught school in Vernon Parish from 1913 to 1914. He concluded his brief educational career as a principal in Pineville public schools from 1917 to 1920.\n\nOn September 21, 1913, Tudor married the former Frances Ollie Beall (1894–1992), the daughter of William Columbus Beall and the former Sarah Frances Curry. They had a son, Robert Beall Tudor, Sr. (1914–1987), and a daughter, Dorothy Louise Tudor. Tudor's grandson Michael Simon Tudor (born 1945) is an attorney who has been active in the leadership of the Republican Party in Rapides Parish. Another grandson, Robert Beall \"Buddy\" Tudor, Jr., expanded the family construction business statewide after he graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.\n\nIn 1920, Tudor entered the real estate business, both residential and commercial buildings. In 1946, he founded his Tudor Construction Company and served as the company president until his death.\n\nTudor was a deacon of the First Baptist Church of Pineville and a member of the Louisiana College trustess from 1941 until his death. He was the trustees president from 1943 to 1953. A generous benefactor to the college, Tudor was honored by the naming of the men's dormitory \"Tudor Hall\".\n\nTudor thereafter donated twenty-seven acres of land to Louisiana College for several construction projects undertaken during the administration of LC president G. Earl Guinn.\n\nTudor is interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in Pineville.\n\n", "id": "7706240", "categories": ["Louisiana College Wildcats football coaches", "People from Madison County, Kentucky", "People from Alexandria, Louisiana", "American men's basketball players", "1956 deaths", "Baptists from Kentucky", "College men's basketball players in the United States", "Georgetown College (Kentucky) alumni", "American construction businesspeople", "American real estate businesspeople", "Baptists from Louisiana", "Louisiana College alumni", "Louisiana College Wildcats athletic directors", "American philanthropists", "1887 births", "Louisiana College Wildcats baseball coaches", "Educators from Louisiana"], "title": "Simon W.

The WAMi Awards are Western Australia Music's night of nights, bringing together local music fans and members of local, national and international industry to acknowledge and celebrate another year of achievements for Western Australia.\n\nWAM was originally formed as the Western Australian Rock Music Industry Association Inc. (WARMIA) in 1985, with its main aim to develop and run annual awards recognising achievements within the music industry in Western Australia. WAM first received project funding from the state government in 1989, and in the early 1990s the word \"rock\" was dropped from the title to give the organisation scope to take on a broader constituency.\n\nIn 1994 the inaugural Kiss My WAMi Original Contemporary Music Festival was held. Other programs that have been successfully undertaken include the Act of Youth series of all-ages shows, the WA Song Contest (now WAM Song of the Year), Women in Rock and an annual CD compilation of Western Australian musical artists (the first \"The Western Front\" was undertaken in 1992 and featured \"The Pink Fluffy Bunnies\", \"Allegiance\" and \"Storytime\" amongst others.)\n\nThe 2001 WAMi Awards commenced with an opening party on Thursday 13 September 2001 and a closing party at the Globe Theatre on Sunday 16 September 2001.\n\nWAM's annual original contemporary music festival celebrated its 10th birthday in 2003. The metro component of the Kiss My WAMi Festival ran from Thursday 4 September through to Sunday 14 September.\n\n\nIn 2004 WAM took the decision to instigate a new \"WAM Hall of Fame\". The intention is to induct people who have made outstanding contributions to the Western Australian contemporary music industry into this Hall of Fame each year during the WAMi Festival.\n\nThe collection of luminaries of the Western Australian music industry were recognised with a presentation ceremony at the WAMi Weekender opening party held in Foundation Week, 3–8 June 2004.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706362", "text": "Your Love (The Outfield song)\n\n“Your Love” is a song by the English rock band the Outfield, taken from their debut album \"Play Deep\" (1985). The song was written by the band’s guitarist John Spinks.\n\nIn the United States, the song reached #6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and #7 on the Mainstream Rock chart in 1986.\n\n“Your Love” became a major hit in the United States. It was first released as the second single from \"Play Deep\" in November 1985. It was first pushed to album-oriented rock (AOR) radio, to maintain momentum generated by the album's lead single, “Say It Isn’t So”. After entering the top ten of \"Billboard\" Top Rock Tracks chart (which measured the playlists of AOR stations across the U.S.), Columbia began expanding the song to top 40 radio in February 1986. It then peaked at number seven on the Top Rock Tracks chart during the week of March 1. The song entered the top ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in May 1986, peaking at number six during the week of May 10. Overall, it spent 22 weeks on the Hot 100.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" contributor Jimmy Guterman wrote that the track \"seems to advocate philandering,\" and that \"the repulsive misogyny contaminates the whole song.\" While Dennis Hunt from the \"Los Angeles Times\" criticized the whole of \"Play Deep\" as \"thoroughly derivative music,\" he praised the song's \"lovely melodic line that's engagingly performed by vocalist Tony Lewis, who has obviously been listening to Journey's Steve Perry.\"\n\nThe music video has an extended intro and was directed by Jon Jopson. The concept for the clip has the band filming a music video for the song, and prominently features a painting motif (similar to the cover of the album from which the song was taken). They perform in front of a backdrop of the \"Play Deep\" album cover, which is also being finger-painted offstage by an artist, played by actress JoAnn Willette. Her character and lead vocalist Tony Lewis appear flirtatious throughout the video. Willette was interviewed about her role on the blog Noblemania in 2013, and gave details about the shoot; it was shot in Astoria on a soundstage over one day. At the end of the video, Willette can be seen exiting the studio at dawn, the time the production wrapped. The band appears mainly as playing the song, highlighting their unity as a performing band: \"We didn't want a situation where they had to be actors or something that wasn't what they are,\" said the band's manager, Kip Krones, at the time.\n\nThe video was first added to MTV's schedule during the week of 19 February 1986, and began attracting major rotation. It peaked at number two on MTV's Top 20 Countdown in late April 1986.\n", "id": "7706362", "categories": ["Songs about sexuality", "1985 songs", "Columbia Records singles", "The Outfield songs", "1985 singles", "Debut singles"], "title": "Your Love (The Outfield song)"}

All Russian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses through superior French infantry and artillery firepower. French casualties amounted to 1,200 men, while the Russians lost 2,548.\n\nDavout's victory prevented the Russian Second Western Army under Bagration from joining the First Western Army of Barclay de Tolly at Vitebsk but could not stop Bagration from effecting the link-up later at Smolensk.\n\nAvoiding French envelopment attempts at the beginning of the invasion, the Russian Second Western Army under Prince Pyotr Bagration was ordered on 7 July to join, via Mogilev, the First Western Army of Barclay de Tolly. Bagration was threatened with encirclement by French emperor Napoleon's forces under King Jerome to the west and Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's I Corps to the north. The Russian Prince moved rapidly to cross the Dnieper river at Mogilev to link up with Barclay. Davout was faster, however, and 28,000 of his troops took Mogilev on 20 July. The Russians arrived before Mogilev on 21 July and their vanguard under Colonel Vasily Sysoev drove out Davout's forward detachments near the village of Dashkovka to the south of Mogilev.\n\nBagration had 45,000 men available but assigned only General Nikolay Raevsky's 17,000–20,000-strong VII Corps to attack Davout. Bagration's order was essentially for an aggressive reconnaissance in force. Depending on the strength of the French, Raevsky would either drive the French out and capture Orsha, thereby covering the First Western Army's crossing of the Dnieper or delay them long enough for Bagration to cross south of Mogilev.\n\nWeakened by the transferral of his troops elsewhere and fatigue, Davout had 21,500–28,000 effectives on hand at Mogilev, including 22,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry, in three infantry division under generals Jean Dominique Compans, Joseph Marie Dessaix and Michel Marie Claparède and cavalry under generals Étienne de Bordesoule and Valence. Davout deployed his forces at Saltanovka, a naturally strong position. The left flank was covered by the bogs of the Dnieper. A stream ran through a ravine across his front, with a bridge inside Saltanovka. The village itself was surrounded by forests. Davout constructed earthworks to strengthen his line, fortified the buildings on the main road and set up artillery batteries. The bridge at Fatova was destroyed.\n\nAt 07:00 on 23 July, VII Corps' advance guard of two Jäger battalions under Colonel Andre Glebov drove out Davout's outposts on the French left flank. By 08:00, the bridge on the left was in Russian hands and the Jäger continued their advance. Davout deployed the 85th Line Regiment for a counterattack, backed by artillery. The Russian attack failed as crushing French artillery and infantry firepower mowed down the unprotected Russian infantry, who died where they stood rather than break for cover.\n\nWhile the Russian attack was faltering, Bagration sent Raevsky a new order to storm Mogilev.\n\nThe 26th Infantry Division under Ivan Paskevich assaulted Fatova in extended column formation, forcing I/85 to retreat. Davout sent a battalion of the 108th Line Regiment and some artillery to help out. The two French battalions redeployed on the heights south of Fatova and defeated the Russian attacks. Backed by 12 guns, Paskevich opened another assault that bashed through the French defenders to take the village. Past Fatova, Davout had prepared an ambush with four battalions from the 108th Line, lying low amidst the wheat fields behind the village. The concealed French troops launched a devastating counterattack that caused heavy losses on the Russians and threw them back in disarray. Fatova was recaptured by the French. Paskevich attacked and captured the village again. Davout now moved forward the 61st Line from his reserve. All Russian attacks were repulsed and on the right, two French battalions overran the Nizhniy-Novgorod and Orlov regiments, crossing the stream. Paskevich deployed the Poltava regiment to prevent his right flank from being enveloped.\n\nThe Russian attack's main point of effort was Saltanovka. Raevsky personally led the Smolensk Infantry Regiment to capture a dam and shield the attack of his main force. The 6th and 42nd Jäger Regiments would act as support, along with artillery on both sides of the main road. Paskevich's assault on Fatova would take place at the same time. Raevsky blundered, however, not hearing the agreed-upon artillery fire that would signal the advance. His own attack started too late. French artillery inflicted huge losses on Raevsky's men. Raevsky personally led a charge, allegedly with his 11 and 16-year old sons Nikolai and Aleksandr (although Raevsky denied it), but the attempt failed regardless. French prisoners informed Raevsky that French reinforcements were on the way. Bagration ordered a full retreat to Dashkovka. Davout attacked the Russian rearguard later that day but did not achieve a result. Tolstoy gives an account of the storming of the dam in War And Peace, Book III, Chapter 12 when an officer describes the event to a sceptical Count Nikolai.\n\nThe Second Western Army constructed a bridge south of Mogilev at Novy Bikhov and crossed the Dnieper toward Smolensk. The battle prevented Bagration from joining the First Western Army under Barclay de Tolly at Vitebsk, forcing Bagration to retreat to Smolensk. Saltanovka is generally seen as a French victory but despite failing to link up with Barclay at Vitebsk, Bagration accomplished his objective of joining the main Russian force later at Smolensk, and avoided Napoleon's encirclement.\n\nThe Russian losses were 2,548 men killed and wounded, although Marshal Davout officially declared that they lost 1,200 dead and 4,000 wounded. Davout admitted to only 900 casualties, which include 100 prisoners from the 108th line regiment and were officially reported by him. The Russians claimed French casualties of 4,134 killed, wounded and missing. Actual French losses were about 1,200.\n\n", "id": "7706373", "categories": ["Battles of the Napoleonic Wars", "French invasion of Russia", "July 1812 events", "1812 in the Russian Empire", "Battles involving Russia", "Conflicts in 1812", "1812 in Belarus"], "title": "Battle of Saltanovka"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706386", "text": "Cyber Empires\n\nCyber Empires (known as Steel Empire in Europe) is a strategy/top-view fighting game produced by Silicon Knights. The game was produced in MS-DOS, Atari ST and Amiga versions, and was originally released in March 1992. The current copyright holder was Strategic Simulations, Inc., which later became part of Ubisoft.\n\nThe game has two basic components. The first requires the player to engage in Risk-like strategic decision-making with the goal of conquering the given land mass. The player raises cyborg armies to accomplish this goal. During the second basic component of the game, the top-down battle mode, players can choose to assume manual control of one cyborg in their army during offensive or defensive battle sessions, or let the computer simulate the battle behind the scenes to much more predictable outcomes. This allows players to play only the Risk-style board game component of the game. The opposite, battles only, is also possible. Cyber Empires innovated by mixing strategy with arcade action on a global scale.\n\nThe game offers a total of nine different cyborgs from which the user can create an army of up to 10 units, that is no more 10 units may occupy one country. The units range from the small fast mercury capable of little damage but a high speed, to the Titan which is the ultimate cyborg capable of long range missile attacks and short range auto-cannon attacks.\n\nThe strategy part of the game allows the user to place capitols in any countries occupied by their troops. Countries with capitols in them create extra revenue every turn and can be built upon. The buildings includes fortifications, factories and factory upgrades. Fortifications comes in 3 varieties: light, medium and heavy, but can only protect a country if at least one cyborg is present. Factories come in 3 varieties also, they can have 1, 2 or 4 bays. The number of bays a factory is determined the number of cyborgs it can build at once. The upgrade level of a factory, on the other hand, determines how fast an individual cyborg can be built.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" warned that \"Cyber Empires\" was an action game with strategic elements and that it was not well suited for strategy-only players. The magazine called it \"a solid game. It has nothing to rave about and nothing that hobbles it\", with \"adequate\" graphics and sound, and recommended the game to action gamers who were \"fans of BattleTech, RoboTech and Giant Robot universes\". A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game two-plus stars out of five.\n\n", "id": "7706386", "categories": ["Strategic Simulations games", "Amiga games", "Atari ST games", "Video games developed in Canada", "1992 video games", "Turn-based strategy video games", "DOS games", "Science fiction video games", "Computer wargames", "Action video games", "Silicon Knights games"], "title": "Cyber Empires"}

It is the largest synagogue in Europe, seating 3,000 people and is a centre of Neolog Judaism.\n\nThe synagogue was built between 1854 and 1859 in the Moorish Revival style, with the decoration based chiefly on Islamic models from North Africa and medieval Spain (the Alhambra). The synagogue's Viennese architect, Ludwig Förster, believed that no distinctively Jewish architecture could be identified, and thus chose \"\"architectural forms that have been used by oriental ethnic groups that are related to the Israelite people, and in particular the Arabs\"\". The interior design is partly by Frigyes Feszl.\n\nThe Dohány Street Synagogue complex consists of the Great Synagogue, the Heroes' Temple, the graveyard, the Memorial and the Jewish Museum, which was built on the site on which Theodor Herzl's house of birth stood. Dohány Street itself, a leafy street in the city center, carries strong Holocaust connotations as it constituted the border of the Budapest Ghetto.\n\nBuilt in a residential area between 1854-1859 by the Jewish community of Pest according to the plans of Ludwig Förster, the monumental synagogue has a capacity of 2,964 seats (1,492 for men and 1,472 in the women's galleries), making it the largest in Europe and one of the largest working synagogues in the world (after the Beit Midrash of Ger in Jerusalem, the Belz Great Synagogue and Temple Emanu-el in New York City). The consecration of the synagogue took place on 6 September 1859.\n\nThe synagogue was bombed by the Hungarian pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party on 3 February 1939. Used as a base for German Radio and also as a stable during World War II, the building suffered some severe damage from aerial raids during the Nazi Occupation but especially during the Siege of Budapest. During the Communist era, the damaged structure became again a prayer house for the much-diminished Jewish community. Its restoration and renovation started in 1991, financed by the state and by private donations, and was completed in 1998 (see below).\n\nThe building is long and wide. The style of the Dohány Street Synagogue is Moorish but its design also features a mixture of Byzantine, Romantic and Gothic elements. Two onion domes sit on the twin octagonal towers at height. A rose stained-glass window sits over the main entrance.\n\nSimilarly to basilicas, the building consists of three spacious richly decorated aisles, two balconies and, unusually, an organ. Its ark contains various torah scrolls taken from other synagogues destroyed during the Holocaust.\n\nThe Central Synagogue in Manhattan, New York City is a near-exact copy of the Dohány Street Synagogue.\n\nThe torah-ark and the internal frescoes made of colored and golden geometric shapes are the works of the famous Hungarian romantic architect Frigyes Feszl. A single-span cast iron supports the nave. The seats on the ground-floor are for men, while the upper gallery, supported by steel ornamented poles, has seats for women. This synagogue is very different from other synagogues as it is the only one to have pipe organs and a cemetery.\n\nFranz Liszt and Camille Saint-Saëns played the original 5,000-pipe organ built in 1859. A new mechanical organ with 63 voices and four manuals was built in 1996 by the German firm Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden GmbH. One of the most important concerts in the Synagogue's history was in 2002, by the organ virtuoso Xaver Varnus. A crowd of 7,200 filled sanctuary seats and standing space some four hours before the concert to hear the artist’s virtuosity.\nIt was only in the 1990s, following the return to democracy in Hungary, that renovations could begin. The three-year program of reconstruction was initially funded by a US$5 million donation from Hungarian government. Jewish Americans Estée Lauder and Tony Curtis contributed to the additional $20,000,000 needed to complete the restoration in 1996.\n\nThe Hungarian Jewish Museum was constructed on the plot where Theodor Herzl's two-story Classicist style house stood, adjoining the Dohány synagogue. The Jewish Museum was built in 1930 in accordance with the synagogue's architectural style and attached in 1931 to the main building. It holds the \"Jewish Religious and Historical Collection\", a collection of religious relics of the Pest Hevrah Kaddishah (Jewish Burial Society), ritual objects of Shabbat and the High Holidays and a Holocaust room.\n\nThe arcade and the Heroes' Temple, which seats 250 people and is used for religious services on weekdays and during the winter time, was added to the Dohány Street Synagogue complex in 1931. The Heroes' Temple was designed by Lázlo Vágó and Ferenc Faragó and serves as a memorial to Hungarian Jews who gave their lives during World War I.\nIn 1944, the Dohány Street Synagogue was part of the Jewish Ghetto for the city Jews and served as shelter for many hundreds. Over two thousand of those who died in the ghetto from hunger and cold during the winter 1944-1945 are buried in the courtyard of the synagogue.\n\nIt is not customary to have a cemetery next to a synagogue, and the establishment of the 3,000 m cemetery was only the result of historical circumstances. In 1944, as a part of the Eichmann-plan, 70,000 Jews were relocated to the Ghetto of Pest. Until 18 January 1945, when the Russians liberated the ghetto, around 8,000 to 10,000 people had died, although, one part of the deceased were transferred to the Kozma Street Cemetery, but 2,000 people were buried in the makeshift cemetery. In memory of those who had died, there is a memorial by the sculptor, Imre Varga, depicting a weeping willow with the names and tattoo numbers of the dead and disappeared just behind the Synagogue, in the Raoul Wallenberg Holocaust Memorial Park.\n\nThe Raoul Wallenberg Emlékpark (memory park) in the rear courtyard holds the \"Memorial of the Hungarian Jewish Martyrs\" — at least 400,000 Hungarian Jews were murdered by the Nazis. Made by Imre Varga, it resembles a weeping willow whose leaves bear inscriptions with the names of victims. There is also a memorial to Wallenberg and other Righteous Among the Nations, among them: Swiss Vice-consul Carl Lutz; Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian man who, with a strategic escamotage, declared himself the Spanish consul, releasing documents of protection and current passports to Jews in Budapest without distinction (he saved five thousand); Mons. Angelo Rotta, an Italian Prelate Bishop and Apostolic Nuncio of the State of Vatican City in Budapest, which issued protective sheets, misrepresentations of baptism (to save them from forced labor) and Vatican passports to Jews, without distinction of any kind present in Budapest (saving fifteen thousand), who saved, with his secretary Mons. Gennaro Verolino tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II. Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho a Portuguese diplomat, serving as Portugal’s Chargé d'Affaires in Budapest in 1944, issued protective Passports to hundreds of Jewish families, altogether about 1,000 lives were saved due to his actions. Carlos Sampaio Garrido the Portuguese Ambassador who resisted the Hungarian political police when the police raided his home arresting his guests. The Ambassador physically resisted the police and was also arrested but managed to have his guests released by invoking the extraterritorial legal rights of diplomatic legations; five of the guests were members of the famous Gabor family.\n\nDohány means tobacco in Hungarian, a loan word from Ottoman Turkish دخان (duhân), itself borrowed from Arabic (duḫḫān). A similar Turkish loanword for tobacco is used throughout the Balkans (e.g., duhan in Bosnian).\n\nTheodor Herzl in his speeches and the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" referred to the Dohány Street Synagogue as the Tabakgasse Synagogue. The Dohány Street Synagogue is also known under the name of the \"Tabak-Shul\", the Yiddish translation of Dohány Synagogue.\n\nOn 23 October 2012, an Israeli flag was burned in front of a Budapest synagogue, reportedly by members of Jobbik, an ultranationalist Hungarian political party.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7706391", "categories": ["Synagogue buildings with domes", "Moorish Revival synagogues", "Neolog Judaism synagogues", "19th-century synagogues", "Synagogues in Budapest", "Religious buildings and structures completed in 1859", "Landmarks in Hungary", "Erzsébetváros"], "title": "Dohány Street Synagogue"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706424", "text": "Yang Xingmi\n\nYang Xingmi (; 852 – December 24, 905), né Yang Xingmin (楊行愍, name changed 886), courtesy name Huayuan (化源), formally Prince Wuzhong of Wu (吳武忠王, \"martial and faithful\"), later posthumously honored King Xiaowu of Wu (吳孝武王, \"filial and martial\") then Emperor Wu of Wu (吳武帝) with the temple name of Taizu (太祖), was a military governor (\"Jiedushi\") of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) late in the Chinese Tang Dynasty, whose takeover of Huainan and several nearby circuits allowed him and his family to rule over territory that would eventually become the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms state Wu (although Yang Xingmi would be the first ruler in his line to receive the title of Prince of Wu, it was a Tang-bestowed title and did not denote independence of the state), including most of modern Jiangsu and Anhui and parts of modern Jiangxi and Hubei.\n\nYang Xingmin was born in 852, during the reign of Emperor Xuānzong of Tang. He was from Lu Prefecture (廬州, in modern Hefei, Anhui). His ancestors, including his father Yang Fu (楊怤), were farmers for generations. In youth, Tian Jun and he became close friends, and they came to refer to each other as brother. It was said that he was physically strong in his youth, and during the \"Qianfu\" era (874-879) of Emperor Xuānzong's grandson Emperor Xizong, Yang Xingmin became a bandit. He was captured, but the prefect of Lu Prefecture, Zheng Qi, was impressed by his appearance, and stated to him, \"You will be rich and honored one day. Why be a bandit?\" Zheng then released him. Yang later became a soldier of the Lu Prefecture militia, and he distinguished himself in battles. However, as a result, his commander was apprehensive of him, and persuaded then-prefect Lang Youfu (郎幼復) to send Yang on an away mission. When Yang subsequently met his commander to bid farewell, and the commander, wanting to pretend to favor Yang, asked Yang what favors Yang would want him to do, if any; Yang responded, \"I need your head!\" and then killed him. Yang then took control of the militia and declared himself the commander. Lang was unable to control him, and so submitted a report to Gao Pian the military governor (\"Jiedushi\") of Huainan Circuit, which Lu Prefecture belonged to, recommending that Gao commission Yang the new prefect to replace Lang himself. Gao agreed, and Emperor Xizong subsequently, at Gao's recommendation, issued such a commission.\n\nAlso in 883, two of Gao Pian's officers, Yu Gongchu (俞公楚) and Yao Guiili (姚歸禮), failed in an assassination attempt against Gao's favored sorcerer Lü Yongzhi, who had in effect taken over Huainan's governance due to Gao's trust in him. Lü thus made accusations against them, and Gao sent them out to combat agrarian rebels. Lü then secretly informed Yang (falsely) that Yu and Yao's intent was to attack Lu Prefecture. Yang responded by laying an ambush for Yu and Yao, killing them, and then informing Gao that they had planned a mutiny. Gao, not knowing that Lü put this incident into motion, rewarded Yang for putting down the \"mutiny.\"\n\nIn 884, when Gao's nephew Gao Yu (高澞), then the prefect of nearby Shu Prefecture (舒州, in modern Anqing, Anhui), came under the attack of the local agrarian rebel Chen Ru (陳儒), Gao Yu sought aid from Yang. Yang did not have enough soldiers to respond, but sent his officer Li Shenfu, who tricked Chen into believing that a large army was arriving from Lu. As a result, Chen fled. Subsequently, when Qin Zongquan, who was previously the Tang military governor of Fengguo Circuit (奉國, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) but who had rebelled against Tang by this point, sent a brother to attack Lu, Yang sent Tian Jun to repel Qin's attack. Meanwhile, when other agrarian rebels Wu Jiong (吳迥) and Li Ben (李本) attacked Shu, Gao Yu abandoned it (and was subsequently executed by Gao Pian). Yang then sent his officers Tao Ya (陶雅) and Zhang Xun (張訓) to attack Wu and Li; after Tao and Zhang subsequently captured and executed Wu and Li, Yang commissioned Tao as the prefect of Shu.\n\nIn 886 — by which point the prefects of Huainan appeared to be attacking each other at will to enlarge their spheres of influence — Zhang Ao (張翱) the prefect of Shou Prefecture (壽州, in modern Lu'an, Anhui) sent his officer Wei Qian (魏虔) to attack Lu. Yang sent Tian, Li Shenfu, and Zhang Xun to resist, and they repelled Wei's attack. Meanwhile, though, Xu Qing (許勍) the prefect of Chú Prefecture (滁洲, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui) attacked Shu; Tao was unable to resist, and fled back to Lu, allowing Xu to take Shu. Also in 886, under Gao's order, for reasons unclear, Yang changed his name from Xingmin to Xingmi.\n\nIn 887, Gao Pian's officer Bi Shiduo, fearing that Lü Yongzhi would have him killed, rebelled and put Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture (揚州) under siege. Lü, who then had a fallout with Gao himself (as Gao wanted to compromise with Bi while Lü opposed), sent Yang Xingmi an order in Gao's name requesting that he come to Yang Prefecture's aid. Yang, under the advice of his strategist Yuan Xi (袁襲), decided to act. He gathered his own forces and requested additional forces from Sun Duan (孫端) the prefect of neighboring He Prefecture (和州, in modern Chaohu, Anhui), and headed for Yang Prefecture. Before he got there, Lü, with Gao and Gao's nephew Gao Jie (高傑) turning against him, already fled Yang Prefecture, and they rendezvoused at Tianchang (天長, in modern Chuzhou), along with Bi's one-time ally Zhang Shenjian (張神劍), who had turned against Bi due to Bi's refusal to give him the spoils he wanted. (By this point, Bi, who had received aid from Qin Yan the governor of Xuanshe Circuit (宣歙, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), had offered the military governorship to Qin, so he informed Zhang that any division of spoils had to await Qin's decision, drawing Zhang's anger.)\n\nYang Xingmi then took these joint forces and put Yang Prefecture under siege. Qin and Bi initially defended the city against the siege, but their attempts to counterattack were repelled by Yang Xingmi, who inflicted heavy losses on their troops. Meanwhile, under siege, Yang Prefecture was running out of food supplies, leaving to severe famine and cannibalism. (During the siege, Qin put Gao to death, and Yang Xingmi responded by a great display of mourning.) After several months, Yang Xingmi, unable to capture the city, considered withdrawing, but one night, Lü's former subordinate Zhang Shenwei (張審威) opened the city gates and allowed Yang Xingmi's forces in. Qin and Bi fled, allowing Yang Xingmi to capture the city. He claimed the title of acting military governor, while putting Lü and several other officers whose loyalty he considered suspect to death, including Zhang Shenjian.\n\nHowever, by this point, Qin Zongquan's general Sun Ru had arrived in the vicinity, having been sent earlier in the year by Qin Zongquan to vie for control of Huainan Circuit. (When Qin Zongquan subsequently tried to recall Sun, Sun killed Qin Zongquan's brother Qin Zongheng (秦宗衡), who was theoretically the commander of the army, and refused the recall, effectively acting independently from this point on.) Qin Yan and Bi joined forces with Sun, who immediately put up a threatening posture against Yang Xingmi. Yuan believed that with Yang Xingmi's forces worn out by the lengthy siege and the people of Yang Prefecture facing starvation, Yang Xingmi was in no shape to confront Sun. He suggested that Yang Xingmi abandon the city. Yang Xingmi agreed, and he prepared for an evacuation and return to Lu Prefecture, but did not carry it out immediately.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tang imperial government, which was also weary of the developments at Huainan Circuit, had commissioned Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) the military governor of Huainan as well. Zhu announced that he was making Yang Xingmi deputy military governor, while announcing his own officer Li Fan (李璠) as acting military governor. He sent his advisor Zhang Yanfan (張延範) to Yang Prefecture to convey his good will and decisions to Yang Xingmi. Yang Xingmi initially welcomed Zhang, but upon hearing that Zhu was sending Li Fan as acting military governor, turned angry. Zhang, in fear, fled back to Xuanwu. Meanwhile, Li Fan, on his way south, was ambushed by Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua Circuit (感化, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), who was angry that Zhu, not he, was given Huainan. With both Yang Xingmi and Shi turning against him, Zhu abandoned his plans of taking control of Huainan. He subsequently recommended to the imperial government that Yang be made acting military governor. In spring 888, Sun (who by this point had put Qin Yan and Bi to death and taken over their forces) finally attacked Yang Prefecture, capturing it easily. Sun claimed the title of military governor. Yang Xingmi fled, and per Yuan's suggestion, returned to Lu Prefecture to prepare his next step.\n\nYang Xingmi, however, believed that Sun Ru would eventually attack him, and in fall 888, he considered heading south to attack Zhong Chuan the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (鎮南, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) to try to take over Zhong's territory. Yuan Xi, however, pointed out that Zhong had possessed Zhennan for years and was well-prepared for an attack; instead, he suggested that Yang attack Zhao Huang the governor of Xuanshe (who had been commissioned by Qin Yan when Qin left Xuanshe to head for Huainan). Yang agreed, and also persuaded Sun Duan and Zhang Xiong, an independent general who was then at Shangyuan (上元, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), to attack Zhao as well. With Zhao's main forces distracted by Sun's and Zhang's attacks, Yang was able to cross the Yangtze River easily and put Xuanshe's capital Xuan Prefecture (宣州) under siege. When Zhao's brother Zhao Qianzhi (趙乾之) the prefect of Chi Prefecture (池州, in modern Chizhou, Anhui) tried to come to aid Zhao Huang, Yang sent Tao Ya to face him, and Tao defeated him, forcing him to flee to Zhennan. By 889, With Xuan Prefecture running out of food, Zhao Huang's officer Zhou Jinsi (周進思) expelled him; he tried to flee to Yang Prefecture, but Tian Jun captured him. After Yang reported what occurred to Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong, Emperor Zhaozong commissioned Yang as the governor of Xuanshe. Meanwhile, Zhu Quanzhong, who was an old friend of Zhao Huang's, sent emissaries to request that Yang release Zhao to him. However, Yang, accepting Yuan's suggestion that doing so might leave Zhao as a threat, instead executed Zhao and gave Zhao's head to Zhu's emissaries. Meanwhile, he sent Tian to attack Chang Prefecture (常州, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu), then held by Du Leng (杜稜), a subordinate of Qian Liu; Tian surprised Du and captured him, taking Chang Prefecture. Yang also sent Ma Jingyan (馬敬言) to capture Run Prefecture (潤州, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), and Ma did so. Subsequently, Emperor Zhaozong upgraded Xuanshe to a circuit with a military governor, renamed it Ningguo, and made Yang its military governor. Yang then also sent Li You (李友) to capture Sū Prefecture (蘇州, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu), but subsequently, Sun Ru attacked and took Su, killing Li You; Yang's officer An Renyi (安仁義), who was then at Run, then abandoned Run as well, allowing Sun to take Run. When Sun attacked Lu, Cai Chou (蔡儔), whom Yang had left in defense of Lu, also surrendered it to Sun.\n\nIn spring 891, Sun pressed his attack, repeatedly defeating An and Tian, pushing toward Xuan Prefecture. It was said that the morale of Yang's army fell low in light of the defeats, rebounding only somewhat after some successes by Li Shenfu and Tai Meng (臺濛). Sun pushed forward to Huangchi (黃池, in modern Wuhu, Anhui) and defeated Yang's officers Liu Wei (劉威) and Zhu Yanshou (a younger brother of Yang's wife Lady Zhu). However, Sun's army was thereafter stricken by a flood, forcing him to withdraw and return to Yang Prefecture. He nevertheless was able to send his officers Kang Wang (康暀) and An Jingsi (安景思) to capture He and Chú Prefectures, respectively, although Li Shenfu soon recaptured them.\n\nSubsequently, Yang and Zhu Quanzhong entered into an alliance against Sun. When Sun heard this, he decided that he would destroy Yang first and then attack Zhu. He thus forced the mature men and women of Yang Prefecture across the Yangtze to accompany his army, while killing the old and the weak. (As Sun left Yang Prefecture, Yang sent Zhang Xun and Li Decheng into Yang Prefecture to take control of the remaining food supplies in the city and to comfort those who escaped Sun's massacre, effectively allowing him to take the city without a fight.) Sun subsequently surrounded Yang Xingmi at Guangde (廣德, in modern Xuancheng), and Yang Xingmi only escaped through the efforts of his officer Li Jian (李簡). Sun then advanced toward Xuan Prefecture. Yang Xingmi sought aid from Qian, who then possessed the Hang Prefecture (杭州, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang) region; Qian did not launch troops, but did aid Yang's army with food.\n\nIn spring 892, With Sun's numerically superior army pressuring him, Yang considered abandoning Xuan Prefecture and withdrawing to Tongguan (銅官, in modern Tongling, Anhui). Liu, Li Shenfu, and Dai Yougui (戴友規) dissuaded him, pointing out that Sun believed that he could destroy Yang quickly and therefore carried a minimal amount of food, and if Yang could simply refuse to engage Sun and wear Sun's army down, he could be destroyed. Dai further persuaded Yang to send the Yang Prefecture refugees who had fled to Ningguo back to Yang Prefecture to settle down, to try to see if that would cause Sun's army to miss Yang Prefecture. Meanwhile, Zhang and Yang's other officers also retook Chang and Run Prefectures. When Shi Pu also wanted to use this opportunity to advance south, Zhang and Li Decheng repelled his forces and further took Chǔ Prefecture (楚州, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu, note different tone from the prefecture in modern Chuzhou).\n\nBy summer 892, Sun's army had been worn down sufficiently that Yang's army was beginning to have successes, and Zhang cut off Sun's army's food supply routes. Further, Sun's army was suffering from diseases, and Sun himself was stricken with malaria. With food supplies running low, he sent his officers Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin to the nearby countryside to pillage for food. Yang, after hearing that Sun had fallen ill, made a final attack against Sun, defeating him. Tian captured Sun on the battlefield, and Yang executed Sun, sending his head to Emperor Zhaozong. Most of Sun's army surrendered to Yang, although Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin took some of the remnants and advanced south. (They eventually reached the Hunan region and took it over.) Yang then marched victoriously to Yang Prefecture and made it his headquarters again, while stationing Tian at Xuan Prefecture and An Renyi at Run Prefecture. Emperor Zhaozong, receiving Yang's report, made him the military governor of Huainan, while making Tian the acting military governor of Ningguo and An the prefect of Run.\n\nIt was said that due to years of warfare, Huainan Circuit was stripped of its population and wealth. Yang Xingmi was frugal, promoted farming, decreased the tax burden, and encouraged commerce with nearby circuits. It was said that within several years, Huainan was restored to what it was before the war began. He organized 5,000 of Sun Ru's soldiers who submitted to him into an elite corp known as the Heiyun Corps (黑雲都), and had them serve as his advance corps in battles against other circuits.\n\nMeanwhile, although Sun's subordinates largely submitted to Yang (other than the escaped Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin), Cai Chou the prefect of Lu Prefecture, who had previously been Yang's subordinate but had surrendered to Sun, started a campaign to resist Yang at Lu Prefecture, along with Ni Zhang (倪章) the prefect of Shu Prefecture. Cai, in order to show resolve, dug open the graves of Yang's ancestors, and further had an emissary offer his prefect seal to Zhu Quanzhong, seeking aid from Zhu. Zhu, however, despised Cai for his treachery, and refused to aid Cai; instead, he informed Yang of what Cai had done. Yang thanked Zhu and sent Li Shenfu to attack Cai, and commanded a follow-up army himself. Cai's subordinate Zhang Hao surrendered to Yang. Lu Prefecture fell in fall 893, and Yang executed Cai — but refused to accept the suggestion that Cai's ancestral tombs be dug up, stating: \"Because of what Cai Chou did, the people under heaven despised him. Why should I follow his example?\" Thereafter, he also sent Tian Jun to attack She Prefecture (歙州, in modern Huangshan, Anhui); when the people of She offered to surrender if Yang would make Tao Ya, who was known for kindness to the people, prefect, Yang did so, and She surrendered. Yang treated the imperially-commissioned prefect Pei Shu with respect, and sent him back to the imperial government. Meanwhile, Ni abandoned Shu and fled, and Yang sent Li Shenfu to be its prefect.\n\nIn spring 894, Wu Tao (吳討) the prefect of Huang Prefecture (黃州, in modern Wuhan, Hubei) — which belonged to neighboring Wuchang Circuit (武昌, headquartered in modern Wuhan) — submitted to Yang. When Wuchang's military governor Du Hong subsequently attacked Huang, Yang sent Zhu Yanshou to aid Wu Tao, starting years of warfare with Wuchang. (Wu subsequently offered to resign since he feared further attack from Du; Yang then had Ju Zhang (瞿章) take over as prefect.) Meanwhile, the relationship between Yang and Zhu Quanzhong also broke down over two disputes — when an emissary of Zhu's insulted Zhang Jian (張諫) the prefect of Si Prefecture (泗州, in modern Huai'an), Zhang responded by submitting to Yang, and when Yang sent his officer Tang Linghui (唐令回) to Xuanwu's capital Bian Prefecture (汴州) with a large supply of tea to try to sell it for profit, Zhu had Tang detained and seized all of the tea. In spring 895, Yang submitted a petition to Emperor Zhaozong accusing Zhu of crimes, requesting that Emperor Zhaozong order the military governors to the north to attack Zhu with him; Emperor Zhaozong's court, which was extremely weak by that point, was not recorded as having taken any actions on Yang's petition. Yang subsequently attacked Shou Prefecture and captured it; he made Zhu Yanshou its military prefect (團練使, \"Tuanlianshi\"), and Zhu Yanshou was subsequently able to beat back a Xuanwu counterattack and able to hold Shou.\n\nMeanwhile, Dong Chang the military governor of Yisheng Circuit (義勝, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) had misjudged his strength and declared himself the emperor of a new state of Luoping (羅平). Qian Liu (who carried the title of military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, previously headquartered at Run Prefecture but now was headquartered at Qian's base Hang Prefecture)), who had previously been Dong's subordinate, used this as the excuse to attack Dong, seeking to conquer Dong's Yisheng Circuit. Yang, not wanting to see Qian conquer Dong, tried to dissuade Qian, and also sent emissaries to Dong urging him to immediately cancel any use of imperial title and resume offering tributes to Emperor Zhaozong. Qian would not relent in his attack, however, so Yang sent Tai Meng to attack Sū Prefecture to divert Qian's attention, while submitting petitions in Dong's defense. However, while Yang, who later went to Su himself to command the siege, was able to capture Su, additional attacks by Tian and An Renyi against other officers of Qian's were repelled, and Qian's attacks against Dong did not abate. By summer 896, Dong was forced to surrender to Qian, who executed him and took over Yisheng (which was subsequently renamed Zhendong). Meanwhile, Qian, Du Hong, and Zhong Chuan, all fearing that they would be the next target of Yang's expansion, entered into an alliance with Zhu Quanzhong. Around this time, Emperor Zhaozong also gave Yang the honorary titles of acting \"Taifu\" (太傅) and \"Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi\" (同中書門下平章事) and created him the Prince of Hongnong.\n\nBy spring 897, Zhu Quanzhong had achieved final victory against two military governors that he had waged war for years — Zhu Xuan the military governor of Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and Zhu Xuan's cousin Zhu Jin the military governor of Taining Circuit (泰寧, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) — capturing and executing Zhu Xuan, forcing Zhu Jin to flee, and taking control of both circuits, allowing him full control of the region between the Yellow River and the Huai River. (Shi Pu's Ganhua Circuit had fallen to him in 893.) Zhu Jin fled to Huainan, along with the Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) officers Shi Yan (史儼) and Li Chengsi (李承嗣), whom Hedong's military governor Li Keyong had previously sent to aid Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin. Yang personally went to Gaoyou (高郵, in modern Yangzhou) to welcome them. It was said that previously, the Huainan forces were only capable at water welfare, and now with the injection of the field soldiers from Tianping, Taining, and Hedong, their field fighting capabilities were greatly improved. Li Keyong subsequently sent emissaries to Yang, requesting that Shi and Li Chengsi be returned to him; Yang agreed, but as Yang treated Shi and Li Chengsi well and awarded them with much treasure, neither Shi nor Li Chengsi actually ever returned to Hedong, and they served Huainan thereafter.\n\nLater in spring 897, Yang resumed his attacks against Wuchang. At Du's request for assistance, Zhu Quanzhong sent his adoptive son Zhu Yougong (朱友恭) to attack Huang Prefecture. Ju Zhang abandoned Huang in response to Zhu Yougong's attack, but was subsequently captured by Zhu Yougong. Meanwhile, Zhu Quanzhong, having conquered Tianping and Taining, decided to make Huainan his next target, so he gathered his available forces and sent his major general Pang Shigu (龐師古) with 70,000 soldiers from Xuanwu and Ganhua Circuits to Qingkou (清口, in modern Huai'an), posturing to head to Yang Prefecture; another major general Ge Congzhou with the forces from Tianping and Taining Circuits to Anfeng (安豐, in modern Lu'an), posturing to head to Shou Prefecture; and Zhu Quanzhong himself with his main forces to Sù Prefecture (宿州, in modern Suzhou, Anhui, note different tone from the prefecture in modern Jiangsu). The people of Huainan Circuit was greatly shocked and dismayed by Zhu's forces. However, Pang, because he had such an impressive force, underestimated Yang Xingmi's army. Yang Xingmi had Zhu Jin serve as his advance commander, and Zhu constructed a dam on the Huai River. When Yang Xingmi attacked Pang, Zhu released the waters to flood Pang's army, and then attacked Pang with Yang. Pang's army was crushed by the waters and the Huainan forces, and Pang was killed. Zhu Yanshou also defeated Ge's army. Hearing that both of his generals had been defeated, Zhu Quanzhong also retreated. This battle thus affirmed Yang's control of the territory between the Huai and the Yangtze Rivers.\n\nIn spring 898, Qian Liu, Zhong Chuan, Du Hong, and Wang Shifan, the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), all submitted petitions to Emperor Zhaozong, requesting that the imperial government declare a general campaign against Yang, with Zhu Quanzhong as the campaign commander; Emperor Zhaozong refused. Meanwhile, hearing of Zhu Quanzhong's defeat, Zhao Kuangning the military governor of Zhongyi Circuit (忠義, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) secretly entered into an alliance with Yang, but after Zhu Quanzhong found out and attacked Zhongyi, capturing Zhao's brother Zhao Kuanglin (趙匡璘), Zhao Kuangning agreed to abandon his alliance with Yang. Similarly, Cui Hong (崔洪) the military governor of Fengguo Circuit, a vassal of Zhu's, also had secret communications with Yang, and when Zhu discovered this, Zhu sent Zhang Cunjing (張存敬) to attack Cui. Cui warded off the attack by sending his brother Cui Xian (崔賢) to Zhu as a hostage and promised to contribute 2,000 soldiers to Zhu's campaigns. (Subsequently, when Zhu sent Cui Xian back to Fengguo and demanded that he return with the 2,000 promised soldiers, Cui Hong's officer Cui Jingsi (崔景思) assassinated Cui Xian and seized Cui Hong, fleeing to Yang's domain with him and the soldiers.)\n\nIn spring 899, Yang Xingmi and Zhu Jin attacked Ganhua's capital Xu Prefecture (徐州). Zhu Quanzhong, after first sending his officer Zhang Guihou (張歸厚) to try to relieve Xu, also personally led a relief force that trailed. When Yang heard of Zhu's impending arrival, he withdrew.\n\nIn 900, Emperor Zhaozong bestowed on Yang the honorary chancellor title of \"Shizhong\" (侍中).\n\nIn fall 901, rumors arrived at Yang's headquarters that Qian Liu had been assassinated. Believing the rumors to be true and believing that this would be his opportunity to seize Qian's capital Hang Prefecture, he sent Li Shenfu to attack Qian's Zhenhai Circuit. Qian sent his general Gu Quanwu (顧全武) to resist, but Li Shenfu defeated and captured him. However, Li soon realized that Qian had not been assassinated and that he would not be able to capture more of Qian's territory. To ward off a Qian counterattack, he, who had captured Qian's hometown Lin'an (臨安, in modern Hangzhou) by this point, protected Qian's ancestral tombs and allowed Gu, whom Qian valued greatly, to write home; he also pretended a large Huainan reinforcement was on the way. After extracting a large amount of monetary award from Qian, he then withdrew. (Yang later returned Gu to Zhenhai in return for Qin Pei (秦裴), a Huainan officer who was captured when Qian recaptured Sū Prefecture.)\n\nBy late 901, the powerful palace eunuchs, upon learning of a plot between Emperor Zhaozong and the chancellor Cui Yin to slaughter them, planned to kill Cui. In response, Cui summoned Zhu Quanzhong to the imperial capital Chang'an with an army. Upon hearing of Zhu's impending arrival, the eunuchs, led by Han Quanhui, seized Emperor Zhaozong and fled to the domain of Han's ally Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). Zhu soon arrived in Chang'an's vicinity and, at Cui's urging, put Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege. With Fengxiang under siege, Emperor Zhaozong issued an edict (possibly under the eunuchs' duress) in spring 902 to Yang, commissioning him as the overall commander of the circuits to the east, bestowing him the honorary chancellor title of \"Zhongshu Ling\" (中書令), and created him the Prince of Wu. The edict ordered Yang to attack Zhu from the east. (The edict was delivered by Li Yan, the son of the retired chancellor Zhang Jun, on whom Emperor Zhaozong bestowed the imperial surname of Li. Li Yan would subsequently remain in Yang's domain to serve as the Tang emperor's representative, although after Li Yan's arrival Yang also himself began exercising imperial authority, as the edict that Li Yan delivered authorized him to do so.) Yang thereafter prepared a campaign against Zhu.\n\nWhile Yang was preparing the campaign against Zhu, Tian Jun, who was by this point the military governor of Ningguo, was preparing an attack against Feng Hongduo, an officer of Zhang Xiong's who had continued to occupy Sheng Prefecture (昇州, i.e., Shangyuan) after Zhang's death, who had an impressive fleet. (Because of his fleet, Feng had refused to submit to Yang.) Tian built a fleet himself in preparation, and Feng decided to preempt him by attacking Ningguo's capital Xuan Prefecture with his fleet, despite Yang's sending messengers to urge him not to. When Feng engaged Tian, however, Tian defeated him and crushed his fleet. Feng, in light of his defeat, considered heading east out onto the East China Sea, but Yang persuaded him that he would be treated well if he submitted to Yang. Feng did so, and Yang commissioned him as deputy military governor of Huainan. Yang then sent Li Shenfu to serve as the prefect of Sheng.\n\nWith the Feng threat over, Yang launched his attack on Zhu's domain, leaving Li Chengsi in charge at Huainan's headquarters. However, his army ran into food supply problems, as the large ships that he used to ship food supplies got stuck in the canals. (Xu Wen had suggested supplying the army with small ships instead, to no avail, but after this incident Yang began to value Xu's advice and began to promote him.) Subsequently, when the Huainan army attacked but could not capture Sù Prefecture quickly, Yang withdrew. (With Yang's campaign having failed, by 903 Li Maozhen was forced to kill Han and other eunuchs who followed Han and surrender Emperor Zhaozong to Zhu, to sue for peace. Zhu subsequently slaughtered the remaining eunuchs and took Emperor Zhaozong back to Chang'an and kept him under effective control.)\n\nIn fall 902, Qian's officers Xu Wan and Xu Zaisi (許再思) mutinied against him and tried to take Hang Prefecture for themselves. When their initial attempt failed, they enticed Tian from coming to their aid. When Tian arrived at Hang Prefecture, he put it under siege and offered that if Qian would surrender it, he would be allowed to withdraw to Zhendong Circuit without further pursuit from Tian. Qian refused and, under Gu's suggestion, decided to enlist Yang's aid in stopping Tian (who was still Yang's vassal at this point). He sent Gu, with his son Qian Chuanliao (錢傳璙), to Huainan as emissaries. Gu pointed out to Yang that if Tian captured Zhenhai, his power would increase greatly and would threaten Yang's; instead, he offered that if Yang would order Tian to withdraw, Qian Liu would leave Qian Chuanliao as a hostage. Yang accepted the proposal and gave a daughter to Qian Chuanliao in marriage. Yang subsequently ordered Tian to withdraw, threatening that if he did not, Yang would send someone else to take over Ningguo. Faced with the threat, Tian withdrew after extracting a monetary payment from Qian and forcing Qian to surrender a son (Qian Chuanguan) as hostage.\n\nIn spring 903, Yang sent Li Shenfu, assisted by Liu You (劉有), to attack Du Hong's Wuchang Circuit. Meanwhile, Wang Shifan, who had similarly received an edict from Emperor Zhaozong to attack Zhu during the Fengxiang siege and who had acted on it, was now facing the overwhelming attack of Zhu's, and he sought aid from Yang. Yang sent Wang Maozhang to aid him and launched an attack on Sù Prefecture, but soon withdrew his attack from Sù. In addition, while Wang Maozhang initially had successes in conjunction with Wang Shifan in repelling the Xuanwu attack, soon, Wang Maozhang, determining that it would be impossible to indefinitely hold off the Xuanwu attack, withdrew from Pinglu, leaving Wang Shifan without further aid. By winter 903, Wang Shifan was forced to resubmit to Zhu.\n\nMeanwhile, it was said that Tian had become deeply resentful against Yang for forcing him to abandon Zhenhai. His resentment was furthered when he went to Yang Prefecture to meet Yang Xingmi to request that Chi and She Prefecture, both of which had previously belonged to Ningguo, be returned to Ningguo, and Yang refused. In summer 903, Tian and An Renyi (who was then still at Run Prefecture as its military prefect) together rose in rebellion against Yang; they eventually enticed Zhu Yanshou, who was then at Shou Prefecture and who carried the title of military governor of Fengguo, to join them as well (although Zhu Yanshou did not initially publicly state his intentions), and sent emissaries to Zhu Quanzhong, who also postured to attack Huainan to aid them. In face of the threat, Yang recalled Li Shenfu (who had been attacking Wuchang) to attack Tian and sent Wang Maozhang and Xu Wen to attack An. Yang, realizing that Zhu Yanshou was about to turn against him, pretended to have suffered a stroke and stated to his wife Lady Zhu that he would be entrusting the headquarters to Zhu Yanshou; she wrote Zhu Yanshou relaying Yang's remarks. Yang then summoned Zhu Yanshou to Yang Prefecture; believing Yang's sincerity, Zhu Yanshou went and was seized and executed by Yang, who then also executed Zhu Yanshou's brothers and divorced Lady Zhu.\n\nMeanwhile, Li Shenfu had initial successes against Tian's officers Wang Tan (王壇) and Wang Jian (汪建). Tian therefore decided to depart Xuan Prefecture and engage Li Shenfu himself. At Li Shenfu's suggestion, Yang then sent Tai Meng to attack Xuan after Tian left Xuan. Upon hearing that Tai was about to arrive, Tian turned back to Xuan and engaged Tai. Tai sent letters in Yang's name to Tian's officers, who still bore allegiance to Yang, and then attacked, defeating Tian, who then fled back to Xuan Prefecture. Tai put Xuan under siege, and when Tian tried to counterattack, Tai defeated him and killed him. Yang, remembering his friendship with Tian, pardoned Tian's mother Lady Yin and continued to honor her as she was a mother. Further, he incorporated Tian's staff into his despite their earlier opposition to him. (An continued to hold out and would not be defeated and executed until spring 905.)\n\nWith Tian defeated, Yang commissioned Li Shenfu as the new military governor of Ningguo, but Li Shenfu declined and resumed the campaign against Wuchang. (Instead, Yang commissioned Tai as governor (not military governor).) Yang also sent Gu and Qian Chuanliao, along with Qian Chuanliao's wife (his daughter) back to Qian Liu. Meanwhile, Zhu Quanzhong had destroyed the city of Chang'an and forced Emperor Zhaozong to move the capital to Luoyang. On the journey to Luoyang, Emperor Zhaozong sent one final secret communique to Yang, Li Keyong, and Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) to ask for them to make an attempt to rescue him; none of the three did. Still, when Zhu Quanzhong sent emissaries to try to persuade Yang to abandon the campaign against Wuchang, Yang sent back the response, \"I will do so and rebuild my relationship with you if the Son of Heaven were restored to Chang'an.\"\n\nIn summer 904, Li Shenfu fell ill and died while attacking Wuchang; Yang replaced him with Liu Cun (劉存). Meanwhile, Tai also died, and Yang replaced Tai with his oldest son Yang Wo.\n\nIn winter 904, Zhu Quanzhong himself led an army to try to aid Wuchang and sent other officers to raid Huainan territory. He also sent Cao Yanzuo (曹延祚) to Wuchang's capital E Prefecture (鄂州) to help Du defend it in light of Liu's siege. However, by spring 905, Liu had captured E Prefecture and taken Du and Cao prisoner; he sent them to Yang Prefecture, where they were executed, allowing Yang to incorporate Wuchang into his domain.\n\nThrough the years, Zhao Kuangning remained in communications with both Yang and Wang Jian, a situation that eventually drew Zhu's anger. In summer 905, he launched a major attack against both Zhao Kuangning and his brother Zhao Kuangming, the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). The Zhao brothers were crushed; Zhao Kuangning fled to Huainan, and Zhao Kuangming fled to Xichuan. Zhu incorporated their domains into his. After his success, he decided to head east to attack Huainan, but after running into storms, withdrew.\n\nMeanwhile, Yang grew ill, and faced a succession problem. The natural successor would be his son Yang Wo, but the Huainan staff members all had low opinions of Yang Wo. When Yang Xingmi brought up the matter with his secretary Zhou Yin (周隱) and told Zhou to issue an order summoning Yang Wo back from Xuan Prefecture, Zhou opposed the idea, stating that he viewed Yang Wo as an inappropriate successor due to his love for drinking and games. Instead, Zhou suggested that Yang entrust the circuit to Liu Wei with the direction that after Yang's younger sons grew older that the circuit be given to one of them — a proposal that Xu Wen and Zhang Hao attacked as unworkable. When Yang again told Zhou to summon Yang Wo, Zhou drafted such an order but then delayed sending it. However, Xu and Zhang found the order and sent it, and Yang Wo arrived in Yang Prefecture in winter 905. Yang Xingmi commissioned him as the acting military governor of Huainan and soon thereafter died. At the Huainan staff members' request, Li Yan issued an order under Tang imperial authority making Yang Wo the new military governor of Huainan and overall commander of the eastern circuits, succeeding Yang Xingmi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7706424", "categories": ["Politicians from Hefei", "10th-century Chinese monarchs", "Tang dynasty politicians from Anhui", "Tang dynasty jiedushi of Huainan Circuit", "Tang dynasty nonimperial princes", "Tang dynasty jiedushi of Ningguo Circuit", "905 deaths", "852 births"], "title": "Yang Xingmi"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706448", "text": "The Rave-Ups\n\nThe Rave-Ups are an American rock group founded in 1979 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania who gained greater attention after relocating to Los Angeles, California.\n\nThey are best known for their alternative rock hit songs \"Respectfully King of Rain\" and \"Positively Lost Me\" as well as their appearances in \"Pretty in Pink\" and \"Beverly Hills, 90210\".\n\nThe group's music has been diverse, touching on singer-songwriter, pop-rock, power-pop, roots rock, alternative rock, and alt-country, at well before the alt-country movement. Critic Ira Robbins described the Rave-Ups as having been \"touted as the next big thing to erupt from the LA club scene\" of the 1980s, but also dogged by legal and personal problems that hampered the band's success.\n\nThe Rave-Ups were founded at Carnegie Mellon University in the fall of 1979 by Jimmer Podrasky (guitar/vocals), with Michael Kaniecki (guitar/vocals), George Carter (bass, violin, vocals), and T.J. Junco (drums). The original group lasted only through that fall when T.J. Junco left the band. Richard Slevin (drums) joined the group in January 1980 and helped the band develop through the year, and though the group was considered part of Pittsburgh's early punk/new wave scene, along with its sister group The Shakes/Combo Tactic. With a somewhat more polished style than many of their peers, The Rave-Ups were considered less an example of the Punk genre and more of a musical stew of punk, pop, country, blues and folk. The band performed mostly original songs written by Podrasky and Kaniecki, with some songs contributed by Carter, and a few covers. Early performances in Pittsburgh were at The Electric Banana, The Decade Lounge, functions at Carnegie Mellon, as well as regular gigs at Fat City in Swissvale.\n\nDuring the summer of 1980 the band made 4-track and 16-track studio recordings, including the later popular \"Class Tramp\" and \"In My Gremlin,\" along with the usual live recordings of club dates. Slevin left the band in the summer of 1980 to return to his native New York City and was replaced by Victor McPoland, a fellow Pittsburgher and Carnegie/Mellon grad. Meanwhile, the band left Pittsburgh and relocated briefly to Los Angeles, California. Appearing as the \"band\" in a John Wells (later of E.R. and The West Wing fame) production of Sam Shephard's \"The Tooth of Crime,\" the group spent eight weeks in the sun of Los Angeles before returning home to Pittsburgh. A later return to LA by the band didn't gel and the original members broke up soon afterward. Podrasky returned briefly to Pittsburgh, but eventually booked a flight back to Los Angeles in order to further the musical agenda already established by the Pittsburgh group.\n\nThe second incarnation of the band followed after Podrasky met drummer Tim Jimenez in the San Fernando Valley in 1982. Podrasky and Jimenez quickly became close friends and enlisted a bass player, Colleen Campbell, to join the band. Danny Zippi, already established as an actor, joined the group soon after and the band gigged around Los Angeles, almost always for free. Within the year, Campbell and Zippi were replaced by guitarist Chuck Wada & bassist Douglas Leonard. That line-up signed an indie deal and released a six-song EP entitled \"Class Tramp\" on Fun Stuff Records in 1983. The EP sold all 3,000 copies produced. But the Podrasky-Jimenez-Wada-Leonard line-up didn't last long. Late in 1984, Terry Wilson (guitar) and Tommy Blatnik (bass guitar) joined the band on a permanent basis. Ironically, all four members of the band now worked in the mailroom/shipping department of A&M Records, and it was in the basement of the A&M lot that the band rehearsed nightly, honing their craft amongst stacks of posters, album flats and music merchandising. In 1985, the band released their first full-length album, \"Town + Country\", which was met with widespread critical acclaim and sold more than 40,000 copies. The album's only single, \"Positively Lost Me,\" became a college radio hit and cemented the band as thoughtful alt-rockers with an extremely accessible sound, smart songs, and a considerable fondness for country, blues and folk.\n\nActress Molly Ringwald, who had become a friend and fan of the band through her sister Beth's relationship with Podrasky, introduced the band to moviegoers in the John Hughes' classic Sixteen Candles when her character's three-ring binder featured the name \"The Rave-Ups\" scratched on it with a ball point pen. Ringwald later invited director John Hughes to see the band at a club date where the band informally and successfully auditioned for an appearance in the movie \"Pretty in Pink\". In the movie, the Rave-Ups play their song \"Rave-Up, Shut-Up\" on stage while Duckie (Jon Cryer) talks with Iona (Annie Potts) at a nearby table, just before Andie (Ringwald) and Blane (Andrew McCarthy) join them. The next song played by the Rave-Ups in this scene is \"Positively Lost Me.\" The band also appeared on the MTV \"Pretty In Pink\" Movie Premier Special performing \"Positively Lost Me\". That song became a cult hit big enough that Rhino Records included the song on Rhino's \"\". During this time the band was getting major acclaim from critics including Robert Christgau, Robert Hilburn, J.D. Considine, Todd Everett and Roy Trakin and entered into talks with several major record labels.\n\nDuring their still-evolving musical peak, the band was locked in legal battles, all in the hope of moving on to a major label; from 1986 to 1987, little music was released, with the exception of a 12-inch single, \"These Wishes\" (later covered by Pittsburgh band, The Clarks). The poignant ballad \"Big Wide River\" was the B-side of the single, which was produced by Los Lobos' Steve Berlin and engineer Mark Linnett. The band recorded a full-length album with Berlin and Linnett producing, but the record was never released.\n\nIn 1987, the band signed to Epic Records and released their major label debut \"The Book of Your Regrets\" to high critical expectations, despite being only promoted to the college radio scene (albeit a burgeoning one). The album failed to sell many copies, due to Epic's corporate restructuring with Sony and lack of promotion. The label almost dropped the band but a few believers from Epic insisted that the band get another opportunity. That same year, their song \"Class Tramp\" appeared in the cult horror anthology film \"From a Whisper to a Scream\".\n\n1990 saw the release of the album \"Chance\" (named after Podrasky's son with Beth Ringwald) to slightly more commercial success. The single \"Respectfully King of Rain\" became a modest alternative rock hit, garnering some video airplay on MTV and peaking at No. 12 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The second single, a radio-friendly pop anthem called \"(She Says) Come Around\" was readied for distribution (including a music video) by Epic who then decided that they would not promote the single or video and, soon after, dropped the band from the label. The band continued working for a few months, including an appearance on an episode of \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" (\"Spring Dance\") and an opening slot on the Indigo Girls tour. Podrasky soon found himself in a brief relationship/engagement with 90210s star, Shannon Doherty; however, Podrasky's single-father status (he and Ringwald had split-up many months earlier) didn't gel with a Hollywood lifestyle and the relationship soon ended. Within months, after much frustration, The Rave-Ups unofficially broke up in 1992.\n\nIn 1996-1997, Podrasky briefly formed the band The Lovin' Miserys with Concrete Blonde drummer Harry Rushakoff and bass player Sam Bowles from Agent Orange; but the band never released an album and never toured. In 2000, members of The Rave-Ups (Podrasky and Wilson) reformed, recording a CD entitled \"The Salmon in the Woods\" which has remained unreleased as of 2012.\n\nOver the years, Wilson has played on stage and in studio with many bands including the Springfield, Missouri all-star band, The Dog People and spending some time with The Ozark Mountain Devils. Jimenez continues to play with and produce various bands in Los Angeles. Blatnik has also spent time playing with The Dancing Hoods (whose guitarist Mark Linkous later formed Sparklehorse) and The Lonesome Strangers (featuring singer/songwriters Randy Weeks & Jeff Rymes).\n\nPodrasky and Wilson continued to maintain a musical partnership, writing and performing occasionally over the following years. In August 2007, with Jimenez and Blatnik back in the rhythm section, the band re-grouped to play some shows in the Los Angeles area. Since then, they've occasionally performed in southern California, but have yet to release any brand new material. Rumors of a new Rave-Ups record continue to tease diehard fans of the band.\n\nJimmer Podrasky recorded his first solo album with drummer/producer Mitch Marine, guitarist/songwriter Brian Whelan and bassist/songwriter Ted Russell Kamp; the album is \"\"The Would-Be Plans\"\" and was released through JimmerMusic.com in September 2013. According to an interview with MSN Music, Podrasky had intended the album to be a Rave-Ups reunion but couldn't get the other band members on board. Though he had the right to release it as a Rave-Ups record, he felt it wouldn't be right, so it's his first official solo album.\nPodrasky has since recorded his second solo album and is working on its completion and release.\n\nIn late 2015, The Rave-Ups approached Omnivore Recordings about re-releasing the \"\"Town + Country\"\" album as part of the 30th anniversary of the initial Fun Stuff Records release. On July 8, 2016, the re-release became a reality. This reissue of \"\"Town + Country\"\" features the original 10 songs, plus a whopping 11 previously unissued bonus tracks — including live radio performances recorded for Dierdre O'Donoghue's influential \"SNAP\" program on Los Angeles’ legendary KCRW-FM, as well as 1986 material produced by Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) and Mark Linett. A detailed historical essay from the band's Jimmer Podrasky, complemented by numerous unseen photos from the sessions/era, make this not only a document of time + place, but one that helps document a moment in musical history. Mastering and restoration was overseen by Grammy® winner Gavin Lurssen.\n\nAccording to Podrasky from the liners: “Music has the uncanny ability to thwart time and space. It informs a moment. It indexes lives. It creates strange bedfellows. It outlasts people — even the people who helped make the music. Music resonates more than any other art form — that is its unique power. It remains with us long after the last note has faded. \"\"Town + Country\"\" was the beginning of a lifelong journey for me — the start of a trip that still hasn’t ended. I’m proud and honored to have been a part of something that has withstood the test of time.”\n\n\"Town + Country\" is available at Rhapsody, iTunes and Amazon.\n\nJimmer Podrasky is a first cousin of the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, John Roberts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7706448", "categories": ["Epic Records artists", "Musical groups from Pittsburgh", "Cowpunk musical groups", "Alternative rock groups from Pennsylvania"], "title": "The Rave-Ups"}

After failed attempts to escape her fate, to be buried alive wrapped in a black veil, Fausta returns to Rome to accept her punishment.

It serves as a theological consultant to the General Conference. It consists of four Adventist theologians working at the church headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, and is currently (as of 2016) directed by Elias Brasil de Souza. The institute also directs the Biblical Research Institute Committee (BRICOM) which consists of about forty members worldwide, and the Biblical Research Institute Science Council (BRISCO), which investigates the relationship between science and religion.\n\nWoodrow Whidden has described the work of the Institute as \"conservative Adventist scholarship\".\n\nThe Biblical Research Institute was established as a service department of the church on September 25, 1975 by the General Conference. However it has historical roots in a number of other organizations.\n\nIn 1943 church leaders established a committee to give defenses to critics of the church, including offshoot groups. This was named the Defense Literature Committee in 1952, and reorganized as the Biblical Study and Research Group in 1956.\n\nThe Biblical Study and Research Committee or Biblical Study Committee had been created on September 24, 1952. To a certain extent it took the place of the Biblical Research Fellowship, which was being dissolved at the time. The Bible Research Fellowship was an unofficial society of Adventist Bible teachers. It was planned in 1940, and was materialized in 1943. L. L. Caviness was the chairman and Raymond Cottrell its secretary throughout its lifetime of around 10 years. Both were religion lecturers at Pacific Union College at the time. Membership rose to 250, and included all except one Adventist college-level Bible teachers worldwide. Many others were paying members, including some General Conference employees. More than 90 formal papers were presented. In 1950 General Conference president W. H. Branson wrote letters to church leaders worldwide claiming the fellowship was a \"renegade organization\", signaling its demise.\n\nAs mentioned above the Biblical Research Institute was established in 1975. It has sponsored events such as seminars and Bible conferences. From 1982 to 1992 it published the Daniel and Revelation Series in response to the controversy surrounding Desmond Ford.\n\nDirectors:\n\nAs of 2016, the members are Elias Brasil de Souza (director), and Kwabena Donkor, Ekkehard Mueller, and Clinton Wahlen (associate directors). Retired director Ángel M. Rodríguez works as a part-time associate director.\n\nThe Biblical Research Institute Committee examines theological issues that the Seventh-day Adventist Church faces. Its members are elected at General Conference Sessions. BRICOM members for the 2000-2005 quinquennium included: Niels-Erik Andreasen, John T. Baldwin, Matthew A. Bediako, Ivan T. Blazen, Keith Burton, Lael O. Caesar, Jaime Castrejon, Gordon E. Christo, JoAnn M. Davidson, Richard M. Davidson, Ganoune Diop, Ron du Preez, Larry R.

Also known as Christian Brothers' College, Yarraville, or more simply CBC Yarraville, the school for boys opened in 1942, closed in 1972, and was operated by the Congregation of Christian Brothers.\n\nThe school owes its early beginnings to the opening of St. Augustine's primary school in 1895. This early school was operated by the Sisters of St. Joseph, who, guided by the charism of Mary Mackillop, wished to help the poor of the area. At that time the wooden church building served a dual purpose as a school on weekdays, for nearly 200 pupils, and a place of worship on Sundays. In 1896 the school was led by Sister Casimir and the nuns and their assistants taught mixed classes of boys and girls and it was not until much later that classes were strictly segregated.\n\nBy 1930 around 900 students were being taught in the Parish school and the need to build more classrooms was increasing. In 1941 a separate girls school was opened within the parish complex and the need to cater for the boys became obvious.\n\nThe Christian Brothers arrived in 1942 to take charge of the classes for boys. They adopted a modified version of the existing Congregational crest used by the Brothers to identify themselves.\n\nIn 1946 the school enrolment stood at 240 boys in Grades 5 to 8, also known as Proficiency. The following year the school added a First Year Intermediate class to its curriculum. The names of some of the early headmasters include Br. H. Boylan, Br. E. S. Crowle (1946–1952) and Br. R. McCartney. A new residence was opened for the Brothers on Somerville Road in March 1949 but up until that time they travelled daily from the Brothers community at St. Joseph's North Melbourne by train to the Yarraville railway station.\n\nThe Christian Brothers' college closed in 1972, later to be reopened as an extension of St. Augustines Primary school. Following the withdrawal of the Brothers, the Avoca Street Campus was taken over by the Sisters of St Joseph who proceeded to operate the site as an extension of their Altona West school, Mount St. Joseph Girls' College. The handball courts and the ground floor class rooms of the other site were incorporated into the St Augustine's Primary School which had continued its operation on an adjoining site while the upstairs classrooms were incorporated into Mount St Joseph's campus.\n\nFollowing a review by the Sisters of St Joseph in 1975 it was decided that the campus was superfluous to their needs and this led to the opening of Yarraville Catholic Girls College.\n\nThe school was particularly recognised in the city of Melbourne for the strength of its sporting teams, and the sportsmen it produced. For example, six members of the 1954 VFL premiership team (the Footscray Bulldogs) were old boys of St. Augustine's, including Doug Reynolds and Ted Whitten.\n\n\n", "id": "7706514", "categories": ["Congregation of Christian Brothers secondary schools", "Educational institutions disestablished in 1972", "Educational institutions established in 1942", "Defunct Catholic schools in Australia", "1942 establishments in Australia"], "title": "St. Augustine's College, Yarraville"}

Some, such as \"Willie and Laura Mae Jones\", recorded with Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin, had been previously released as singles in the US. \"See All Her Faces\" collects many of those tracks, recorded from 1969 to 1971, placing seven of the British recordings on Side A, while Side B comprises tracks recorded both in the UK and the US.

The male has a red rump, dark bars on the whitish flank and a scarlet eyebrow stripe. The female is duller and smaller than male; it also lacks the male's red eyebrow.\n\nThe orange-breasted waxbill is found in grassland and savannahs south of the Sahara in Africa. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km. This species is also introduced to other countries, e.g., Kuwait. Its diet consists mainly of seeds, insects and shoots. The female usually lays between four and six eggs in an oval-shaped nest made from grass. These nests are often the old nests of red-collared widowbirds.\n\nWidespread and common throughout its large range, the orange-breasted waxbill is evaluated to be of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix III of CITES in Ghana.\n\nOrigin and phylogeny has been obtained by Antonio Arnaiz-Villena et al. Estrildinae may have originated in India and dispersed thereafter (towards Africa and Pacific Ocean habitats).\n\n", "id": "7706597", "categories": ["Birds of East Africa", "Amandava", "Birds of the Middle East", "Birds of Sub-Saharan Africa"], "title": "Orange-breasted waxbill"}

It is typically found at elevations of in the Chihuahuan Desert and south into central Mexico, where it favors rocky habitats, occurring along roadsides as well.\n\nIt is a perennial whose erect stems are somewhat woody at the base, and may reach in height. The leaves resemble those of the closely related \"Eschscholzia\", being finely divided into many gray-green linear lobes. The flowers are solitary yellow cups formed from four overlapping petals, 5–7 cm across, vaguely resembling the unrelated tulip; the two sepals underneath typically fall away as the flower opens. The numerous stamens are short, with orange anthers. The long thin fruits are also reminiscent of \"Eschscholzia\".\n\nThe genus is named for English botanist and collector John Hunnemann (1760-1839). The Latin \"fumariifolia\" literally means \"with leaves like \"Fumaria\"\" (fumitory).\n\nIt is widely cultivated, usually as an annual from seed.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706771", "text": "Small unit tactics\n\nSmall unit tactics is the application of army military doctrine for the combat deployment of platoons and smaller units in a particular strategic and logistic environment. \nThe composition of a United States Army squad falls into three broad categories: classical, balanced and combined.\n\nUnited States Army 'classical' squads are composed of three elements; a command and support element, a base of fire element, and a maneuver element. The command and support element could include a squad leader, an assistant squad leader, a medic, a forward observer and a radio operator or it could be limited to a squad leader. The fire element consists of a machine gunner and one or two personnel who act as loaders and barrel changers for the gun and porters for its ammunition and ancillary components. The maneuver element is composed of troops armed with assault rifles, entrenching tools, grenades and additional ammunition for the machine gun and tasked with the role of enabling the safe movement of the fire element by scouting ahead and providing a security detail.\n\nBalanced squads are composed of two or three fire teams coupled with a command and support element. The fire teams could either be standard base of fire elements organized around a machine gun and protected by assault rifle or submachine gun wielding ammunition porters or the fire teams could be organized as 'storm' units composed of a handful of personnel armed with assault rifles reinforced with a squad automatic weapon and grenade launchers.\n\nThe combined squad is composed of dissimilar fire teams; an RPG team, a fire team and a sniper team. The RPG team consists of two personnel; one armed with an RPG launcher and the other porting extra RPGs and providing protection with an assault rifle. The fire team is composed of two personnel; one carrying a machine gun and the other porting its ammunition. The sniper team consists of one or two persons, one deploying the weapon, often a semi-automatic designated marksman rifle as opposed to a true sniper rifle, and the other acting as spotter and providing close protection.\n\nThe two major techniques of squad assault are bounded fire and advancing under the cover of suppressive fire of supporting units. Bounded fire entails having one element of the squad provide covering fire and field obscuration while the second element maneuvers forward to provide covering fire that allows the first element to leapfrog forward. This process is repeated until the maneuver element is in grenade range of the enemy positions. Advancing under the cover of supporting units requires the squad to stealthily advance towards the enemy position from a weakly held sector after the enemy has been suppressed by overwhelming fire. Once the squad has closed with the enemy it uses grenades and squad automatic fire to engage the enemy. This allows sufficient disruption of the enemy's control of their defensive front to allow other squads to advance unopposed.\nUnited States Marines squads are arranged into \"Buddy Pairs\" and will assault in \"Buddy Rushes\", ensuring that one Marine is firing at the enemy while the other is maneuvering.\n\nIn this phase the squad consolidates its position by entrenchment, construction of fortifications, creation of passageways between structures and forward reconnaissance of surrounding areas. Minor chemical decontamination will commence as seals, respirators and masks are checked for damage. Body armor will be examined to replace damaged ceramic plates. Casualties will be treated, evacuated and/or replaced. The squad will use this period to familiarise itself with its surroundings, dig in to defensible positions, recharge itself, repair any damage to itself and prepare either for the next offensive movement, or go on the defensive against a counterattack.\n\nIn the defensive an isolated squad will allow a small element to hold a weak, easily evacuated position behind a remote detonated mine, flanked by a machine gun. As the enemy advances, the small forward element will pull back. When its former position is overrun the mine will be detonated to distract the attackers, and then the machine gun will open fire on the attacker's flank. The machine gun will then switch to engage and suppress the tail of the enemy assault as the rest of the squad manoeuvres against its dislocated and exposed flanks which have been pulled forward from their defensive line to support the head of the assault.\nIn the defensive a squad with a secure means of communication will fix the enemy in interlocked fields of fire and call in fire support from supporting units.\n\n", "id": "7706771", "categories": ["Land warfare"], "title": "Small unit tactics"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706853", "text": "Pandara Vanniyan\n\nPandara Vanniyan ( , ) was a Tamil Vanniar who ruled in Vanni Nadu in 18th century AD. He is referred to by some as the last Tamil king in Sri Lanka, who also rose to revolt against the British Ceylon empire and Dutch Ceylon empire, who died battling the British colonial rule on the island. He was officially declared a National Hero of Sri Lanka in 1982.\n\nKulasegaram Vairamuthu Pandara Vanniyan was a Vanniar of Vanni. Much remains unclear about his family, but reports state that he had one sister, Nallanachal Vanniyan, and two younger brothers called Kayilaya Vanniyan (Minister) and Periya Meynaar (Commander of the State). Pandara Vanniyan married Kumarasinghe Maha Vanniya’s family of present day Nuwara Wewa, who held the office of residential Governor and Custodian of the formerly Tamil area. Marriages between Vanniar Chieftain families in the northern and southern regions helped to unite and strengthen rule. Thus, when Pandara Vanniyan married into the Nuwara Wewa family, he gained political power in the south Vanni as well as in the north. It is said that he lived in Kumulamunai, which is today in Mullaitivu District.\n\nVanniar chieftain, Pandara Vanniyan, appeared to have paid some tribute to the more powerful rulers in the region at that time, who had an independent spirit and a distinct culture and dialect of their own. Vanni functioned as a buffer zone between the north and the south of Sri Lanka. Historically, the Vanni encompassed Mannar, Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, Ampara and Puttalam hinterlands. The name Vanni is said to be derived from the Sanskrit and Tamil word for forest (vannam) or fire (vahni), but there is also some historical evidence in Kalvettus(Stone Inscriptions) and classical songs that the Vanniar could have originally come from the large Vanniyar clan/ caste from North Arcot in South India.\n\nThe beginnings of the people of the Vanni (Vanniar), who were ruled over by Vanniar Chieftains, has not been clearly established, but there is evidence of settlements in the region dating back 2000 years. Furthermore, there is information on the Konesar Kalvettu and in the old 'Vya' song of sixty Vanniar coming from Madurai in South India, accompanying the royal bride for the king at Anuradhapura in the first century BC.\n\nWhen the Jaffna Kingdom was captured by the Portuguese in 1621, the Vanni was under their nominal control and it is thought that 'Parangichetticulam' of the Vanni is the former fort of the Portuguese.\n\nAround 1782, the continued conflicts came to an end when the Dutch, who had by then arrived in Sri Lanka, once and for all defeated the Vanniars. It has been noted that \"The Dutch met nowhere a more determined resistance than from one of the native princesses, the Vannichi (widow) Maria Sembatte, whom they [carried] away as prisoner, and [detained] in captivity in the Fort of Colombo.\"\n\nPandara Vanniyan fought against the British colonial powers. The Vanniars commenced to live a wild and marauding life and carried on a predatory warfare against the British in Mannar and Trincomalee, and even penetrated to the Jaffna peninsula. The British had to build forts along the river to keep them at bay. In alliance with the Kandy Kingdom, Vanniyan started a revolt to expel the British from his district. On 25 August 1803, Vanniyan attacked the Government House in Mullaitheevu and drove out the garrison from Mullaitheevu, which was under the command of Captain Edward Mudge of the 19th Regiment, before finally seizing the fort.\n\nHe captured the British cannons and overran the whole of the northern districts (Vanni), highlighting his boldness and ability to penetrate as far as Elephant Pass and into the Jaffna Peninsula. From conventional warfare, he resorted to guerrilla tactics, but was finally defeated by Lt. von Driberg when the (recently arrived) British organized a three-pronged attack from Jaffna, Mannar and Trincomalee in 1803. In that battle, the British also captured the cannon given to Pandara Vanniyan by Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe. The British presented the village of Pandara Kulam to Lt. von Driberg as a prize for defeating Pandara Vanniyan.\n\nThis was followed by the \"burning of all his houses, [whereby Pandara Vanniyan's] people ... dispersed into the jungle, and eventually out of the Vanni to the districts of Hanwella. The power of the Vanniar (Chieftains) was thus finally and effectually extinguished.\" Alternative histories have it that Lt. von Driberg of the Dutch forces felt humiliated by Pandara Vanniyan for having been defeated by him several times, including in a personal combat situation; despite being permitted by senior officials to withdraw, he stayed on even after the British ousted the Dutch.\n\nPandara Vanniyan fell in battle at the hands of Lt. von Driberg, on 31 October 1803 at Oddusuddan, Katsilaimadu. A granite stone monument commemorating Vanniyan's defeat was erected in the village Katsilaimadu in Vanni; it was placed in tribute by Lt. von Driberg, who had fought him in battle. The monument bears the inscription: “Here abouts Captain von Driberg Defeated Pandara Vawniyan Oct 31 st 1803.” In 2010 it was found broken; some Tamil media outlets reported that it had been damaged by Sinhalese soldiers in light of recent ethnic tensions and criticized it as an act of destruction of Tamil heritage and culture.\n\nPandara Vanniyan was declared a national hero by the Prime Minister in 1982 and a statue of him was opened with much fanfare in Vavuniya at the main junction on the A-9 Highway, where the Jaffna and Kandy (and Colombo) road meets the road to Mannar. The Pandara Vanniyan Memorial Day falls on 25 August each year.\n\nPresent-day Tamils and Sinhalese of North Central and North Western provinces in Sri Lanka, which were once part of Vanni, revere Pandara Vanniyan highly. The Sinhalese are known to summon the protection of Vanni Bandara Deio when they pass through jungles.\n\nTamil nationalists valourise Vanniyan as an epic hero, and his character has recently been appropriated and measured against Vellupillai Prabhakaran, the leader of the now dismantled LTTE. Minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi, an Indian politician and writer, in his novel 'Payum Puli Pandara Vanniyan' ('The Leaping Tiger Pandara Vanniyan' in English), uses Vanniyan to typify Tamil patriotism and transnationalism. According to Vijaya Ramaswamy in \"Historical Dictionary of the Tamils\", \"the course of the novel is ... connected to ... developments in Sri Lanka related to moves by the LTTE.\" The novel describes the mission of a friend of Veerapandiya Kattabomman (the last Poligar who resisted British rule in Tamil Nadu) to the Wanni jungles in Sri Lanka. His mission was to meet Pandara Vanniyan who was also resisting the British. This part of the novel echoes the meeting of V. Gopalsamy MP (popularly known as Vaiko) and Vellupillai Prabhakaran (leader of the defunct LTTE) in the dense jungles of Wanni.\"\n\nPandara Vanniyan is also the subject of the eponymous play by Mullaimaṇi Ve Cuppiramaṇiyam, 'Pantara Vanniyan.' The play was awarded a prize by the Ceylon Art Council in 1964, and was published thereafter in 1970.\n\nOn 10 August 2014, three statues of former Tamil kings including Pandara Vanniyan, Ellalan, and Pararaja Sekaran were installed by Jaffna Clock Tower.\n\n", "id": "7706853", "categories": ["Sri Lankan Tamil rebels", "Sri Lankan Tamil history", "Sri Lankan Hindus", "1803 deaths", "Hindu warriors", "Tamil monarchs", "British Empire"], "title": "Pandara Vanniyan"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706856", "text": "Criticism of Jesus\n\nJesus of Nazareth is the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe that he was (and still is) divine, while Islam considers him to have been a prophet, messenger and the Messiah. Since the time in which he is said to have lived, a number of noted individuals have criticised Jesus, some of whom were themselves Christians.\n\nEarly critics of Jesus and Christianity included Celsus in the second century and Porphyry in the third. In the 19th century, Friedrich Nietzsche was highly critical of Jesus, whose teachings he considered to be \"anti-nature\" in their treatment of topics such as sexuality. More contemporary notable critics of Jesus include Ayn Rand, Hector Avalos, Sita Ram Goel, Christopher Hitchens, Bertrand Russell, and Dayananda Saraswati.\n\nThe Pharisees and scribes criticized Jesus and his disciples for not observing Mosaic Law. They criticized his disciples for not washing their hands before eating. (The religious leaders engaged in ceremonial cleansing like washing up to the elbow and baptizing the cups and plates before eating food in them—, .) Jesus is also criticized for eating with the publicans (). The Pharisees also criticized Jesus' disciples for gathering grain on the Sabbath ().\n\nThe Jewish leaders attempted to stone Jesus for claiming to be God. Jesus' claim to Godhood is the main reason why Jews do not accept him as the Messiah, as the claim is contrary to Jewish monotheism. In Judaism, not only is there only one God but he is absolutely one, without parts or needs of any kind, so that a trinity or a mediator is impossible in Jewish theology.\n\nIn the latter half of the first century and into the second century, Jewish and pagan opponents of Christianity argued that the miracles and exorcisms of Jesus and his followers were the result of magic.\n\nAvery Robert Dulles held the opinion that \"Jesus, though he repeatedly denounced sin as a kind of moral slavery, said not a word against slavery as a social institution\", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either. In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, \"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery.\" Giles points to this fact as being used as an argument that Jesus approved of slavery. In certain major non-English translations, the first statement in the first sermon of Jesus (Luke 4:18), is a call to free the slaves: \"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the slaves from war...\" (see Cornilescu translation).\n\nCelsus, 2nd-century Greek philosopher and opponent of Early Christianity, mounts a wide criticism against Jesus as the founder of the Christian faith. He discounts or disparages Jesus' ancestry, conception, birth, childhood, ministry, death, resurrection, and continuing influence. According to Celsus, Jesus' ancestors came from a Jewish village. His mother was a poor country girl who earned her living by spinning cloth. He worked his miracles by sorcery and was a small, homely man. This Rabbi Jesus kept all Jewish customs, including sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem. He gathered only a few followers and taught them his worst habits, including begging for money. These disciples, amounting to \"ten boatmen and a couple of tax collectors\" were not respectable. The reports of his resurrection came from a hysterical female, and belief in the resurrection was the result of Jesus' sorcery and the crazed thinking of his followers, all for the purpose of impressing others and increasing the chance for others to become beggars.\n\nAccording to Celsus, Jesus was the inspiration for skulking rebels who deserve persecution.\n\nCelsus stated that Jesus was the bastard child of the Roman soldier Panthera or Pantera. These charges of illegitimacy are the earliest datable statement of the Jewish charge that Jesus was conceived as the result of adultery (see Jesus in the Talmud) and that his true father was a Roman soldier named Panthera. Panthera was a common name among Roman soldiers of that period. The name has some similarity to the Greek adjective \"parthenos\", meaning \"virgin\". The tomb of a Roman soldier named Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera, found in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, is taken by some scholars to refer to the Pantera named by Celsus.\n\nAccording to Celsus, Jesus had no standing in the Hebrew Bible prophecies and talk of his resurrection was foolishness.\n\nThe Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry of Tyre (c. 232–c. 304) authored the 15 volume treatise \"Against the Christians\", proscribed by the Emperors Constantine and Theodosius II, of which only fragments now survive and were collected by Adolf von Harnack. Selected fragments were published in English translation by J. Stevenson in 1957, of which the following is one example:\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, a 19th-century philosopher, has many criticisms of Jesus and Christianity, even going so far as to style himself as \"The Anti-Christ\". In \"Human, All Too Human\", and \"Twilight of the Idols\" for example, Nietzsche accuses the Church's and Jesus' teachings as being anti-natural in their treatment of passions, in particularly sexuality: \"There [In the Sermon on the Mount] it is said, for example, with particular reference to sexuality: 'If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out.' Fortunately, no Christian acts in accordance with this precept... the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.\" Nietzsche does explicitly consider Jesus as a mortal, and furthermore as ultimately misguided, the antithesis of a true hero, whom he posits with his concept of a Dionysian hero. Nietzsche was repulsed by Jesus' elevation of the lowly: \"Everything pitiful, everything suffering from itself, everything tormented by base feelings, the whole ghetto-world of the soul suddenly on top!\"\n\nHowever Nietzsche did not demur of Jesus, saying he was the \"only one true Christian\". He presented a Christ whose own inner life consisted of \"blessedness in peace, in gentleness, in the \"inability\" for enmity\". There is much criticism by Nietzsche of the organized institution of Christianity and its class of priests. Christ's evangelism consisted of the good news that the kingdom of God is within you. \"What are the 'glad tidings'? True life, eternal life is found—it is not promised, it is here, it is \"within you\": as life lived in love... 'Sin', every kind of distancing relationship between God and man, is abolished - \"precisely this is the 'glad tidings'.\" The 'glad tidings' are precisely that there are no more opposites...\"\n\nDayananda Saraswati, a 19th-century philosopher and the founder of Arya Samaj, in his book \"Satyarth Prakash\", criticized Christianity and described Jesus as a \"great thing in a country of uneducated savages\":\n\"All Christian missionaries say that Jesus was a very calm and peace-loving person. But in reality he was a hot-tempered person destitute of knowledge and who behaved like a wild savage. This shows that Jesus was neither the son of God, nor had he any miraculous powers. He did not possess the power to forgive sins. The righteous people do not stand in need of any mediator like Jesus. Jesus came to spread discord which is going on everywhere in the world. Therefore, it is evident that the hoax of Christ’s being the Son of God, the knower of the past and the future, the forgiver of sin, has been set up falsely by his disciples. In reality, he was a very ordinary ignorant man, neither learned nor a yogi.\"\n\nSaraswati asserted that Jesus wasn't an enlightened man either, and that if Jesus was a son of God, God would have saved him at the time of his death, and he wouldn't have suffered from severe mental and physical pain at last moments.\n\nNoting that the Bible writes that women held the feet of Jesus and worshiped him, he questions:\n\"Was it the same body which had been buried? Now that body had been buried for three days, we should like to know why did it not decompose?\"\n\nIn the 1927 essay \"Why I Am Not a Christian\", Russell pointed to parts of the gospel where Jesus is saying that his second coming will occur in the lifetime of some of his listeners (). He concludes from this that Jesus' prediction was incorrect and thus that Jesus was \"not so wise as some other people have been, and He was certainly not superlatively wise\".\n\nThough Russell believed Jesus 'had a very high degree of moral goodness', he also felt there were some notable flaws in his character. In his essay he wrote: \n\nRussell also expresses doubt over the historical existence of Jesus and questions the morality of religion: \"I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.\"\n\nNovelist and philosopher Ayn Rand denounced the altruist recipe that Jesus passed down to his pupils, and with it the idea of vicarious redemption. She thought that not even Christians, who think of Jesus in the highest possible terms, shouldn't feel outraged by the notion of sacrificing virtue to vice. Not surprisingly, her understanding of love as a consequence of the rational mind looking after embodied values attributes evil to the ideas Jesus is most famous for. Consider the following excerpt from a 1959 interview conducted by Mike Wallace:\nWallace: Christ, every important moral leader in man's history, has taught us that we should love one another. Why then is this kind of love in your mind immoral?<br>\nRand: It is immoral if it is a love placed above oneself. It is more than immoral, it's impossible. Because when you are asked to love everybody indiscriminately. That is to love people without any standard. To love them regardless of whether they have any value or virtue, you are asked to love nobody.\n\nNotwithstanding disagreements over the value of faith and the existence of an afterlife, Rand saw Jesus' insistence on procuring the eternal happiness of individuals as confirmation of the moral confusion and inconsistency in which much of religious ethics operates, including Christian altruism.\n\nIn For the New Intellectual, Rand further accuses Judeo-Christian tenets such as the doctrine of original sin for their conspicuous immorality. \"The evils for which they damn him [man] are reason, morality, creativeness, joy — all the cardinal values of his existence. It is not his vices that their myth of man’s fall is designed to explain and condemn. They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man.\" And proceeds to charge religious leaders with fostering a death cult: \"No, they say, they do not preach that man is evil, the evil is only that alien object: his body. No, they say, they do not wish to kill him, they only wish to make him lose his body.\"\n\nHistorian and Hindu activist Sita Ram Goel accused Jesus of being the intellectual author behind Western imperialism and the Holocaust.\nGoel further writes that Jesus \"is no more than an artifice for legitimizing wanton imperialist aggression. He does not symbolize spiritual power or moral uprightness.\"\n\nHe made his case based on the gospels, which he thought cast too dark a shadow on unconverted Jews (see for instance ). From there he drew parallels between Jesus and Adolf Hitler, the latter of whom was, in Goel's words, the first to \"completely grasp the verdict passed on the Jews by the Jesus of the gospels\".\n\nRam Goel also ridiculed what he termed \"the cult of the disentangled Christ\", whereby Christian revisionism attempts to salvage the figure of Jesus from the atrocious historical outcomes he inspired — and only from the bad ones — as though missionary proselytism and Western expansionism were to be perceived in the separate as mere coincidence.\n\nAuthor and journalist Christopher Hitchens, one of the leading exponents in the \"New Atheism\" movement, was extremely critical of Jesus, Christianity and any religion in general. Regarding Jesus' teachings on hell, Hitchens wrote:\n\"The god of Moses would call for other tribes, including his favorite one, to suffer massacre and plague and even extirpation, but when the grave closed over his victims he was essentially finished with them unless he remembered to curse their succeeding progeny. Not until the advent of the Prince of Peace do we hear of the ghastly idea of further punishing and torturing the dead.\"\n\nHitchens also felt that a divine Jesus would be the more morally problematic by virtue of the problem of evil, asking:\n\"If Jesus could heal a blind person he happened to meet, then why not heal blindness?\"\n\nSam Harris, author of The End of Faith, has expressed ambivalent views on Jesus' teachings. He argues that while Jesus may have been an insightful spiritual master of compassion at times, he also taught his followers to fulfill the barbaric law of the Old Testament, and gave his followers specifics on how to execute heretics. To Harris, Jesus' unresolved frustration and hatred of non-Christians runs contrary to the imagination of contemporary religious moderates, and actually lends honesty to more fundamentalist interpretations of salvation and hell. He wrote:\n\nTo the same end of exposing Jesus in relation to the doctrine of hell, Harris quotes Luke's version of the parable of the talents, which ends with the nobleman character saying:\n\nWhich is taken to be a self-portrait of Jesus and his own eschatological views.\n\nHector Avalos is perhaps the first openly atheist biblical scholar to write a systematic critique of the ethics of Jesus in his book, \"The Bad Jesus: The Ethics of New Testament Ethics\". Koowon Kim, an associate professor in the Old Testament at Reformed Graduate University in South Korea remarks in his review of \"The Bad Jesus\": \"Whether or not one agrees with the author’s conclusions, this book is the first systematic challenge to New Testament ethics by an atheist scholar firmly grounded in the Hebrew Bible and its ancient Near Eastern context and well-versed in New Testament and Early Christianity.\"\n\nIn a review in \"Bilbilcal Theology Bulletin\", Sarah Rollens, a New Testament scholar at Rhodes College, remarks: \"Hector Avalos aims not only to convince us that many portrayals of Jesus based on New Testament texts are morally or ethically problematic, but also to demonstrate how scholars have engaged in questionable distortions to minimize, explain away, or otherwise ignore any textual evidence that might not comport with modern ethical standards.\"\n\nJudaism, which includes Orthodox Judaism, Haredi Judaism, Hasidic Judaism, Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism, Karaite Judaism, and Samaritan Judaism, entirely rejects the idea of Jesus being a god, a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God who has a special relationship with Him that somehow makes Jesus \"divine\". Moreover, it is \"Avodah Zarah\" (\"foreign worship\", which means idolatry) to regard or worship a human being as God; in Judaism, as well as in Islam, God is only One, totally transcendent, and cannot be human (Exodus , Deuteronomy , ).\n\nJudaism also holds that Jesus couldn't be the Jewish Messiah, arguing that he had not fulfilled any of the Messianic prophecies foretold in the Tanakh, nor did he embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah foretold by the Prophets. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after Malachi, who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophecies about 420 BCE. Thus Judaism is critical of Jesus' own claims and allusions about his alleged messiahship and his identification as the \"son of God\", as presented in the New Testament, and considers Jesus to be just one of many individuals who claimed to be the Messiah, but didn't fulfill any of the Messianic prophecies; therefore, they were all impostors.\n\nThe \"Mishneh Torah\", one of the most authoritative works of Jewish law, written by Moses Maimonides, provides the last established consensus view of the Jewish community, in \"Hilkhot Melakhim\" 11:10–12 that Jesus is a \"stumbling block\" who makes \"the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God\".\n\n\n", "id": "7706856", "categories": ["Criticism of Christianity", "Jesus"], "title": "Criticism of Jesus"}

He was a son of Sam Nhean, a prominent politician in the 1940s, and father of Sam Rainsy, the leader of Cambodia's main opposition party. He was a close confidant of the then Prince Norodom Sihanouk but had a falling-out with the Prince when he was exposed in corruption, selling import licenses and a second time during his tenure as a Cambodian ambassador to London in 1958, for beating his pregnant servant. He was alleged to have beaten her so badly that she escaped to the protection of the London police. The scandal made headlines in the London tabloids and he was recalled to Cambodia and stripped of all of his duties. He disappeared mysteriously in 1962.\n\nSam Sary was Deputy Prime Minister in Prince Norodom Sihanouk's government in the 1950s. He played an important role in seeking full independence for Cambodia, in helping the newly independent Cambodia avoid partition at the Geneva conference (1954), and in helping King \"Norodom Sihanouk\" found the Sangkum Reastr Niyum (1955 onwards).\n\nHe was involved in election fraud and intimidations, Keng Vannsak recalled: The evil genius behind the repression was Sam Sary—a bestial man. As an investigating magistrate in the 1940s, he had beaten suspects to death with his own hands. Then he went study in France. In 1955, he joined the Sangkum and became Sihanouk's closest aide ... After Sihanouk decided to use strong-arm tactics, Sary handed out money and arms to hire ruffians to come and break our meetings. \n\nIn January 1958, Sam Sary was appointed by Norodom Sihanouk as Cambodia's ambassador to London, thus extricating him from a scandal involving smuggling of large quantities of high grade Cambodian pepper. According to \"Time\" magazine, he brought an entourage of four woman who were his official wife, with their five children, including Sam Rainsy and three mistresses. Six months later, Sam Sary was involved in another scandal when one of his female servants—Iv Eng Seng, who bore him a child—went to the London police, accusing him of severely beating her for \"minor mistakes\". By other accounts, her name was Soeung Son Maly and she used to date Saloth Sar (Pol Pot), later dumping him for more prosperous Sam Sary. Sam Sary was recalled to Phnom Penh, but not before he had put his side of the story to the British press. He admitted to having beaten his servant,saying: \nI corrected her by hitting her with a Cambodian string whip. I never hit her on the face, always across the back and the thighs—a common sort of punishment in my country.\n\nHe argued his right to do so because \n\nthe embassy is \"Cambodia in London.\"\nAfter coming back to Cambodia, Sam Sary became more and more anti-Sihanouk. Despite the risk of incurring Sihanouk's displeasure, Sam Sary started a newspaper, openly critical of the Prince's policies. He tried to start his own political party but without success. His anti-Sihanouk activities were dubbed the Sam Sary Affairs.\n\nSome commentators contend that Sam Sary worked with U.S. intelligence services, which he might have contacted in 1956 while visiting the U.S. On 13 January 1959, in a speech delivered in Kampong Cham, Sihanouk told his listeners that he knew about U.S. intelligence plots to overthrow him. While this speech had not clearly implicated Sam Sary, a week after the speech was delivered, he fled to Thailand. After a shadowy existence in exile, he disappeared in 1963.\n\n\n", "id": "7706888", "categories": ["1960s deaths", "1917 births", "Ambassadors of Cambodia to the United Kingdom", "Government ministers of Cambodia", "Missing people"], "title": "Sam Sary"}
