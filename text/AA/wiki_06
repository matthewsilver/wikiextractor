{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7721493", "text": "Japanese possessives\n\nThe Japanese language has different ways of expressing the possessive relation. There are several \"verbal possessive\" forms based on verbs with the sense of \"to possess\" or \"to have\" or \"to own\". An alternative is the use of the particle \"no\" (の) between two nouns or noun phrases.\n\nShoyuu (所有) is a Japanese noun of Sino-Japanese origin. It translates as ‘the state of possession’ or ‘ownership’. In Japanese, nouns, mainly those of Chinese origin, may attached themselves to the verb suru (する), ‘to do’, to form a compound verb. The verb ‘to come to possess/own’, shoyuusuru, is formed in this manner.\nShoyuusuru is considered a formal term, used in reference to possessions with legal certification such as cars, in comparison to the native Japanese counterpart motsu (持つ), generally meaning ‘to come to have/own/possess’.\nBoth motsu and shoyuusuru require animate possessors and controllable alienable possessees. The possessee may be human/animate but must be controllable, for example, a possessee cannot be a father/mother and such. The possessor noun phrase is the subject, as indicated by the particle ga (が), and the possessee noun phrase is the object, which is indicated by the particle o (を).\n\n\nJapanese verbs do not recognise the difference between present and future form. There is no verbal conjugation which translates as ‘I will do this.’ The ‘plain’ form of the verbs shoyuusuru and motsu cannot be used to express present states. In order to do this, as seen in (1) and (2), the verb must be changed into its –te form and have the verb ‘to be (animate)’ – iru (いる) attached. This form indicates a continuous state of being – ‘I have, and I continue to have…’\n\n3)所有する　shoyuusuru\n所有して　shoyuushi-te\n所有している　shyoyuushi-te iru\n‘to have/possess/own’\n\n4)持つ　motsu\n持って　mot-te\n持っている　mot-te iru\n'to have/possess/own'\n\nThe sentence structure to be used when using shyoyuusuru and motsu to describe possession is\n\n5) NP1 ga NP2 o Verb-te iru\nPossessor Subject-marker Possessee Object-marker Verb-te iru\n\nIru (いる) and aru (ある) are the present/future ‘plain’ form of the verb translated as ‘to be/exist’. Iru is always used in reference to an animate subject or object, and aru always refers to an object or subject that is inanimate;\n\n6) jon-san/hon wa Osaka ni i-ru/ar-u\nJohn/book SUB Osaka NI be-PRES\n‘John/The book is in Osaka.’\n\nWhen the verb is used following an object marked with ga and a subject marked with ni (に), the translation becomes ‘to have’. For example,\n\n7) jon-san ni kuruma ga ar-u\nJohn NI car OBJ have-PRES\n‘John has a car’.\n\nTo arrive at this translation, the particle ni is read, in this context, as ‘in/at’, the place where something is at the present. So at first, the translation for (7) may be considered ‘a car is at John/in John’s presence’. In order to reach the translation ‘to have’, Tsujioka presents these two examples:\n\n8)*heya ni otoko ga ar-u\nRoom NI man OBJ be-PRES\n‘There is a man in the room.’\n\n9) jon-san ni musuko ga ar-u\nJohn NI son OBJ be-PRES\n‘John has a son’\n\nSentence (8) is grammatically incorrect, as aru is used in reference to an animate object. The use of musuko with aru, however, is allowed, as some kinship terms may use the ‘animacy-insensitive’ form of aru. It can then be said that there are two translations of aru/iru – ‘to be’ and ‘to have’.\n\nUnlike shoyuusuru and motsu however, iru/aru can express relationship as well as ownership, as seen in (9) where John does not physically own his son. Rather, it is a statement expressing the relationship.\n\nAlthough iru/aru sentences may have a possessee that is alienable and inalienable, it is not possible to have a modified inalienable possessee;\n\n10) *jon-san ni pinku no kami ga ar-u\nJohn NI pink GEN hair OBJ be-PRES\n‘John has pink hair.’\n\nThis appears to be the only restraint, other than the animate/inanimate restrictions, and its solution will be discussed in the next section.\n\n11) NP1 ni NP2 ga Verb.\nPossessor NI Possessee OBJ Verb\n\nAs mentioned, the iru/aru form of possessive sentences does not allow for modified possessees. There is however another verbal possessive which does allow for modified possessees, in fact the possessee must be modified and may only be inalienable. This is suru (する). The sentence structure for possessive suru sentences is the same as that of shyoyuusuru/motsu sentences:\n\n12) NP1 ga NP2 o shi-te i-ru\nPossessor SUB Possessee OBJ do-PART be-PRES\n\nSuru translates as ‘do’, using the form seen in (12), shi-te iru, translates as ‘doing’. This is constructed in the same manner as shyoyuushi-te iru and mot-te iru;\n\n13)suru\nshi-te\nshi-te iru\n‘is doing’\n\nAs with the Shoyuu/motsu sentences, suru possessive sentences only express ownership and not relationships (as the possessee must be inalienable, as aforementioned):\n\n14) jon-san ga pinku no kami o shi-te i-ru\nJohn SUBJ pink hair GEN OBJ do-PART be-PRES\n‘John has pink hair.’\n\nThe verb zokusuru （属する）is translated as ‘to belong to’ or ‘to be affiliated with’. The verb does \"not\" indicate belonging in the sense of ownership, but rather affiliation. For example, the following is incorrect\n\n15) *kono hon wa jon-san ni zokushi-te i-ru\nThis book SUB John NI belong-PART be-PRES\n‘This book belongs to John.’\n\nThis sentence is grammatically incorrect. Zokusuru can only be used when describing affiliation, such as in (16):\n\n16) jon-san wa ANU ni zokushi-te i-ru\nJohn SUB ANU NI belong-PART be-PRES\n‘John belongs to/is affiliated with the ANU.’\n\nThis verb is included in this list in order to describe the difference in translation meanings.\n\nThe particle \"no\" (の) is used to express possession, either figuratively or literally, of one noun phrase by a second noun phrase, by indicating that the noun preceding \"no\" is the possessor, and the noun following is the possessee. Both the possessor and the possessee can be alienable or inalienable:\n\n(20)\"watashi no te\" \n私の手\nme NO hand\n'My hand.'\n\n21)\" jon no kuruma\"　\nジョンの車\nJohn NO car\n'John's car.'\n\nIn this way, no may modify an unlimited number of nouns, for example\n\n22)\" watashi no inu no beddo...\"　\n私のいぬのベッド\nme NO dog NO bed...\n'My dog's bed...'\n\nIn the same way, this noun-no-noun structure also indicates relationships between the possessor and uncontrollable possessees. For example,\n\n23)\"watashi no okasan\"　\n私のお母さん\nme NO mother\n'My mother.'\n\n24) \"jon no ani\"　\nジョンの兄\nJohn NO big brother\n'John's big brother'\n\nThe possessee can be pronominalised by replacing it with either mono (もの), which translates as ‘one’, as in ‘John’s one’, or Ø (0 particle). Japanese often omits proper nouns and subjects once they have already been mentioned in a conversation, and which are then understood through context. In the following sentences, desu (です) the copula translates as ‘is’,\n\n25)\"kore wa jon no mono desu\"　\nこれはジョンの物です\nthis SUB John NO one COP\n‘This is John’s one.’\n\n26) \"kore wa jon no Ø desu\"　\nこれはジョンの～です\nthis SUB John NO Ø COP\n‘This is John’s.’\n\nThere is a slight difference in meaning between the two pronouns. As Hirakouji states, mono-pronominalisation refers to the possessee as an objectively viewed object, while Ø-pronominalisation conveys the speaker’s subjective attention to the object and inclusive contrast, and cannot appear in the ordinary focus position. Hirakouji presents the following examples (in (28), the first no is used to nominalise the preceding clause) to demonstrate how Ø-pronominalisation cannot be used in the ordinary focus position (27 is incorrect):\n\n27)*\"kore wa merii no Ø desu ga, are wa jon Ø desu\"　\nこれはメリーの～ですがあれはジョン～です\nthis SUB Mary NO Ø COP but, that SUB John Ø COP\n‘This is Mary’s, but that is John’s.’\n\n28)\"watashi ga hoshii no wa merii no Ø desu\"　\nme SUB want NOM OBJ Mary NO Ø COP\n‘What I want is Mary’s.’\n\nThe phrase structure when using no as a possessive particle is indicated in (29). The phrase constitutes a noun phrase.\n\n29)([NOUN (possessor)] no [NOUN (possessee)])\n\n(2001). Kodansha’s furigana: English-Japanese dictionary. Kodansha Ltd.: Japan.\n\n(2001).

These deaths became the opening act for further killings carried out on the civilian population of Menemen the following day by a Cretan brigade aided by a number of accomplices from the local Greek minority. The event was termed as a \"massacre\" by an inter-allied commission composed of four generals representing the Allied Powers. The commission also said that the massacre was not organized by the Greek Command, but was as a result of the panic and anger of the young troops who were still affected by the Pergamos (Bergama) events and whom their officers were not able to calm. At Pergamos, the Turkish irregulars who retook the city murdered the Turkish inhabitants who welcomed the Greeks and also massacred and tortured all the Greek soldiers who were prisoners.\n\nThe number of casualties among the civilian Turkish population of the town during the single day of June 17 vary between two hundred, according to the October 1919 report drawn up by the Inter-Allied Commission; to one thousand, according to a delegation that arrived the next day (June 18, 1919). Captain Charns, the head of that delegation, contrasted the number of Turkish victims against the non-existence of any Greek wounded, either civilian or military. The October report, prepared by the British officers and medical delegates from the British and Italian consulates in Smyrna, rejected the 1000 casualties figure as an exaggeration, finding that at least 100 had died, and mentioning a French officer's investigation the day after the massacre reporting that 200 Turks had been killed, and 200 injured. \n\nThe events were protested by the Ottoman Sheikhulislam. The Greek military claimed that they were attacked in the town, but the commission did not give credit to their statements. They found the Greeks alone responsible for the bloodshed. \n\nDemographer Justin McCarthy, rejecting the findings of the Inter-Allied Commission, claimed the massacre was preplanned, indicated by the fact that before the attacks all Greek houses in the city had been marked with white crosses and were not affected by the pillage and destruction.\n\nBritish Admiral Calthorpe, commenting to London on the fact that some Turks of Menemen had managed to survive, stated:\n\nCelal Bayar, the third Turkish president, wrote the testimony of the local merchant; Çerkes Sefer Efendi.\n\n", "id": "7721500", "categories": ["Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)", "Aftermath of World War I in Turkey", "Aidin Vilayet", "Massacres in Turkey", "1919 in the Ottoman Empire", "Mass murder in 1919", "Anti-Turkism"], "title": "Menemen massacre"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7721553", "text": "History of slavery in New Jersey\n\nSlavery in New Jersey began in the early 17th century, when Dutch colonists imported African slaves for labor to develop their colony of New Netherland. After England took control the colony in 1664, its colonists continued the importation of slaves from Africa. They also imported \"seasoned\" slaves from their colonies in the West Indies and enslaved Native Americans from the Carolinas.\n\nMost Dutch and English immigrants entered the colony as indentured servants, who worked for a fixed number of years to repay their passage. As conditions in England improved and the number of indentured laborers declined, New Jersey's colonists imported more Africans for needed labor. To promote increasing the number of laborers and settlers in order to develop the colony, the colonial government awarded settlers headrights of of land for each person transported to the colony. In 1704, after East Jersey and West Jersey unified, the Province of New Jersey passed a slave code prohibiting slaves and free blacks from owning property, further restricting African Americans in the state.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, enslaved African Americans fought on each side. The British Crown promised freedom to slaves who would leave their rebel masters and fight for the British. The number of blacks in Manhattan increased to 10,000, as thousands of slaves escaped to the British for the promise of freedom. The British refused to return former slaves to the Americans and they evacuated many Black Loyalists together with their troops and other Loyalists; they resettled more than 3,000 freedmen in their colony of Nova Scotia. Others were transported to England and the West Indies.\n\nBergen County developed as the largest slaveholding county in the state, in part because many slaves were used as laborers in its ports and cities. After the Revolutionary War, many northern states rapidly passed laws to abolish slavery, but New Jersey did not abolish it until 1804, and then in a process of gradual emancipation similar to that of New York. But, in New Jersey, some slaves were held as late as 1865. (In New York, they were all freed by 1840.) The law made African Americans free at birth, but it required children (born to slave mothers), to serve lengthy apprenticeships as a type of indentured servant until early adulthood for the masters of their slave mothers. New Jersey was the last of the Northern states to abolish slavery completely. The last 16 slaves in New Jersey were freed in 1865 by the Thirteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Underground Railroad had several routes crossing the state, four of which ended in Jersey City, where fugitive slaves could cross the Hudson River. New Brunswick, 'Hub City', was a main location where runaways would travel during the days of the Underground Railroad. During the American Civil War, African Americans served in several all-black Union Army regiments from New Jersey.\n\nIn 2008, the legislature of New Jersey passed a resolution of official apology for slavery, becoming the third state to do so. Rutgers, the State University moved to rectify its past wrongs and connections to slavery during its 250th anniversary celebration in 2016. Princeton University, the oldest college in the state of New Jersey, released the findings of its Princeton & Slavery Project in 2017.\n\nThe Dutch West India Company introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves to New Amsterdam, capital of the nascent province of New Netherland. They worked as farmers, fur traders, and builders. It later expanded across the North River (Hudson River) to Pavonia and Communipaw, eventually becoming Bergen, where slaves worked the company plantation. Settlers to the area later held slaves privately, often using them as domestic servants and laborers. Although enslaved, the Africans had a few basic rights and families were usually kept intact. They were admitted to the Dutch Reformed Church and married by its ministers, who also baptized their children. While enslaved Africans could be admitted to the Church, the church itself did not prohibit their enslavement. In fact, the Church did not even find that enslavement sinful. Slaves could testify in court, sign legal documents, and bring civil actions against whites. Some were permitted to work after hours, when they earned wages equal to those paid to white workers. When the colony fell, the company freed all its slaves, establishing early on a nucleus of free negros.\n\nEnglish traders continued to import African slaves after they took over the colony from the Dutch in 1664 and established a proprietorship. Eager to attract more settlers and laborers to develop the colony, the proprietorship encouraged the importation of slaves for labor by offering settlers headrights, an award of allocations of land based on the number of workers, slaves or indentured servants, imported to the colony. The first African slaves to appear in English records were owned by Colonel Lewis Morris in Shrewsbury. In an early attempt to encourage European settlement, the New Jersey legislature enacted a prohibitive tariff against imported slaves to encourage European indentured servitude. When this act expired in 1721, however, the British Government and New Jersey's royal governor, countered attempts to renew it. The slave trade was a royal monopoly and had become a lucrative enterprise.\n\nThe liberties of the enslaved peoples of New Jersey were formally curtailed under a law passed in 1704, a so-called 'slave code'. This code prohibited the owning of property for not only slaves, but also free African Americans as well. In addition, it made certain actions illegal for African Americans, like staying out past curfew, that were not illegal for European Americans.\n\nCamden was a center for the importation of slaves, its ferry docks on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia acting as auction sites for the plantations in the Delaware Valley, of which Pomona Hall was one.\n\nIn 2016 Rutgers University published a report \"Scarlet and Black\" recording the university's relationship with slavery. In 2017 Princeton University made public the findings of the Princeton & Slavery Project, which is ongoing.\n\nAfrican-American slaves fought on both sides in the War for Independence. The British Crown promised slaves freedom for leaving their rebel masters to join their cause. The number of blacks in New York rose to 10,000 as slaves escaped there from both northern and southern masters after the British occupied the city. The British kept their promise and evacuated thousands of freedmen from New York, resettling 3,500 Black Loyalists in its colony of Nova Scotia and others in the Caribbean islands. Colonel Tye, also known as Titus Cornelius (c. 1753–1780), was a slave of African descent who achieved notability during the war by his leadership and fighting skills, and was one of the most effective guerrilla leaders opposing the American rebel forces in Central Jersey.\n\nFollowing the Revolutionary War in the 1780s, New Jersey initially resisted the urge to free slaves due to a desire to re-build their devastated economy. According to the American historian Giles Wright, by 1790 New Jersey's enslaved population numbered approximately 14,000. They were virtually all of African descent. The 1790 federal census, however, recorded 11,423 slaves, 6.2 percent of the total population of 184,139. In the decades before the Revolution, slaves were numerous near Perth Amboy, a major point of entry, and in the eastern counties. Slaves were generally used for agricultural labor, but they also filled skilled artisan jobs in shipyards and industry in coastal cities.\n\nFollowing the Revolutionary War, New Jersey banned the importation of slaves in 1788, but at the same time forbade free blacks from elsewhere from settling in the state. In the first two decades after the war many northern states rapidly abolished slavery, and some slaveholders independently manumitted their slaves. Some people of color left the areas where they had been enslaved and moved to more frontier areas. Since slaves were widely used in agriculture, as well as the ports, the New Jersey state legislature was the last in the North to abolish slavery, passing a law in 1804 for its gradual abolition. The 1804 statute and subsequent laws freed children born after the law was passed. African Americans born to slave mothers after July 4, 1804 had to serve lengthy apprenticeships to the owners of their mothers. Women were freed at 21, but men were not emancipated until the age of 25. Slaves who had been born before these laws were passed were considered, after 1846, as indentured servants who were \"apprenticed for life.\"\n\nAlthough at first New Jersey allowed free people of color to vote, the legislature disfranchised them in 1807, an exclusion that lasted until 1875. By 1830 two-thirds of the slaves remaining in the North were held by masters in New Jersey, as New York had freed the last of its slaves in 1827 under gradual abolition. It was not until 1846 that New Jersey abolished slavery, but it qualified it by redefining former slaves as apprentices who were \"apprenticed for life\" to their masters. Slavery did not truly end in the state until it was ended nationally in 1865 after the American Civil War and passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution.\n\nAccording to historian James Gigantino (University of Arkansas), during the early nineteenth century in New Jersey, there were more female than male slaves. After the passage of the Act of Gradual Abolition in New Jersey in 1804, a greater number of advertisements in the state for the full-title sale of female slaves of child-bearing age were published. Female slaves and their reproductive capabilities were highly valuable because their children would be born as slaves for a term, even after the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition. However, domestic skills and labor also affected the value and marketability of female slaves. By 1830, African Americans made up 6% of the total population of New Jersey. The city of New Brunswick had a large African American population at an around 11%. This added one of the reasons why New Brunswick was a favorable location for runaways, but it also made the city into a popular site for slave hunters, who wished to enforce the federal fugitive slave laws of 1850. In more urban areas of the state, like New Brunswick, there were frequent advertisements for the sale of female slaves, both before and after passage of the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition. This was because female slaves were more highly favored for domestic work, which was in greater demand in urban spaces like New Brunswick. Enslaved women, however, also performed manual labor across the state of New Jersey.\n\nYet the Gradual Abolition Act of 1804 did not guarantee that a slave born after 1804 would gain their freedom. Slaveholders would regularly sell those slaves down south to states like Louisiana before the slaves reached manumission age. By the 1830s, slavery was on the decline in New Jersey.\n\nCommunities of free negros and freedmen formed at Dunkerhook in Paramus and at the New York state line at Skunk Hollow, also called The Mountain. A founding African-American settler bought land there in 1806, and later bought more. Other families joined him, and the community continued into the twentieth century. According to the historian David S. Cohen in \"The Ramapo Mountain People\" (1974), free people of color migrated from Manhattan into other parts of the frontier of northeastern New Jersey, where some intermarried and became ancestors of the Ramapo Mountain Indians. (Cohen's findings have been disputed by some scholars, including Albert J. Catalano.)\n\nAccording to Gigantino, one in ten slaves in New Jersey remained enslaved for life. Many slaveholders sold their slaves to Southern slaveholders, and displayed antipathy toward abolition. He stated that about one quarter of New Jersey's African American population was forced into labor during the 1830s. Improper information regarding who was free led to it appearing as though slavery decreased more rapidly than it actually did.\n\nA total of 2,909 United States Colored Troops from New Jersey served in the Union Army. Because of the state's long-term apprenticeship requirements, at the close of the American Civil War, some African Americans in New Jersey remained in bondage. It was not until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed in 1865 that the last 16 slaves in the state were freed.\n\nIn the 1860 census, free colored persons in New Jersey numbered 25,318, about 4% of the state's population of 672,035. By 1870 the number had increased to 30,658, but they constituted a smaller percentage of the total population because of the high rate of European immigration. Overall, New Jersey's population had increased to 906,096, with nearly 200,000 European immigrants.\n\nNew Jersey was slow to abolish slavery and reluctant to pass the 13th Amendment, which it did in January 1866. Some of its industries, such as shoes and clothing, had strong markets in the South supplying planters for their slaves, which was probably a factor.\n\nOn March 31, 1870 Thomas Mundy Peterson (1824–1904) became the first African American to vote in an election under the just-enacted provisions of the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nIn 1875, \"Jack\" Jackson, described in a newspaper as \"the last slave in New Jersey,\" died at the age of 87 on the Smith family farm at Secaucus. Abel Smith had manumitted his slaves in 1820, but Jackson \"refused to accept his liberty\" and remained on the family estate until his death. By the will of the late Abel Smith, Jackson was interred in the family burial ground.\n\nIn 2008, the New Jersey Legislature acknowledged the state's role in the history of slavery in the United States.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7721553", "categories": ["Slavery in the United States by state", "History of New Jersey"], "title": "History of slavery in New Jersey"}

The song was the first single from the group's sixth album, \"The Great Burrito Extortion Case\", and was released on September 19, 2006. The song deals with the frustration of graduating from high school and seeing that modern popular culture is very similar to the obnoxiously superficial and materialistic culture in high school.\n\nThe tune had a prominent outside songwriter, Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne and Tinted Windows, working with the band. It was heard in the promos in \"The Goldbergs\" spinoff, \"Schooled\".\n\nThe song contains many references to the pop culture of the time. Specific celebrities mentioned include Mary-Kate Olsen (specifically, her alleged eating disorder - \"How did Mary Kate lose all that weight?\"), Jessica Simpson (\"you'll never guess what Jessica did\"), Bill Gates (\"Bill Gates, captain of the chess team\"), Reese Witherspoon (\"Reese Witherspoon, she's the prom queen\"), Jack Black (\"Jack Black, the clown\"), Brad Pitt (\"Brad Pitt, the quarterback\") and Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes (\"Katie had a baby so I guess Tom's straight\", also a reference to his litigation against journalists/paparazzi who questioned his sexuality). The song satirizes many aspects of today's society and its scrutiny of celebrity lives.\n\nDirected by Frank Borin, the video focuses on the band members going to their high school reunion, while another version of them performs the song onstage. They arrive, instantly recognizing people from the past that bullied them. During a montage, the band gets revenge on their former bullies in situations similar to their high school past.\n\nThe first flashback shows Gary Wiseman getting a wedgie by some bullies, who hang him on the flagpole by his underwear. Gary takes his revenge by grabbing the underwear of the bully and pulling it over his head while he is still wearing it.\n\nThe next flashback involves Erik Chandler getting a note reading \"kick me\" taped to his back by a jock. Erik gets him back by sticking the punch bowl sign (which simply reads \"PUNCH\") on his back; this starts a queue of people ready to punch the jock, including a nun, a pimp, a cowboy and a knight in armor.\n\nAfter the sequence of celebrities references, Jaret Reddick invites a guy onstage who had embarrassed him at high school, by pulling down his pants in front of a girl he was obviously keen of, revealing his pink underwear. Jaret pulls his pants down onstage as his act of revenge. The popular guy then explodes in embarrassment after a sign stating \"TOO SMALL FOR TV\" appears strategically over his crotch.\n\nFinally, Chris Burney has a flashback of him being slipped a laxative by a cheerleader and manages to get his own back by consuming a massive sub sandwich, a chili removed from his pants, a white mouse, gasoline, and a goldfish. After jiggling around, he then confronts the popular girl and presents the contents of his stomach upon her–by projectile vomiting. After Chris' revenge, the band finishes the song, Jaret sticks his guitar pick to his rather sweaty forehead and the video ends with a disclaimer that states \"No animals or children under 15 were harmed in the making of this video\".\n\nA separate edit of the song was recorded for Radio Disney, which altered the lyrics throughout:\n\n\nOn the week of November 25, 2006, \"High School Never Ends\" debuted and peaked at number 97 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, before leaving the chart completely. For the week ending January 28, 2007, the song debuted at number 70 on the UK Singles Chart. It peaked at number 40 the next week and remained on the chart for four weeks.\n", "id": "7721592", "categories": ["2006 songs", "Songs written by Adam Schlesinger", "Bowling for Soup songs", "2006 singles", "Jive Records singles"], "title": "High School Never Ends"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7721600", "text": "Erlembald\n\nSaint Erlembald (or Erlembaldo Cotta) (\"Sanctus Herlembaldus\" in Latin) (died 15 April 1075) was the political and military leader of the movement known as the \"pataria\" in Milan, a movement to reform the clergy and the church in the Ambrosian diocese.\n\nHe was the brother of Landulf, subdeacon of Milan. They were of the Cotta, a family of valvassores and vassals of the archdiocese. In his early career, Erlembald was referred to as a \"captain.\" In 1063, he returned from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and intended to become a monk when the deacon Ariald convinced him to take his brother's place at the head of the \"pataria\". Erlembald, however, was not a cleric, but a soldier.\n\nIn 1064, he travelled to Rome to confer with Pope Alexander II and confirm his support. On his return to Milan, he revealed the change in the character of the \"pataria\" by living in a palace near the church of Saint Victor and the Forty Martyrs. With papal permission he began imposing his will by force on the clergy, by deposing abbots and proceeding against the bishop, Guido da Velate. Guido was first accused of taking false oaths for not acting against simony in his province. Guido, however, organised a resistance to the \"patarini\". Because of this, Ariald imposed the interdict on the city during the feast of the Ascension. The populace turned against him and he fled to Pavia. After being captured en route to Rome, Ariald was executed and his body thrown in Lake Maggiore. On 3 May 1067, Erlembald recovered his body and reburied it in S. Celso in Milan on 17 May. Ariald's popularity was also recovered after the lifting of the interdict. A papal legation lent Erlembald much needed moral support at a congregation at Vallambrosa.\n\nIn 1069, Guido renounced the see to Gotofredo da Castiglione with the support of the Emperor Henry IV. Gotofredo was immediately besieged in his castle. On 7 March 1070, violence broke out again in Milan and Gotofredo was arrested. That year, Guido request his archbishopric back from Erlembald. He was refused, but the \"patarino\" leader put him in S. Celso and then in the see of Bergoglio. On 6 January 1072, Erlembald appointed Atto archbishop in opposition to the arrested Gotofredo. Strong opposition from the German court evaporated suddenly in 1073 when Henry was troubled by revolts in Saxony and had to ceded his rights in Milan to Pope Gregory VII. Gregory confirmed Atto and lent his support to Erlembald.\n\nAt this, the height of his power, an unfortunate fire broke out in the city and was interpreted as divine punishment for supporting the controversial \"pataria\". The opposition factions in Milan signed a pact against Erlembald. He put down the revolt, but was killed in the battle and buried in S. Celso. From 6 to 26 May in 1095, Pope Urban II was present at Milan for the transferral of the relics of the canonised Erlembald to S. Dionigi. He was already a propaganda tool at the time of the preaching of the First Crusade. He was translated once more in 1528 to the Duomo. His feast day is 27 July.\n\n", "id": "7721600", "categories": ["Medieval Italian saints", "1075 deaths", "Italian untitled nobility", "11th-century births", "11th-century Italian people"], "title": "Erlembald"}

The show, previously known as The Manila International Motor Show, is an annual venue for car buyers and enthusiasts alike to take a closer look at the latest models and significant concepts from the Philippines’ premiere auto makers.\n\nIn South East Asia, the Philippines is one of the seats of automotive history. In the years after World War II, the Philippines became an attractive venue for foreign investment. Japanese companies seeking to expand their market penetration established factories in this country. There were notable early successes: In 1955, Mercedes-Benz established an assembly plant in the Philippines that was the first in the world outside of Germany, to produce its E-Class sedan. In 1972, GM established a jointly owned vehicle and transmission manufacturing operation in the Philippines with two Philippine companies. In 1979, Isuzu Motors invests in the venture, GM Pilipinas, Inc.\n\nDuring the Martial Law regime of Ferdinand Marcos, foreign investment dried up, and most car companies shuttered their operations in the country. Stalwarts such as Toyota and Ford stopped producing and selling cars. GM Pilipinas’ assembly and transmission plants ceased operation in 1985. With the restoration of a credible government, and establishment of freer trade policies, the Philippines was again back on the map. Soon, carmakers were establishing new facilities in the region, and the Philippines attracted it share of investment.\n\nIn a land once called the Pearl of the Orient, where “Jeepneys” and “Calesas” were once the king of the road, Manila is now positioning to be an automotive force to reckon with. With production figures inching closely to pre-Asian crisis volumes, the automotive industry appears to be shifting to a higher gear.\n\nThe clamour for growth and the need for the automotive brands to be showcased in a forum for new model debuts became the impetus to stage the first ever Manila International Motor Show. For this very reason, motoring writers Jason K. Ang, Ulysses K. Ang, and Alvin Uy approached Joseph Ang, Chairman of Worldbex Services International and talked about the idea of holding an international grade and industry-based auto show. Joseph Ang, an events and tradeshow veteran, quickly grasped the idea and announced the holding of the first ever Manila Motor Show held April 2005 as a tribute to his late father, who was in the automotive dealership business before his passing.\n\nIn 2006, the MANILA INTERNATIONAL AUTO SHOW, was presented by the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc.

It is located within the Portland metropolitan area. The area sits between Beaverton and Hillsboro, and is generally considered to be south of U.S. 26, north of Walker Road, west of 158th, and east of Cornelius Pass Road. The area has many shopping areas and is the former home of the defunct Tanasbourne Mall.\n\nIn the 1970s Standard Insurance Company developed a large tract of land along the Sunset Highway near 185th Avenue. The name of the development is a hybrid of the Middle English term \"bourn\" and \"tenas\" from the Chinook Jargon. The latter term translates as small and the former as creek, giving the term tanasbourne the meaning of small, pretty creeks.\n\nStandard developed an indoor mall at the site, with the mall opening in 1975. In 1976, a library was opened in the community, and in 1990 the city of Hillsboro took over those operations and maintained the branch until 2007, when it was closed and a new main branch of the Hillsboro Public Library was opened farther west. In 1983, the county approved a master plan created by Standard to develop at Tanasbourne. Hillsboro annexed much of the Tanasbourne area in 1987. The next year plans were announced for an expansion of the old mall along with construction of new retail buildings in the area. The mall was never expanded.\n\nHillsboro started working to designate the area as a town center within Metro's planning framework in 1996. The Streets of Tanasbourne lifestyle shopping mall opened along Cornell Road in October 2004 after original approval for the project in 2000. Hillsboro is in the process of planning a major redevelopment of the area.\n\nIn 1974, construction began on a $6 million shopping mall to be named Tanasbourne Town Center, located on the east side of Northwest 185th adjacent to the Sunset Highway. This two-story, mall was completed in 1975 by owners Standard Insurance. The original tenants included a library, a day care, professional offices and a three-screen movie theater named Town Center Cinemas. \nA TriMet park-and-ride lot was constructed adjacent to the mall. Tanasbourne Town Center also had an official alternative name of Tanasbourne Mall, which was commonly used by the public.\n\nIn 1988, plans called for developing a shopping area around the mall that would have more than , including the mall. The mall would also be renovated as part of the plan that included Standard selling part of their development, including the mall, to Pacific Rim Development Corporation.\n\nIn 1990, a new outdoor shopping center was opened across 185th Avenue from the indoor mall. Many of the mall's tenants, such as anchors Safeway and PayLess Drug (now Rite Aid), moved to the newer shopping center, creating vacancies in the enclosed mall. The old building was torn down in 1993 and replaced with an outdoor shopping center that includes Target. One of that shopping center's original anchors was a Mervyn's, but it closed in 2006, with the space then divided for use by two smaller stores.\n\nTanasbourne sits at above sea-level. Most of the community is within Hillsboro, and that city maintains a police station in the vicinity. Hillsboro also has several parks in the area including Evergreen Park, Orchard Park, and Magnolia Park. The area is split between the Hillsboro School District and the Beaverton School District.\n\nThe area is a regional shopping hub that includes the Tanasbourne Town Center, Tanasbourne Village, and The Streets of Tanasbourne. Besides shopping centers, Tanasbourne is home to large apartment complexes, industrial/commercial parks, and many medical facilities. Kaiser Permanente opened a new hospital, Kaiser Westside Medical Center, in the community in August 2013. Located in Oregon's Silicon Forest, the area is home to EPSON's Portland operation, a Netflix call center, a loan processing center for Bank of America, and OHSU's West Campus.\n\n", "id": "7721632", "categories": ["Hillsboro, Oregon", "Neighborhoods in Oregon"], "title": "Tanasbourne, Oregon"}

The song was written by Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Glen Ballard, who had signed on to produce \"Nine Lives\". Although he was dropped from the role halfway through production and replaced by Kevin Shirley, Ballard was still credited for his contributions to the album; he also co-wrote \"Pink\" with Tyler and Perry and \"Taste of India\" with Tyler and Richard Supa.\n\nReleased as a single in February 1997, the song topped the Spanish Singles Chart and reached number two in Canada for four weeks. It also topped the UK Rock Chart and the US \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart. Elsewhere, the song peaked at number seven in Finland and reached the top 30 in Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. On the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, it reached number 35, becoming the second highest-charting song from the album on that chart, after \"Pink\".\n\n\"Falling in Love\" was released as the first major single from \"Nine Lives\" in 1997. The song is certainly a rocking number, yet maintains the mainstream appeal found in the former \"Get a Grip\" singles. The horns arrangements were written by lead singer Steven Tyler and David Campbell.\n\nTyler got the inspiration for the title off a bumper sticker he saw a few years previously. The line \"But you like the way I hold the microphone\" was a reference to an almost identical line in The Rolling Stones' 1965 song \"The Spider and the Fly\".\n\nThe song was a popular hit around the world, reaching number 35 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number one on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and in Spain, number two in Canada, number 22 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 46 in Australia.\n\nA music video was produced to promote the single. The video was directed by Michael Bay, and had a surreal landscape described as \"\"12 Monkeys\" meets \"Brazil\"\", which was meant to parody grunge videos. Many supermodels, such as Angie Everhart, are featured dressed as nurses, dominatrices and princesses.\n\nThe video for the song won the band a MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 1997.\n", "id": "7721647", "categories": ["Songs written by Steven Tyler", "1997 singles", "Song recordings produced by Kevin Shirley", "Hard rock songs", "Blues rock songs", "Columbia Records singles", "Music videos directed by Michael Bay", "Songs written by Glen Ballard", "Songs written by Joe Perry (musician)", "Billboard Mainstream Rock number-one singles", "Aerosmith songs"], "title": "Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)"}

However, he is best known as the only umpire to be banned from baseball.\n\nHe was born on July 24, 1851 in Ipswich, England. Higham's family immigrated to the United States when he was two years old, and they settled in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nDuring his career he was a very versatile player, fielding multiples positions, mainly as a right fielder and catcher with notable playing time as a second baseman as well. In , he joined the New York Mutuals of the National Association during its inaugural season and played until the league was dissolved after the 1875 season, serving as player-manager in 1874. He then moved on to the newly formed National League, baseball's first recognized major league, where he hit in the first NL triple play against the Mutuals on May 13, . In , he served as captain of the Syracuse Stars in the inaugural year of the International League, which was part of the League Alliance, with whom the National League had a working relationship.\n\nAfter his playing days were over, he served as an umpire for two years (though rumors abounded that he was fixing games as a player). However, in , William G. Thompson, owner of the Detroit Wolverines (and also mayor of Detroit) got suspicious about some of the calls Higham made against his team. He hired a private detective, who turned up several letters between Higham and a well-known gambler. Higham outlined a simple code—if the gambler received a telegram from him saying \"Buy all the lumber you can\", the gambler was to bet on Detroit. No telegram meant that the gambler was to bet on his opponent.\n\nAs a result of this evidence, Higham was fired as an umpire and banned from baseball. To date, he is the only umpire to have been banished from the game.\n\nHe moved back to Chicago, Illinois and became a bookkeeper.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7721716", "text": "Sândominic\n\nSândominic (, : ) is a commune in Harghita County, Romania. It lies in the Székely Land, an ethno-cultural region in eastern Transylvania. It is composed of a single village, Sândominic.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census, the commune has a population of 6,401, with an absolute Székely Hungarian majority of 6,297 or (98.38%). There are also small minorities of Roma, ethnic Romanians and Germans.\nSândominic is religiously homogeneous, with 98.6% of the population professing Roman Catholicism. Unitarian, Romanian Orthodox, and Hungarian Reformed communities also exist.\n\nThe name \"Sândominic\" is used for most official purposes, but the population usually uses the shortened form \"Domokos\".\n\nSândominic is located in the upper reaches of the Olt valley, 29 kilometres north of Miercurea Ciuc. The mountain pass to the northwest, leading to the village of Izvorul Mureșului () and on to the large town of Gheorgheni, marks the northern boundary of the traditional region of Felcsík.\n\nThe northern reaches of the village follow the descent of the river Olt to the village centre. Within the village limits, the Lok and Szádakút brooks meet the river, which then flows south to the village of Tomeşti. In 1967, the northern village of Bălan, long a part of the commune but by then more populous than the central village, gained official town status and was separated from Sândominic; however, the two settlements still share important economic and transport links.\n\nThe village is served by the \"Izvorul Olt\" station of Romanian State Railways, on the Războieni-Târgu Mureș-Deda-Miercurea Ciuc-Sfântu Gheorghe-Brașov line.\n\nThere is evidence of Székely settlement on the site of Sândominic in the 14th century. In the Middle Ages, the village was the site of iron and copper mining (a tradition carried on until very recently in Bălan.) The name \"Zent Damokos\" appears in a document from 1567. The village gained notoriety for an incident of 3 November 1599 at the field of Pásztorbükk. On this day, Székely irregulars, allied in the Long War with Michael the Brave () against the Hungarian nobility, killed the Cardinal András Báthory, Prince of Transylvania, who was retreating to Poland after being defeated in the Battle of Șelimbăr. The murderers were Mihály András Kristály and Balázs Nagy (later nicknamed Balázs Ördög - 'Balázs the Devil') and they were executed for their deed. Pope Clement VIII responded by placing the whole village under interdict. A Memorial Cross was erected in 1816. Its location is at a distance of 5.5 km north of town, on south-eastern slope of the hill \"Fagul Ciobanului\" (1108 m)\n\nThe village administratively belonged to Csíkszék, then, from 1876 until 1918 to the Csík County of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1920, Sândominic, like the rest of Transylvania, formally passed with the Treaty of Trianon from Hungarian to Romanian control. The region passed again to Hungary with the 1940 Treaty of the Belvedere (also known as the Second Vienna Award). In 1944, the village was the site of particularly bloody reprisals by Romanian irregulars participating in the recapture of Transylvania from this Hungarian control; a small monument in the village's central square bears witness to the 14 victims, among them an 86-year-old woman. After World War II, it came under Romanian administration and became part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, it formed part of the Hungarian Autonomous Province, then, of the Mureș-Hungarian Autonomous Province until it was abolished in 1968. Since then, the commune is part of Harghita County.\n\nSândominic's Roman Catholic church was constructed between 1787 and 1802, and still preserves numerous relics and treasures from the Middle Ages.

It made sports cars in the 1950s.\n\nThe original body produced by Buchanan was a fibreglass item based on an Aston Martin DB3-S racing car. Buchanan borrowed a DB3-S and pulled moulds from it while it was in Australia. The styling was altered by filling in the scallops either side of the bonnet and reshaping the grille opening to be oval. Because the target market was for rebodying of early model MGs, the Buchanan moulds were cut and extended between the door openings and the rear wheelarches, adding several centimetres to the body length.\n\nRacing car kits were also produced, consisting of this type of body plus a fabricated X-frame racing chassis manufactured from steel channel sections welded face to face to form box sections. The chassis used mechanicals from a Holden FJ, with the front suspension crossmember and rear axle assembly being shortened to suit the narrower body.\n\nThe Buchanan Cobra was introduced in 1958 as a production vehicle based on Standard 10 mechanicals. Only 7 were manufactured.\n\nBuchanan Cobra number 1 was known to be sitting in an industrial shed in Warners Bay awaiting restoration as at November 2006.\n\nBuchanan Cobra number 3 is a complete running car and is raced through the Victorian Racing Register on a regular basis in Victoria as of May 2007.

This country is set in Central America, and was created by Australian comedic writers Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro and Rob Sitch (of \"The D-Generation\" and \"The Panel\" fame).\n\nIn Spanish, San Sombrèro would be translated into English as \"Saint Hat\", \"San\" being the shortened word for the Spanish word \"santo\" meaning saint, and \"sombrero\" (no accent mark in real-world Spanish) meaning hat.\n\nAccording to the book the \"full and technically correct\" name of San Sombrèro is the \"Democratic Free People's United Republic of San Sombrèro\", and citizens may be arrested, without a warrant, if the title is \"not\" used.\n\nThe \"Democratic Free People’s United Republic of San Sombrèro\" is a composite of many stereotypes and clichés about Central America and South America. It would be difficult to position the fictional San Sombèro on a map of Central America. Although it is presented as a thin country between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea (similar to Panama), it runs diagonally from northeast to southwest, in comparison to the other states on the Central American strip of land that run more from the northwest to southeast, or west to east. If San Sombrèro were to be geographically placed it would probably fit best between Panama and Costa Rica.\n\nThe book says the nation has \"362 separate public holidays (not including the 'carnivale' long weekend)\". San Sombrèro appears to be a stereotypically corrupt and unstable banana republic with seemingly endless revolutions and counter-revolutions. The country is said to have had 17 different presidents over 10 years.\n\nSan Sombrèro is described as having a very high literacy rate because of an anti-illiteracy campaign in which \"over 53,000 citizens who were unable to read [were] jailed or deported to Haiti\".\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish, San Sombrèro was said to inhabited by several \"Amer-Indian\" ethnic groups, called the \"Ciboney\" (Siboney) (Nomadic hunter-gatherers), \"Taino\" (who lived on seafood), \"Puorcina\" (who practiced simple agriculture) and the most dominant \"Guanajaxo\" (they just stole from everyone else). But there was a tribe that existed before called the \"Bollivquar\", fierce warriors who regarded themselves as a very complex and advanced society, which is said to be odd because they \"never quite\" mastered fire, irrigation or star jumps. But they learnt how to farm tobacco, which to this day still remains a part of the Bollivquar diet, explaining their stunted growth. Note that their inability to light a fire made it harder to take up smoking.\n\nSan Sombrèro is a Spanish-speaking country, but a dialect has developed known as San Sombrèran, which combines Castilian grammar, Portuguese pronunciation, and indigenous shouting. San Sombrèran Spanish is spoken a lot faster than normal Spanish, because it is considered impolite for people to take a breath during a sentence (particularly since their breath is so foul). San Sombrèran Spanish has many English loanwords, some of which are \"beisbol\" - baseball, \"hamburgesa\" - hamburger (these two are actual Spanish words), \"beeras\" - beers, and \"dryvebyshooting\" - drive by shooting.\n\nThe San Sombrèran national anthem is \"O Patria Gloriosa\" (O Glorious Motherland), written in 1853 by independence leader Juan Robirro, who is famous for uttering \"He who loves his country, lives forever\" shortly before falling off a ladder and dying. The national anthem is set to a bossa nova beat, and loyal citizens of San Sombrèro will stand respectfully, place a hand on each hip and start to gyrate while the anthem is played.\n\n\nThe flag of San Sombrèro is the \"Camouflagio\", which resembles military camouflage, with a narrow vertical white stripe on the left side. When the nation first became independent from Spain a dirty red and white chequered tablecloth made an impromptu flag.\n\nThe capital city of San Sombrèro is Cucaracha City in Polluçión. There are five provinces in San Sombrèro including Polluçión, the other provinces are: \n\nThe book advertises (fictional) guides on the following places: Unaudited Arab Emirates (the Middle East), Costa Lottsa (akin to Monaco), the Barbituros Islands (the Caribbean), Alpenstein (the Alps), Tyranistan (Former Soviet Union), Nuku'la Atoll (Polynesia), frozen Norgborg (Scandinavia), and the miserable Isle of Fogg (North Sea). It also advertises its website's forum, as well as world tours for botanists and golfers, and an opportunity to spend a year in an untouched part of Europe.\n\nThe book ends with The Jetlag Story.\n\n", "id": "7721746", "categories": ["Fictional North American countries", "Travel guide books", "2006 books", "Australian books"], "title": "San Sombrèro"}

It is also lengthy, running just over six minutes. The lyrics focus on a heartbroken man who feels very sad and emotionally damaged (\"I got dust for tears and I'm all tapped out\") by a failed relationship (\"tell me how it feels to be the one who turns the knife inside of me\") and feels that there is a void in his life that cannot be filled (\"there's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever\").\n\nIn concert, Steven Tyler has been known to substitute some lines with racier lyrics. On a live version of the song from the \"A Little South of Sanity\" album, Tyler sings \"I fuck with my boots on cause you fuck with my head\" instead of the studio version lyrics \"I sleep with my boots on, but you're still in my head.\"\n\nThe band played the song heavily on their lengthy Nine Lives Tour from 1997–1999, but has almost never played it since.\n\nDirected by Andy Morahan, the video featured a nerdy high school student (played by Branden Williams), often picked on, who is unsuccessful in finding the right girl.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7721860", "text": "Tsumasaburō Bandō\n\nBantsuma, birth name Denkichi Tamura, was born in Kodenmachō, Nihonbashi, Tokyo. Bantsuma's father, a cotton wholesaler named Chōgorō, lived till the age of 71 but his mother, older brother, and sister died when he was young. He attended Jisshi Elementary School (which stands next to the former site of Denma-chō Prison where many the loyal supporters of the Emperor, whom he frequently played in his films, were deeply involved). At school, he was often the leader of the pack and was actively involved in plays. While performing in a school play, Bantsuma froze on stage, unable to recite his lines. Embarrassed, he ran off and stayed in his room, weeping for 10 days. It is said that during this time, he vowed to become someone who would be admired by all.\n\nAfter the death of his mother, his father's business soon went bankrupt and Bantsuma was unable to continue his education. After finishing elementary school, he became an apprentice and pupil to Kataoka Nizaemon, a famous kabuki actor. However, in the world of kabuki, lineage was extremely important and Bantsuma struggled to gain fame. He soon changed his artistic direction by joining small theaters and taking small roles at Kokkatsu production firm. In 1922, with Kichimatsu Nakamura, he formed the “Bando Tsumasaburo Troupe,” but it was disbanded very quickly. In 1923, Bantsuma and Kichimatsu were scouted into the film industry by Makino Film Studio.\n\nOnce he joined Makino Film Productions, he began to build a celebrated career as an actor. It was during this period that he became best friends with Rokuhei Susukita, a script writer who wrote almost a hundred scripts for the Makino studio. He introduced complex plot lines, exhilarating action sequences, and unruly anarchy to jidaigeki films, very much in the style of American films. Rokuhei subsequently selected Bantsuma to debut in his film \"Gyakuryo\" in 1924, a story about a poor, low-rank samurai whose life is turned upside down by his enemy. In 1925, Bantsuma starred in \"Kageboshi\", another screenplay written by Rokuhei, this time depicting the life of the ‘jovial thief’, Kageboshi.\n\nAt the height of his fame, Bantsuma established his own agency in the summer of 1925. It was the first independent production company to be headed by a film star in the history of Japanese cinema. Bantsuma owned most of the rights and would go through the specific scenes and details with the directors. He is said to have been very demanding but his colleagues have explained that this was merely a reflection of his eager and enthusiastic approach to making films. During this time, Bantsuma practically lived in Gion being entertained by geisha. It is also well known that he liked to flaunt his cash and he often treated his co-workers to a night in Gion with sometimes up to 20 geisha in one room. In 1926 Bantsuma built a studio outside Kyoto where the Toei Kyoto studio now stands.\n\nBy far the most controversial film made under Bantsuma Productions was its second production, \"Orochi\" (1925). The story revolves around the protagonist, Heizaburo Kuritomi, an honorable but low-class samurai who is given an emotional depth, previously unseen in jidaigeki films, as he battles with inner conflict and the injustices of society. This is especially evident in the closing sequence of the film where the protagnoist is dragged away by his enemies after his tremendous effort to protect his love. In the essay, \"Bantsuma's 'New Breeze'\", Midori Sawato cites the ending of \"Orochi\" as one of the most 'heroic and heartcrushing' images she has seen. In the past, the heroes of the films were proud samurai of the upper classes who always triumphed over their evil opponents, upholding what was truly right in the world. However, \"Orochi\" was created in response to the national and military fanaticism that was prevailing at the time.\n\nWith its now famous opening lines: ‘Not all those who wear the name of villain, are truly evil men. Not all those who are respected as noble men, are worthy of the name. Many are those who wear a false mask of benevolence to hide their treachery and the wickedness of their true selves,’ the film evoked provocative ideologies and rebellious ideas during a time where liberal performers and writers were being repressed throughout Japan. Consequently, the film was severely censored with over 20% of its content being completely cut out and several scenes having to be re-shot. When the film was finally released, the hype around its creation resulted in crowds flocking to theaters all around the country. Bantsuma's exhilarating new sword fighting style he displayed in the film may have attracted audiences but it cannot be denied that there were many who were also deeply touched by the profound message of the film.\n\nBantsuma went on to produce many films under his production company, but \"Orochi\" was the only one he personally kept the negative for. His agency hit a low point during the period 1931–1935. During this time, his production company was very much a ‘one-man agency’, where the directors were only acting to please Bantsuma. His acting skills gradually became old and outdated so his films did not do very well. In 1935, Bantsuma worked with the renowned director Hiroshi Inagaki in his first talkie film, \"Niino Tsuruchiyo\" (1935), but his rather feeble voice was unpopular with the audience. It seemed that Bantsuma's luck was running out and in 1936 he closed the doors of his agency once and for all, and joined Nikkatsu Production Company in 1937.\n\nBantsuma's films, particularly his earlier works, would not be complete without the fast-paced sword fighting scenes that always guaranteed to raise the heart rate of his audience. Fighting styles had always been set, especially in Kabuki performances and actors were limited to doing standard moves such as the 'Yamagata', 'Yanagi', or the 'Chijihataka'. However, with the emergence of Bantsuma this changed and he introduced a completely new style which was unique to him alone. Ryu Kuze, a sword fighting coach analyzed Bantsuma's technique and put his uniqueness down to the fact that he does not look at his victims when he slays them. Instead, he is already focused on his next victim. Ryu Kuze also pointed out that Bantsuma would stand straight with his ankles lined up which was his signature pose that signaled death for his opponent. His colleagues often spoke of their admiration for Bantsuma's enthusiasm and quick ability to pick up new moves and sequences. Bantsuma's spectacular sword skills soon earned him the title, ‘The King of Swordfights.’\n\nBantsuma's first son, Takahiro Tamura, described his father as ‘sensitive’ and affected by everything occurring around him. He wrote several articles for magazines such as \"Bantsuma Cinema News\" and displayed his sensitivity, as well as giving the audience an insight into his mentality.\n\nIn the November 1929 issue of \"Bantsuma Cinema News\", he wrote, ‘The life of an artist is to die for art. Only when art is one’s life can one produce real art. As I have a long way to go, I will continue down this path while with such belief.’\n\nHis determination and dedication in what he did is evident in the statement he made in the February 1930 issue of the same magazine. He wrote, ‘When creating such a film, I am not an actor, but actually am in the shoes of the character in the film, feeling what he feels, and I suffer the same agony as that character. I must play numerous characters and their diverse personalities one after another. I am no God. Sometimes I feel myself screaming inside…you cannot claim with confidence that you are speaking the mind of the character with only a half-developed understanding of that character. Being able to fully depict the character comes only after bleeding and suffering in agony in the process.’\n\nBantsuma was truly a man of many talents.\n\nBantsuma and his wife Shizuko Tamura had four sons together — Takahiro Tamura, Masakazu Tamura, Ryō Tamura, and Toshima Tamura. Three followed in their father's footsteps, launching careers in the movie industry. Toshima became a businessperson.\n\nHis first son, Takahiro Tamura (who died on 16 May 2006 from a cerebral infarction), often spoke fondly about his father in interviews and gave valuable insights.\n\nThe family often spent their summers at the beach in Amanohashidate and, as Takahiro recalled, Bantsuma would splash around in the water, even more excited than his brothers. He also spoke of the memory of his father's reaction to the results of his junior high school examination. Too nervous to go to the school and check, the good news was delivered by the teacher. Takahiro distinctly remembered his father bounding down the stairs and bowing in front of the teacher till his forehead touched the floor, almost as if shooting a scene from one of his jidaigeki films.\n\nMany people think that Bantsuma's true nature can be seen in \"Yabure Daiko\" (1949), where he plays the role of a tyrannical man feared by his family. He was the complete opposite, always putting his family first. The role he played in \"Abare Jishi\" of a father who would do anything for his children is a more accurate representation of Bantsuma, who was an affectionate and well-rounded family man. However, Bantsuma's dedication to his work was also strong, and he returned to the set, ready to work, the day after his wedding.\n\nIt seems that Bantsuma's sensitivity was beginning to make its way into the work he was producing. A year after entering Nikkatsu, Bantsuma co-starred with Kataoka Chiezo in the all-star film, \"Chushingura\" (1938). Playing the role of Kuranosuke Oishi, Bantsuma displayed his perfected acting skills with his powerful performance. Then in 1943 he starred in the film \"Muho matsu no Issho\", playing a poor rickshaw man. It was a role that would not normally have been taken on by such a great star but director Hiroshi Inagaki, whom Bantsuma had previously worked with, was determined to get him on board. After initially turning down the role, Bantsuma finally agreed and went on to play a role with a profound humanistic approach that lent great depth to both the character and the movie. In preparation for the role of the poor rickshaw man, Bantsuma stayed in character even whilst at home. His first son, Takahiro Tamura described watching his father eat dried fish and drink sake in the style of the character of the film.\n\nDuring this period of his career, Japan soon lost the war and the US army began to restrict Jidaigeki as a ‘hotbed of feudalism.’ Thus, the stars of Jidaigeki formed troupes and traveled around the country. During this time, Bantsuma perfected his skills further and in 1948 he peaked once again with his performance in the film \"Ōshō\". Director Daisuke Itō spoke of Bantsuma's wide range and depth, his convincing and humanistic portrayal of the protagonist, and stated that despite his big status in the film industry, Bantsuma was the obvious choice for the part of Sankichi, a man of the lowest social ranks.\n\nOn 7 July 1953, Bantsuma died at the age of 51 of cerebral hemorrhage while filming \"Abare-Jishi\".

For example, the use of curling irons and other heat treatments may cause split ends. Excessive application of hair products such as perms and hair coloring may strip protective layering off the outside of the hair's shaft and weaken the hair, making the hair prone to split ends. Mechanical stresses include pulling a comb forcefully through tangled hair and repeated combing. Split ends can be seen as a symptom of copper transport disorders such as Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome. Rubbing the hair up towards the scalp does not cause split ends.\nThere is no remedy for split ends beyond trimming the affected hair.\n\nSome products claim to heal split ends by sealing the ends back together.\n\nReducing or eliminating the causes will usually prevent split ends.

It is formulated in combination with a progestin and is not available alone. It is taken by mouth.\nSide effects of mestranol include nausea, breast tension, edema, and breakthrough bleeding among others. It is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. Mestranol is a prodrug of ethinylestradiol in the body.\nMestranol was discovered in 1956 and was introduced for medical use in 1957. It was the estrogen component in the first birth control pill. In 1969, mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most birth control pills, although mestranol continues to be used in a few birth control pills even today. Mestranol remains available only in a few countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Chile.\n\nMestranol was employed as the estrogen component in many of the first oral contraceptives, such as mestranol/noretynodrel (brand name \"Enovid\") and mestranol/norethisterone (brand names \"Ortho-Novum\", \"Norinyl\"), and is still in use today. In addition to its use as an oral contraceptive, mestranol has been used as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.\n\nMestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver with a conversion efficiency of 70% (50 µg of mestranol is pharmacokinetically bioequivalent to 35 µg of ethinylestradiol, or ethinylestradiol being about 1.7 times as orally potent by weight as mestranol). It has been found to possess 0.1 to 2.3% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol (100%) for the estrogen receptor, compared to 75 to 190% for ethinylestradiol.\n\nThe elimination half-life of mestranol has been reported to be 50 minutes. The elimination half-life of the active form of mestranol, ethinylestradiol, is 7 to 36 hours.\n\nThe effective ovulation-inhibiting dosage of mestranol has been studied.\n\nMestranol, also known as ethinylestradiol 3-methyl ether (EEME) or as 17α-ethynyl-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17β-ol, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is specifically a derivative of ethinylestradiol (17α-ethynylestradiol) with a methyl ether at the C3 position.\n\nIn April 1956, noretynodrel was investigated, in Puerto Rico, in the first large-scale clinical trial of a progestogen as an oral contraceptive. The trial was conducted in Puerto Rico due to the high birth rate in the country and concerns of moral censure in the United States. It was discovered early into the study that the initial chemical syntheses of noretynodrel had been contaminated with small amounts (1–2%) of the 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol (noretynodrel having been synthesized from ethinylestradiol). When this impurity was removed, higher rates of breakthrough bleeding occurred. As a result, mestranol, that same year (1956), was developed and serendipitously identified as a very potent synthetic estrogen (and eventually as a prodrug of ethinylestradiol), given its name, and added back to the formulation. This resulted in Enovid by G. D. Searle & Company, the first oral contraceptive and a combination of 9.85 mg noretynodrel and 150 μg mestranol per pill.\n\nAround 1969, mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most combined oral contraceptives due to widespread panic about the recently uncovered increased risk of venous thromboembolism with estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. The rationale was that ethinylestradiol was approximately twice as potent by weight as mestranol and hence that the dose could be halved, which it was thought might result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism. Whether this actually did result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism has never been assessed.\n\n\"Mestranol\" is the generic name of the drug and its , , , , , and , while \"mestranolo\" is its .\n\nMestranol has been marketed under a variety of brand names, mostly or exclusively in combination with progestins, including Devocin, Enavid, Enovid, Femigen, Mestranol, Norbiogest, Ortho-Novin, Ortho-Novum, Ovastol, and Tranel among others. Today, it continues to be sold in combination with progestins under brand names including Lutedion, Necon, Norinyl, Ortho-Novum, and Sophia.\n\nMestranol remains available only in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Chile. It is only marketed in combination with progestins, such as norethisterone.\n\nMestranol has been studied as a male contraceptive and was found to be highly effective. At a dosage of 0.45 mg/day, it suppressed gonadotropin levels, reduced sperm count to zero within 4 to 6 weeks, and decreased libido, erectile function, and testicular size. Gynecomastia occurred in all of the men. These findings contributed to the conclusion that estrogens would be unacceptable as contraceptives for men.\n", "id": "7721911", "categories": ["Alkyne derivatives", "Estrogen ethers", "Diols", "Prodrugs", "Estranes", "Hormonal contraception"], "title": "Mestranol"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7721922", "text": "Pataria\n\nThe pataria was an eleventh-century religious movement in the Archdiocese of Milan in northern Italy, aimed at reforming the clergy and ecclesiastic government in the province and supportive of Papal sanctions against simony and clerical marriage. Those involved in the movement were called patarini (also patarines or patarenes, from singular \"patarino\"), a word chosen by their opponents, which means \"ragpickers\", from Milanese \"patee\" \"rags\". In general the \"patarini\" were tradesmen motivated by personal piety. The conflict between the \"patarini\" and their supporters and the partisans of the simoniacal archbishops eventually led to civil war by the mid-1070s, the Great Saxon revolt. It received its most dependable contemporary chronicler in Arnulf of Milan.\n\nThe \"pataria\" was partially the result of church reform movements like the Peace and Truce of God and partially of the social situation in Milan. The influence of southern French movements, such as the Peace and Truce, affected the \"pataria\". The subsequent popularity of the Cathar movement in Milan during the twelfth century was resultant of the \"pataria\". The chief targets of the \"patarini\" were the rich, secular, aristocratic landowners and the simoniacal and nicolaitan clergy. They contested the ancient rights of the cathedral clergy of Milan and supported the Gregorian reforms. They joined with the lesser clergy in opposition to the practices of simony and of clerical marriage and concubinage. The morals of the clergy were attacked, too, as was monastic discipline. The contrast between the impoverished lesser clergy and the magnates of the Church resurfaced as a point of contention.\n\nThe archbishop Guido da Velate was a particular victim of the \"patarini\". On the death in 1045 of the warrior and prince-bishop Ariberto da Intimiano, the Milanese requested the Emperor Henry III, who controlled the election of bishops in his realms, to choose from among four candidates deemed \"retti ed onesti\" (upright and honest): Anselmo da Baggio, Arialdo da Carimate, Landolfo Cotta, and Attone. The Emperor's choice, however, fell upon the thoroughly worldly Guido, known for his support of the practice of clerical marriage and concubinage, which was generally accepted in rural areas and which was now being given the name \"nicolaism\", recalling a passage in the \"Book of Revelation\" (2:6, 14–15).\n\nGuido, however, did not fulfill his vows to fight simony and was forced to resign. The \"patarini\" initially protested the abuse by their refusal to accept communion at the hands of priests with unofficial wives or concubines. Some churches were emptied while others were packed with the faithful. The movement formed behind its leaders, the four rejected \"upright and honest\" priests. To defuse the situation the emperor named Anselmo da Baggio bishop of Lucca, which carried him securely away from Milan, and the archbishop excommunicated the intractable Arialdo da Carimate and Landolfo Cotta.\n\nFollowing the pontificate of Benedict IX, the papacy too began to sense the urgency of reform and Pope Leo IX condemned both the practice of simony and concubinage among priests. When Landolfo Cotta attempted to present the position of the Milanese \"patarini\" before Pope Stephen IX, the archbishop's ruffians caught up with him at Piacenza and came near to killing him. A second attack in 1061 was successful. In 1060 Pope Nicholas II sent a delegation to Milan under the direction of Peter Damiani and Anselmo da Baggio, and calm was restored to the city.\n\nAfter Landolfo's death, his brother Erlembald stepped in to take his place. He transferred the movement from one primarily socioreligious to principally military. The \"pataria\" at this moment received the support of Popes Alexander II and Gregory VII while the Ambrosian see fell into schism and war until the archiepiscopate of Anselm III reestablished order.\n\nThe Occitan word \"pataric\" later became a synonym for Cathar. The wife of the troubadour Raimon Jordan was a reported \"pataric\". There were also rumours, emanating from a Christian prisoner in Alexandria, that the Patarenes had made an alliance with the Muslims against the Crusaders. These rumours captivated Joachim of Fiore, who built on it an apocalyptic theory of the union of the \"beast from the sea\" and the \"beast from the land\".\n\n", "id": "7721922", "categories": ["11th century in Italy", "History of Milan"], "title": "Pataria"}

These stand in relation to the conventional \"elliptic\" modular forms as abelian varieties do in relation to elliptic curves; the complex manifolds constructed as in the theory are basic models for what a moduli space for abelian varieties (with some extra level structure) should be, as quotients of the Siegel upper half-space rather than the upper half-plane by discrete groups.\n\nThe modular forms of the theory are holomorphic functions on the set of symmetric \"n\" × \"n\" matrices with positive definite imaginary part; the forms must satisfy an automorphy condition. Siegel modular forms can be thought of as multivariable modular forms, i.e. as special functions of several complex variables.\n\nSiegel modular forms were first investigated by for the purpose of studying quadratic forms analytically. These primarily arise in various branches of number theory, such as arithmetic geometry and elliptic cohomology. Siegel modular forms have also been used in some areas of physics, such as conformal field theory.\n\nLet formula_1 and define\n\nthe Siegel upper half-space. Define the symplectic group of level formula_3, denoted by formula_4 as \n\nwhere formula_6 is the formula_7 identity matrix.

The ring of such forms is a polynomial ring C[\"E\",\"E\"] in the (degree 1) Eisenstein series \"E\" and \"E\".\n\nFor degree 2, showed that the ring of level 1 Siegel modular forms is generated by the (degree 2) Eisenstein series \"E\" and \"E\" and 3 more forms of weights 10, 12, and 35. The ideal of relations between them is generated by the square of the weight 35 form minus a certain polynomial in the others.\n\nFor degree 3, described the ring of level 1 Siegel modular forms, giving a set of 34 generators.\nFor degree 4, the level 1 Siegel modular forms of small weights have been found. There are no cusp forms of weights 2, 4, or 6. The space of cusp forms of weight 8 is 1-dimensional, spanned by the Schottky form. The space of cusp forms of weight 10 has dimension 1, the space of cusp forms of weight 12 has dimension 2, the space of cusp forms of weight 14 has dimension 3, and the space of cusp forms of weight 16 has dimension 7 .\n\nFor degree 5, the space of cusp forms has dimension 0 for weight 10, dimension 2 for weight 12. The space of forms of weight 12 has dimension 5.\n\nFor degree 6, there are no cusp forms of weights 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. The space of Siegel modular forms of weight 2 has dimension 0, and those of weights 4 or 6 both have dimension 1.\n\nFor small weights and level 1, give the following results (for any positive degree):\n\nThe following table combines the results above with information from and and .\n\nThe theorem known as the \"Koecher principle\" states that if formula_20 is a Siegel modular form of weight formula_15, level 1, and degree formula_21, then formula_20 is bounded on subsets of formula_30 of the form \n\nwhere formula_32.

It was written by Steven Tyler and professional songwriters Richie Supa and Glen Ballard. It was released as the third major single from \"Nine Lives\" in 1997.\n\nThe song reached No. 27 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, No. 38 in the United Kingdom, and No. 19 in Latvia. It also topped the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks.\n\nThe band re-released the song in the United Kingdom in 1999. The re-released version did much better, reaching No. 13.\n\nThe song is highlighted by a harmonica performance by Steven Tyler at the beginning, as well as a strong bass rhythm throughout the song, and a mix of acoustic guitars and jangling electric guitars throughout the verses.\n\nMany of the lines in the verses start with the word \"pink\" (e.g. \"Pink it's my new obsession \", \"Pink it's not even a question\", \"Pink on the lips of your lover\"). The song is also highly suggestive, in that the origin of the fascination with pink stems from the admiration of a woman's reproductive organs, particularly the inner side of the outer lips – the \"pink in the middle\" – and also the man's penis – \"I wanna wrap you in rubber\" and \"my favorite crayon\".\n\nThe music video for the song used CGI to morph characters' faces to other bodies. A variety of random characters mixed in with band members moving towards the camera, morphing into different characters in the process (e.g., Joe Perry as a centaur, Brad Whitford as a little boy, Steven Tyler as a skeleton, and a boy dressed as the Easter Bunny). It was directed by Doug Nichol.\n\nTwo versions of the music video exist. In the uncensored version, there is a woman dressed in a blue jumpsuit walking towards the camera. For a brief second, the top, unzipped portion of the jumpsuit is pulled away, revealing her right breast. There is another instance where a woman's breasts are briefly fully revealed when a woman, painted blue and green, does a pirouette.\n\nThe uncensored version caused minor controversy and MTV asked Nichol to censor the video for daytime airings. As a result, the edited version censored the pirouette scene. The clean version also shows Tyler and Perry presented as a two-headed man and only the coverup portion of the breast reveal scene is present.\n\nThe 1997 release cover art had the Aerosmith logo drawn as if it were by a child, in a pink background. In the 1999 re-release, the cover art features the Aerosmith logo and eight stills from the music video.\n\nAs of 2007, \"Pink\" is one of only two songs from \"Nine Lives\" consistently played on Aerosmith tours, along with \"Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)\".\n\nA different version of the song, The South Beach Re-Mix, was included on the career-spanning compilation \"O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits\".\n\nJapanese edition of the \"Pink\" single from 'Nine Lives' features six tracks: three mixes of \"Pink\" (Album Version, The South Beach Mix & Live from the Howard Stern Radio Show), plus live versions of \"Falling In Love (Is Hard On The Knees)\" & \"Walk This Way\" recorded in March 1997. As well, there is a techno remix of \"Falling in Love (Is Hard On The Knees)\" titled Moby Fucked Remix.\n\nIt is a bonus playable song in the video game \"\", and the only track from \"Nine Lives\" present in the game. In the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions of this game, the word \"high\" (in \"Pink gets me high as a kite\") is removed.\n\nThe song won the band their fourth and most recent Grammy award in 1999 for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\n\nAdditionally, the video won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 1998.\n", "id": "7721939", "categories": ["Songs written by Steven Tyler", "1997 singles", "Song recordings produced by Kevin Shirley", "Columbia Records singles", "1996 songs", "Aerosmith songs", "Songs written by Glen Ballard", "Billboard Mainstream Rock number-one singles", "Songs written by Richard Supa"], "title": "Pink (song)"}

She was the first female executive editor in the paper's 160-year history. Abramson joined the \"New York Times\" in 1997, working as the Washington bureau chief and managing editor before being named as executive editor. She previously worked for \"The Wall Street Journal\" as an investigative reporter and a deputy bureau chief. \n\nIn March 2016, she was hired as a political columnist for \"Guardian US\". In 2019, she received widespread criticism from journalists after her book \"Merchants Of Truth\" was found to contain plagiarized passages and numerous factual errors, though Abramson's book was praised for its accuracy by Donald Trump.\n\nIn 2012, she was ranked number five on \"Forbes\" list of most powerful women. She was also named as one of the 500 most powerful people in the world by \"Foreign Policy\".\nAbramson was born in New York City and grew up in a Jewish home. She received her high school diploma from Ethical Culture Fieldston School and a BA in History and Literature from Harvard University and Radcliffe College in 1976.\n\nWhile a Harvard undergraduate, she was the Arts Editor of \"The Harvard Independent\", and worked at \"Time\" magazine from 1973 to 1976. Subsequently, she spent nearly a decade as a senior staff reporter for \"The American Lawyer\". In 1986, she was appointed as editor in chief of \"Legal Times\" in Washington, D.C., serving for two years. From 1988 to 1997, she was a senior reporter in the Washington bureau of \"The Wall Street Journal\", eventually rising to deputy bureau chief. She joined \"The New York Times\" in 1997, becoming its Washington bureau chief in December 2000.\n\nAbramson was the \"Times\"' Washington Bureau chief during the turbulent period of Spring 2003 during the run-up to the war in Iraq and the Jayson Blair scandal, which led to the resignation of Executive Editor Howell Raines and Managing Editor Gerald Boyd. In a February 2013 interview, Abramson spoke of the conflict she had with Raines as D.C. bureau chief, saying, \"Howell from the get-go just had no use for me. ... I did think about quitting.\" Abramson was named to the news managing editor position (with co-Managing Editor John M. Geddes) by Raines' successor Bill Keller.\n\nIn 1995, Abramson and her \"The Wall Street Journal\" colleague (and fellow Fieldston alumna) Jane Mayer co-authored \"Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas\", which detailed circumstances surrounding the confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas. Maureen Dowd would later write of having bonded with Abramson during that time. From 2000 to 2001, she was a professor at Princeton University. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001.\n\nIn February 2007, Abramson testified in the perjury trial of Scooter Libby, \"United States v. Libby\". She was called as a defense witness to undercut the credibility of Judith Miller.\n\nIn 2010, it was announced that Abramson was going to work on news content on the \"Times\" website for six months.\n\nOn June 2, 2011, it was announced that Abramson would become the executive editor of the \"Times\" in September 2011, replacing Bill Keller who would step down from the position to become a full-time writer.\n\nAbramson was scheduled to address the commencement exercises of Barnard College on May 14, 2012. Her speech was canceled after President Barack Obama requested to speak instead. She received an honorary degree at Fairleigh Dickinson's 69th Commencement Ceremony in May 2012.\n\nIn April 2013, Abramson was the subject of a sharply critical profile in \"Politico\" written by Dylan Byers entitled \"Turbulence at the Times,\" in which anonymous \"Times\" staffers called her \"impossible\" and \"very, very unpopular.\" Abramson was deeply distressed by the report, later saying it made her cry.\n\nOn May 14, 2014, it was announced that Abramson had been fired from her position as executive editor of the \"Times\", and that Dean Baquet would succeed her in that role. Abramson was reportedly fired because of \"her arbitrary decision-making, a failure to consult and bring colleagues with her, inadequate communication, and mistreatment of colleagues\". Five days later, she delivered the commencement address at Wake Forest University. \n\nDuring the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Abramson argued in a column for \"Guardian US\" that Hillary Clinton, whom she had covered as a reporter and editor since the Whitewater controversy, was \"fundamentally honest and trustworthy.\"\n\nOn February 19, 2018, Abramson followed up her 1995 book on Clarence Thomas and the Anita Hill hearings with a discussion concerning new evidence that Thomas had committed perjury which might be tied to possible impeachment. Abramson indicated that her reporting was initiated by an article by the journalist Marcia Coyle from 2016 when Abramson stated, \"Tipped to the post by a Maryland legal source who knew Smith (who made the allegations), Marcia Coyle, a highly regarded and scrupulously nonideological Supreme Court reporter for \"The National Law Journal\", wrote a detailed story about (Moira) Smith’s allegation of butt-squeezing, which included corroboration from Smith’s roommates at the time of the dinner and from her former husband. Coyle’s story, which Thomas denied, was published October 27, 2016\".\nIn December 2018, Fox News reported that Abramson's book \"Merchants of Truth\" criticized her former employer the \"Times\" of abandoning objectivity and becoming \"anti-Trump\" to bolster profits. Abramson responded by stating that the \"Fox News\" review \"distorts and takes what I wrote totally out of context\" and praised the \"Times\" along with \"The Washington Post\" for their \"superb coverage of the corruption enveloping the Trump administration, the best investigative reporting I’ve seen.\"\n\nIn February 2019, Vice News correspondent Michael C. Moynihan said Abramson's book \"Merchants of Truth\" contained several instances of plagiarism, posting a series of tweets comparing passages of the book to passages of other publications, including \"Time Out\", \"The Ryerson Review of Journalism\", \"The New Yorker\", \"The Columbia Journalism Review\", and other works. In a February 7 interview on Fox News, Abramson said she had no comment on the plagiarism accusations, but later that evening said she would review the passages in question. However, in an interview with NPR's Michel Martin, Abramson admitted that she \"fell short\" in attributing her sources for some passages of the book. In an interview with CNN's Brian Stelter, Abramson said that most of the plagiarized text was cited in footnotes, but that was she was sorry that a few piece of text were not. Stelter pointed out to Abramson that lifting words from other sources and citing footnotes is still considered plagiarism.\n\nIn 1981, she married Harvard classmate Henry Little Griggs III. Griggs was then president of Triad, a political public relations company. He is self-described as a \"writer, editor and media-relations consultant specializing in nonprofit advocacy campaigns.\" They have two children.\n\nIn May 2007, Abramson was seriously injured in a truck-pedestrian crash near the \"New York Times\" headquarters in Times Square. She subsequently filed a lawsuit against the truck's driver, owner, and operator, who was involved in the crash, as well two companies involved in the crash.\n\nAbramson has four tattoos on her body that she describes as \"telling the story of me.\" They include a New York City Subway token; the letter \"H,\" representing her alma mater, Harvard University, and her husband, Henry; and the letter \"T\" in the Gothic font of the \"New York Times\" logo. Abramson first unveiled her \"New York Times\" tattoo on a New York interview show less than a month before being fired from the paper, saying that it, along with the 'H' tattoo represent \"the two institutions that I revere, that have shaped me.\" She has called her \"Times\" tattoo, which is emblazoned on her back, her \"personal hieroglyphic.\" However, although she worked at \"The Wall Street Journal\" for 10 years, she elected not be similarly marked by that newspaper because \"It just wasn't in my family's blood.\"\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n", "id": "7721960", "categories": [" Plagiarism", "Jewish American writers", "American newspaper reporters and correspondents", " Journalistic scandals", "Ethical Culture Fieldston School alumni", "The Wall Street Journal people", "Journalists from Washington, D.C.", "The New York Times masthead editors", "1954 births", "Living people", "American women writers", "Jewish American journalists", "Princeton University faculty", "American women journalists", "Writers from New York City", " Fabulists", "Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences"], "title": "Jill Abramson"}

The film originally premiered as a presentation of \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\" on NBC on November 17, 1976.\n\nBased on true events, the film attempts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Aimee Semple McPherson in 1926 and the court case that followed her safe return after being missing for four weeks.\n\n\nIn her memoir \"This 'n That\" (1987, Berkley Pub Group), Bette Davis recounted several anecdotes about working on \"The Disappearance of Aimee\". Among them was that her co-star, Faye Dunaway, was one of the most unprofessional people she had ever worked with. Davis stated that Dunaway would show up hours late, not knowing her lines, and being generally difficult. For one of the scenes in the un-air-conditioned tabernacle, over 1800 unpaid extras (locals who had been promised a box lunch and a chance to be in a movie) were left for hours awaiting Dunaway's arrival. When they finally began leaving, Davis rushed to the pulpit and began singing \"I've Written a Letter to Daddy,\" a song from her wildly popular 1962 film \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\".

The team currently campaigns three Ford Mustangs, driven by Lee Holdsworth, Cameron Waters and Chaz Mostert. Mark Winterbottom won the 2015 championship driving for the team. Tickford Racing also competes in the Dunlop Super2 Series with Thomas Randle and operates the 23Red Racing Mustang of Will Davison.\n\nIn December 2002, Prodrive purchased Glenn Seton Racing, and renamed it Ford Performance Racing as part of a marketing push to link the Prodrive-owned Ford Performance Vehicles road car range to the popular V8 Supercars. Along with this renaming came a huge expansion programme – the team expanded from one car driven by Glenn Seton to three; Seton, Craig Lowndes and David Besnard. The team moved into a new headquarters adjacent to the FPV factory in Campbellfield, Melbourne, and the crew expanded as well. The third car was entered using Rod Nash Racing's Racing Entitlement Contract (REC). While other teams such had received major Ford support in the years since, it became the first official Ford factory team since the Ford Works Team of 1962 to 1973.\n\nThe team's early years were somewhat disappointing, given the fact the team was one of the best funded in V8 Supercars. Lowndes had his moments in 2003, including a round win at Phillip Island, and a second-place finish at Bathurst driving with Seton. Lowndes finished the year 5th in the championship, with Seton and Besnard well down the order. In 2004, the team downsized to two cars. Lowndes and Seton both had disappointing years, plagued by engine dramas, a lack of test days, and a lack of comparable data (their cars were built to different specifications). While the pair did start to find some pace at the end of the year (they finished second at Bathurst again), they both decided to move at the end of the year – Lowndes to Triple Eight Race Engineering and Seton to Dick Johnson Racing.\n\nJason Bright and Greg Ritter joined for the 2005 season. Bright had a consistent year, and finished inside the top 10, while Ritter was disappointing, David Brabham replaced him for the final two rounds. In 2006, Mark Winterbottom joined the team. Bright scored multiple front-row starts, including three pole positions. He won the inaugural round in Bahrain, the Desert 400, and came 6th in the championship. Winterbottom enjoyed a very consistent run to finish third in the championship. The pair won the Sandown 500. FPR came second in the team's championship behind the HSV Dealer Team.\n\nBright left FPR at the end of the 2006 season to drive for his own Britek Motorsport outfit, with Steven Richards recruited to replace him. The team continued to take the challenge to the front-running teams. The most disappointing moment in 2007 was when Winterbottom left the circuit late in the race while leading at Bathurst. In 2008 Winterbottom challenged for the championship, but Jamie Whincup managed to finish the championship ahead of Winterbottom while Richards finished 8th.\n\nIn 2009, the new FG Falcon was debuted. While Triple Eight already had the speed, FPR struggled with only one win from Mark Winterbottom during the season with Steven Richards finishing a best of 3rd. The team also struggled at Bathurst again with the No. 6 car driven by Winterbottom and Richards caught fire on lap 50 while the second car driven by Dean Canto and Luke Youlden crashed late in the race. Mark Winterbottom and Steven Richards finished 5th and 13th in the championship.\n\nIn 2010, Winterbottom finished 3rd and Richards 15th. For 2011, Will Davison replaced Richards, who was retained as an endurance co-driver for Winterbottom. Winterbottom finished in 3rd place for the championship while Davison finished in 7th. In 2012, FPR were strong challengers for the championship, Winterbottom finishing 3rd with Davison finishing 4th.\n\nIn January 2013, the team was sold by Prodrive to Rusty French and Rod Nash. In the 2013 season, Mark Winterbottom and Steven Richards won the Bathurst 1000. Davison finished the season in third, Winterbottom fourth. Chaz Mostert joined the team in 2014, replacing Will Davison. FPR won the 2014 Bathurst 1000 with Mostert partnered by Paul Morris.\n\nIn 2015, Ford Performance Racing was renamed as Prodrive Racing Australia, as a result of Ford's decision to progressively withdraw its V8 Supercars support by 2016. The team introduced the Ford FG X Falcon, the first new Falcon since 2009. After a slow start, the team achieved considerable success in the next section of the season, with eleven out of fifteen race wins between the third event (the Perth Super Sprint) and the eighth event (the Sydney Motorsport Park Super Sprint). Winterbottom, co-driving with Steve Owen, then went on to win the 2015 Wilson Security Sandown 500, leading home a team one-two with Mostert and Cameron Waters in second. It was the team's first win at the event since 2006. At the 2015 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000, Mostert had a substantial crash in Friday qualifying, ruling his car out for the weekend and himself out for the rest of the season. This left Winterbottom with a large championship lead entering the final rounds, and while he didn't win another race after Sandown, Winterbottom held on to win his, and the team's first drivers' championship. The team was leading the teams' championship until the final round, in which it was overtaken by long-time rivals Triple Eight. \n\nIn 2016, Mostert was moved to customer team Rod Nash Racing for sponsorship purposes, with Cameron Waters joining the team full-time in car No. 6 alongside defending champion Winterbottom. The team only won 2 races, both with Winterbottom who finished the championship in 6th place. Waters finished his first season in 19th, with his best finish being 4th place at the Bathurst 1000 with Jack Le Brocq. In 2017 the team continued with the same driver lineup, with its only race win being the Sandown 500 with Waters and co-driver Richie Stanaway. Winterbottom finished the championship in 6th, while Waters finished in 8th place.\n\nIn 2018, the team was rebranded as Tickford Racing, with Stanaway joining the team in car No. 56. The Rod Nash Racing REC was moved to the team with Mostert, officially making Tickford Racing a 4 car team.\n\nFrom 2010-2017, the team has prepared a customer car for Rod Nash Racing. Paul Dumbrell drove in 2010 and 2011 before David Reynolds took over in 2012, with notable results being a race win at the 2013 Armor All Gold Coast 600, a second place at the 2012 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 and 3rd in the driver's championship in 2015, with Dean Canto as his co-driver. From 2016, Chaz Mostert raced with Rod Nash Racing, winning 3 races and the Pirtek Enduro Cup the following season with Steve Owen. The Rod Nash Racing REC is now run under the Tickford Racing name with Mostert and Owen.\n\nIn 2013, the team took on a second customer car for Charlie Schwerkolt Racing. The Schwerkolt entry was driven by Alex Davison in 2013, with Jack Perkins replacing Davison for 2014. Schwerkolt and his team split with Prodrive prior to the 2015 season, moving to Walkinshaw Racing for 2015.\n\nSuper Black Racing replaced the No. 18 Schwerkolt entry for 2015, with Andre Heimgartner the driver of Car No. 111. Chris Pither replaced Heimgartner for the final two rounds of the 2015 season and continued with the team for 2016. After the 2016 season, the team sold its Racing Entitlement Contract to Tim Blanchard Racing.\n\nIn 2017, Britek Motorsport replaced Super Black Racing as the team's second customer entry. Team owner Jason Bright drove the team's No. 56 entry with Garry Jacobson co-driving. After 2017, Bright retired from full-time driving and the REC was leased to Matt Stone Racing.\n\nAfter running its first Supercars season on its own, 23Red Racing became a satellite operation for 2019 with Tickford re-building the teams Ford Falcon into a Ford Mustang for the 2019 season. Former Ford Performance Racing driver Will Davison races 23Red's Mustang.\n\nTickford Racing has run a number of customer cars for other franchise holders, the first in 2007 where the No. 021 Team Kiwi Racing BF Falcon driven by Paul Radisich was prepared for the first few rounds of the season. In 2008, FPR prepared the No. 777 Ford Rising Stars Racing BF Falcon of Michael Patrizi. For the 2015 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000, the team ran a third customer car, a wildcard entry for Renee Gracie and Simona de Silvestro known as the \"Harvey Norman Super Girls\".\n\nThe team has also run entries in the second-tier Dunlop Super2 Series in recent years. The first of these was in 2010 when the team ran James Moffat in a BF Falcon. This was followed by entering Chaz Mostert in 2011 and 2012 using an FG Falcon. In 2014 and 2015, the team ran Cameron Waters in an older generation (pre-2013) FG Falcon in the Development Series, winning the championship in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, the team expanded to two (2015-spec) FG X Falcon entries for Garry Jacobson and Jack Le Brocq. The pairing finished first and second in the championship respectively. In 2017, the team continued to run FG X Falcons, for defending champion Jacobson and Josh Kean. They also ran a wildcard entry at the Sydney round with Richie Stanaway, who achieved two 3rd place finishes and a race win in the 4 races held. Jacobson finished the championship in 6th position while Kean finished in 19th. For 2018 the team will only field one FG X Falcon for Thomas Randle.\n\nThe following is a list of drivers who have driven for the team in the Supercars Championship, in order of their first appearance.

Located in the extreme northwestern corner of the state on the Canada–United States border, it was an important border-crossing location going back to the days of ox roads and later was one of the busiest ports of entry west of the Great Lakes for rail and road traffic. The town of Emerson, Manitoba is directly north of Noyes on the Canadian side of the border.\n\nNoyes is the northern terminus of U.S. Highway 75 and the site where the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe and Soo Line Railroads enter Canada. Since the construction of Interstate 29 on the North Dakota side of the nearby Red River, U.S. Highway 75 has declined in importance. The Canadian government closed Emerson port of entry opposite Noyes in 2003, while the Port of Noyes closed in 2006, leaving the U.S. 75 from the south the only access to Noyes. Travelers must now use the border crossing located less than two miles to the west, but a seven-mile trek from Noyes, through Pembina, North Dakota to Interstate 29. The rail border crossing remains open, but is now managed by the Port of Pembina.\n\nA post office called Noyes was established in 1927, and remained in operation until 1990. The community was named for J. A. Noyes, a customs agent.\n\nToday, Noyes is essentially a quiet community. Because of its proximity to the flood-prone Red River, it is protected by a levee which extends south from Emerson. The levee was built in 1989 as part of an International Levee agreement between both countries. When flooding cuts off Noyes from the rest of the United States, a local state of emergency is declared, allowing residents and emergency personnel to move freely across the border within the levee.\n\nThe 1931 Colonial Revival Noyes Customs and Immigration Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a well-preserved example of the nation's first purpose-built border checkpoints at land crossings.\n\n\n", "id": "7722042", "categories": ["Unincorporated communities in Minnesota"], "title": "Noyes, Minnesota"}

At the height of their popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, many brands of movie cameras came with a Wollensak Velostigmat lens. Wollensak reel-to-reel tape recorders were prized for their robust construction and value. In the 1960s, Wollensak was the choice tape recorder for amateur home, school, and office uses. They were produced in both stereo and mono designs.\n\nThe firm was founded in 1899 by Andrew Wollensak to produce camera shutters. At its peak in the 1950s, it employed over a thousand people. The company had several owners, including Revere Camera Company and 3M Company. Wollensak ceased operation in 1972.\n\nWollensak began making camera lenses in 1902. The company also produced camera shutters for large format cameras. They made shutters such as the Betax, Alphax, Optimo and, for the Graflex Corporation, Rapax.\n\nThe Betax shutters were patented in 1912 and remain popular for large format photographers today. Betax shutters are made in different sizes from size #0 to the huge size #5. These shutters are very reliable and relatively easy to repair.\n\nWollensak purchased the Fastax high speed rotating-prism camera developed by Bell Labs from Western Electric, and developed it to a capability of 10,000 frame/s. Fastax cameras were used for recording projectiles and explosions, including nuclear explosions. The cameras, with the rotating prism removed, were often used for \"streak\" and \"smear\" photography. see High speed photography.\n\nWollensak only ever made one still camera, the \"Stereo 10\" 35 mm 3D Camera\n\nThey also made some shutters and formed a partnership with The Revere Camera Company that led to them offering some cameras (mostly 8MM) under their name in the 50s and early 60s.\n\n3M also used the Wollensak brand name on audio tape recorders for many years; the Wollensak recorders were solidly built with all-metal construction. They were among the first manufacturers of cassette decks, as well as 8-track decks for home use.\n\n", "id": "7722092", "categories": ["Defunct manufacturing companies of the United States"], "title": "Wollensak"}

Cooper is best known as the production designer and creative consultant for Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions, the leading producer of American TV game shows. He joined the firm in 1960 and was associated with it until his death at age 79.\n\nCooper was hired as a TV art director for NBC in 1950 where he worked on various shows, including \"Your Show of Shows\", the \"Martin and Lewis Show\" (until it moved to Los Angeles), \"The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show\", \"The Jimmy Durante Show\" and the game shows \"Haggis Baggis\" and \"Charge Account\", among others. Through his association with NBC he knew Fred Rogers of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood fame and contributed to the first version of that show. He was also responsible for the sets for the 1956 Orson Welles Broadway production of King Lear which lasted for only 21 performances.\n\nCooper's best-known achievements were in creating set designs and game displays for TV quiz shows. He is credited with being the motivating force behind taking game shows from a simple table set in front of a drape to a full set designed for the show. The Goodson-Todman shows for which Cooper served as art director or creative consultant after 1960 include \"The Price Is Right\", \"The Match Game\" (including \"The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\"), \"What's My Line?\", \"I've Got a Secret\", \"To Tell the Truth\", \"He Said, She Said\" (and its successor \"Tattletales\"), \"Family Feud\", \"Beat the Clock\", \"Password\" (and its revivals \"Password Plus\" and \"Super Password\"), \"Say When!!\", the Jack Narz and Alex Trebek revivals of \"Concentration\", \"Double Dare\", \"Card Sharks\", \"Mindreaders\", \"The Better Sex\", \"Now You See It\", \"Blockbusters\", \"Child's Play\", \"Body Language\", and \"Trivia Trap\", as well as assorted pilots. In addition to being the scenic designer of \"Say When!!\", he was also the associate producer of that show. Cooper's design for \"Say When\" was among the first uses of alpha-numeric electronic readouts on TV and in the U.S., and helped the Split-flap display to become so popular for a time on TV and in other venues. Cooper's designs typically included technology not only for displaying numbers and letters, but also technology for controlling electromechanical devices such as lights and sound effects. Most of his designs were executed without the benefit of computer-generated special effects for which the industry is known today, but one of his shows, \"Classic Concentration\", was one of the earliest shows to implement its game board on a fully computerized display. Many of his sets utilized rotating elements: \"Family Feud\", \"Match Game\", \"Card Sharks\" and \"The Price Is Right\" with its well-known turntable. Game show producer Dan Enright, whose shows competed with those of Goodson-Todman, once referred to Cooper as \"Mark Goodson's secret weapon\".\n\nFor the 1958 Barry and Enright game show \"Concentration\", which aired on NBC for 15 years before moving into syndication, he created the display that showed the list of prizes as the contestants matched them. The display did not show a stagehand slipping in the name of the prize on the side, but rather had the prize name in place obscured by a sliding front cover which would then be pulled to the side to reveal the prize name. For the syndicated version of \"Concentration\", Cooper devised the \"Head Start\" feature in which four prizes were revealed prior to the start of the game. The prizes revealed were \"fee items\" for which the producers received a fee for being plugged on the show. \"Head Start\" guaranteed that the copy for those fee items was read and the fee collected regardless of whether or not the prizes were won during the game. For the 1972 version of \"The Price Is Right\" Cooper created the pricing games Any Number and Range Game. The physical game devices and other set pieces used on that version of the show prior to 2000 were designed by Cooper himself or under his supervision.\n\nCooper designed the psychedelic set for the 1969 syndicated revival of \"To Tell the Truth\". The brightly colored panels and elegant lettering he supervised for the show’s set in the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York gave a modern, youthful feel to a show that had already been a success for 12 years on CBS.\n\nCooper was a gold card member of IATSE Local 829, the United Scenic Artists, and for several years until his retirement was the oldest working member of that union.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7722106", "categories": ["1920 births", "American television producers", "1999 deaths"], "title": "Ted Cooper"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7722108", "text": "Matthew Flinders\n\nCaptain Matthew Flinders (16 March 1774 – 19 July 1814) was an English navigator and cartographer who led the second circumnavigation of New Holland that he would subsequently call \"Australia or Terra Australis\" and identified it as a continent. Abel Tasman had circumnavigated it more widely in 1642-43 and had charted its north coast in 1644. \n\nFlinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810. In the second voyage, George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, accompanied by Aboriginal man Bungaree.\nHeading back to England in 1803, Flinders' vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France (Mauritius). Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales – a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie.\n\nFlinders' health had suffered, however, and although he reached home in 1810, he did not live to see the success of his widely praised book and atlas, \"A Voyage to Terra Australis\". The location of his grave was lost by the mid-19th century but archaeologists excavating a former burial ground near London's Euston railway station for the High Speed 2 (HS2) project, announced in January 2019 that his remains had been identified.\n\nMatthew Flinders was born in Donington, Lincolnshire, England, the son of Matthew Flinders, a surgeon, and his wife Susannah, née Ward. He was educated at Cowley's Charity School, Donington, from 1780 and then at the Reverend John Shinglar's Grammar School at Horbling in Lincolnshire.\n\nIn his own words, he was \"induced to go to sea against the wishes of my friends from reading \"Robinson Crusoe\"\", and in 1789, at the age of fifteen, he joined the Royal Navy. Initially serving on , he transferred to , and in July 1790 was made midshipman on under Captain Pasley. By Pasley's recommendation, he joined Captain Bligh's expedition on , transporting breadfruit from Tahiti to Jamaica. This was also Bligh's second \"Breadfruit Voyage\" following on from the ill-fated voyage of the \"Bounty\".\n\nFlinders' first voyage to New South Wales, and first trip to Port Jackson, was in 1795 as a midshipman aboard , carrying the newly appointed governor of New South Wales Captain John Hunter. On this voyage he quickly established himself as a fine navigator and cartographer, and became friends with the ship's surgeon George Bass who was three years his senior and had been born from Donington.\n\nNot long after their arrival in Port Jackson, Bass and Flinders made two expeditions in two small open boats, named \"Tom Thumb\" and \"Tom Thumb II\" respectively: the first to Botany Bay and Georges River, the second, in the larger \"Tom Thumb II\", south from Port Jackson to Lake Illawarra, during which expedition they had to seek shelter at Wattamolla.\n\nIn 1798, Matthew Flinders, now a lieutenant, was given command of the sloop with orders \"to sail beyond Furneaux's Islands, and, should a strait be found, pass through it, and return by the south end of Van Diemen's Land\". The passage between the Australian mainland and Tasmania enabled savings of several days on the journey from England, and was named Bass Strait, after his close friend. In honour of this discovery, the largest island in Bass Strait would later be named Flinders Island. The town of Flinders near the mouth of Western Port also commemorates Bass' discovery of that bay and port on 4 January 1798. Flinders never entered Western Port, and passed Cape Schanck only on 3 May 1802.\n\nFlinders once more sailed \"Norfolk\", this time north on 17 July 1799; he arrived in Moreton Bay between modern-day Redcliffe and Brighton. He touched down at Pumicestone Passage, Redcliffe and Coochiemudlo Island and also rowed ashore at Clontarf. During this visit he named Redcliffe after the Red Cliffs.\n\nIn March 1800, Flinders rejoined \"Reliance\" and set sail for England.\n\nFlinders' work had come to the attention of many of the scientists of the day, in particular the influential Sir Joseph Banks, to whom Flinders dedicated his \"Observations on the Coasts of Van Diemen's Land, on Bass's Strait, etc.\". Banks used his influence with Earl Spencer to convince the Admiralty of the importance of an expedition to chart the coastline of New Holland. As a result, in January 1801, Flinders was given command of , a 334-ton sloop, and promoted to commander the following month.\n\n\"Investigator\" set sail for New Holland on 18 July 1801. Attached to the expedition were the botanist Robert Brown, botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer, landscape artist William Westall, gardener Peter Good, geological assistant John Allen, and John Crosley as astronomer. Vallance \"et al.\" comment that compared to the Baudin expedition this was a 'modest contingent of scientific gentlemen', which reflects 'British parsimony' in scientific endeavour.\n\nOn 17 April 1801, Flinders married his longtime friend Ann Chappelle (1772–1852) and had hoped to bring her with him to Port Jackson. However the Admiralty had strict rules against wives accompanying captains. Flinders brought Ann on board ship and planned to ignore the rules, but the Admiralty learned of his plans and he was severely chastised for his bad judgement and told he must remove her from the ship. This is well documented in correspondence between Flinders and his chief benefactor, Sir Joseph Banks, in May 1801:\n\nAs a result, Ann was obliged to stay in England and would not see her husband for nine years, following his imprisonment on the Isle de France (Mauritius, at the time a French possession) on his return journey. When they finally reunited, Matthew and Ann had one daughter, Anne, (1 April 1812 - 1892), who later married William Petrie (1821–1908). In 1853, the governments of New South Wales and Victoria bequeathed a belated pension to her (deceased) mother of £100 per year, to go to surviving issue of the union. This she accepted on behalf of her young son, William Matthew Flinders Petrie, who would go on to become an accomplished archaeologist and Egyptologist.\n\nAboard \"Investigator\", Flinders reached and named Cape Leeuwin on 6 December 1801, and proceeded to make a survey along the southern coast of the Australian mainland. On his way he stopped in at Oyster Harbour, Western Australia. There he found a copper plate that Captain Christopher Dixson, on , had left the year before. It was inscribed, \"Aug. 27 1800. Chr Dixson, ship Elligood\".\n\nOn 8 April 1802, while sailing east, Flinders sighted , a French corvette commanded by the explorer Nicolas Baudin, who was on a similar expedition for his government. Both men of science, Flinders and Baudin met and exchanged details of their discoveries, despite believing that their countries were at war; Flinders named the bay Encounter Bay.\n\nProceeding along the coast, Flinders explored Port Phillip (the site of the future city of Melbourne), which, unknown to him, had been discovered only ten weeks earlier by John Murray aboard . Flinders scaled Arthur's Seat, the highest point near the shores of the southernmost parts of the bay, where the ship had entered through The Heads. From there he saw a vast view of the surrounding land and bays. Flinders reported back to Governor King that the land had \"a pleasing and, in many parts, a fertile appearance\". After scaling the You Yangs to the northwest on 1 May, he stated \"I left the ship's name on a scroll of paper, deposited in a small pile of stones upon the top of the peak\". Here, Flinders was drawing upon a British tradition of constructing a stone cairn to mark a historical location. \n\nThe Matthew Flinders Cairn, which was later enlarged, is located on the upper slopes of Arthur's Seat, a short distance below Chapman's Point.\n\nWith stores running low, Flinders proceeded to Sydney, arriving on 9 May 1802. Here he was rejoined by Bungaree, the Aboriginal man who had accompanied him on his earlier coastal survey in 1799.\n\nHaving hastily prepared the ship, Flinders set sail again on 22 July, heading north and surveying the coast of Queensland. From there he passed through the Torres Strait, and explored the Gulf of Carpentaria. During this time, the ship was discovered to be badly leaking, and despite careening, they were unable to effect the necessary repairs. Reluctantly, Flinders returned to Sydney, though via the western coast, completing the circumnavigation of the continent. On the way, Flinders jettisoned two wrought-iron anchors which were found by divers in 1973 at Middle Island, Recherche Archipelago, Western Australia. The best bower anchor is on display at the South Australian Maritime Museum while the stream anchor can be seen at the National Museum of Australia.\n\nArriving in Sydney on 9 June 1803, \"Investigator\" was subsequently judged to be unseaworthy and condemned.\n\nWhile not formally trained in natural philosophy (now termed physics), Flinders coined the term \"dodge tide\" in reference to his 1802/3 observations that the tides in the very shallow Spencer and St Vincent's Gulfs seemed to be completely inert for several days, at select locations. Such phenomena have now also been found in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Irish Sea. In both the Irish Sea and the two South Australian gulfs, a north bound wave from the open ocean interferes non-linearly and with a reflected and weaker southbound wave, resulting in aperiodic and very dissipative tidal motions.\n\nIn his 1803 observations of the large tides at Broad Sound in Queensland (up to 11m range) Flinders correctly attributed this to two waves travelling north and south, respectively, and meeting at Broad Sound. He postulated that the dense reef wall further offshore caused the deep ocean tide to bifurcate at the northern southern ends of the reef, travel into shallow shelf waters and meet at Broad Sound. These phenomena were finally confirmed by G. I. Taylor in his landmark 1919 Irish Sea analysis.\n\nUnable to find another vessel suitable to continue his exploration, Flinders set sail for England as a passenger aboard . However, the ship was wrecked on Wreck Reefs, part of the Great Barrier Reef, approximately north of Sydney. Flinders navigated the ship's cutter across open sea back to Sydney, and arranged for the rescue of the remaining marooned crew. Flinders then took command of the 29-ton schooner in order to return to England, but the poor condition of the vessel forced him to put in at French-controlled Isle de France (now known as Mauritius) for repairs on 17 December 1803, just three months after Baudin had died there.\n\nWar with France had broken out again the previous May, but Flinders hoped his French passport (despite its being issued for \"Investigator\" and not \"Cumberland\") and the scientific nature of his mission would allow him to continue on his way. Despite this, and the knowledge of Baudin's earlier encounter with Flinders, the French governor, Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen, detained Flinders. The relationship between the men soured: Flinders was affronted at his treatment, and Decaen insulted by Flinders' refusal of an invitation to dine with him and his wife. Decaen was suspicious of the alleged scientific mission as the Cumberland carried no scientists and Decaen's search of Flinders' vessel uncovered a trunk full of papers (including despatches from the New South Wales Governor Philip Gidley King) that were not permitted under his scientific passport. Furthermore, one of King's despatches was specifically to the British Admiralty requesting more troops in case Decaen were to attack Port Jackson. Among the papers seized were the three logs of of which only Volume one and Volume two were returned to Flinders; these are now both held by the State Library of New South Wales. The third volume was later deposited in the Admiralty Library and is now held in the British Public Record Office. Decaen referred the matter to the French government; this was delayed not only by the long voyage but also by the general confusion of war. Eventually, on 11 March 1806, Napoleon gave his approval, but Decaen still refused to allow Flinders' release. By this stage Decaen believed Flinders' knowledge of the island's defences would have encouraged Britain to attempt to capture it. Nevertheless, in June 1809 the Royal Navy began a blockade of the island, and in June 1810 Flinders was paroled. Travelling via the Cape of Good Hope on , which was taking despatches back to Britain, he received a promotion to post-captain, before continuing to England.\n\nFlinders had been confined for the first few months of his captivity, but he was later afforded greater freedom to move around the island and access his papers. In November 1804 he sent the first map of the landmass he had charted (Y46/1) back to England. This was the only map made by Flinders where he used the name \"Australia or Terra Australis\" for the title instead of New Holland the name of the continent that James Cook had used in 1770 and Abel Tasman had coined a Dutch version of in 1644, and the first known time he used the word Australia. He used the name New Holland on his map only for the western part of the continent. Due to the delay caused by his lengthy confinement, the first published map of the Australian continent was the Freycinet Map of 1811, a product of the Baudin expedition, issued in 1811.\n\nFlinders finally returned to England in October 1810. He was in poor health but immediately resumed work preparing \"A Voyage to Terra Australis\" and his atlas of maps for publication. The full title of this book, which was first published in London in July 1814, was given, as was common at the time, a synoptic description: \"A Voyage to Terra Australis: undertaken for the purpose of completing the discovery of that vast country, and prosecuted in the years 1801, 1802, and 1803 in His Majesty's ship the\" Investigator, \"and subsequently in the armed vessel\" Porpoise \"and\" Cumberland Schooner. \"With an account of the shipwreck of the \"Porpoise\", arrival of the \"Cumberland\" at Mauritius, and imprisonment of the commander during six years and a half in that island\" . Original copies of the \"Atlas to Flinders' Voyage to Terra Australis\" are held at the Mitchell Library in Sydney as a portfolio that accompanied the book and included engravings of 16 maps, four plates of views and ten plates of Australian flora. The book was republished in three volumes in 1964, accompanied by a reproduction of the portfolio. Flinders' map of \"Terra Australis or Australia\" (so the two parts of the double name of his 1804 manuscript reversed) was first published in January 1814 and the remaining maps were published before his atlas and book.\n\nFlinders died, aged 40, on 19 July 1814, the day after the book and atlas was published. On 23 July, he was interred in the burial ground of St James's Church, Piccadilly, which was located some distance from the church, beside Hampstead Road, Camden, London. The burial ground was in use from 1790 until 1853. By 1852, the location of the grave had been forgotten due to alterations to the burial ground.\n\nIn 1878, the cemetery became St James's Gardens, Camden, with only a few gravestones lining the edges of the park. Part of the gardens, located between Hampstead Road and Euston railway station, was built over when Euston station was expanded, and Flinders' grave was thought to possibly lie under a station platform. The Gardens were closed to the public in 2017 for work on the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project which requires the expansion of Euston station.\n\nThe grave was located in January 2019 by archaeologists. His coffin was identified by its well-preserved lead coffin plate. It is proposed to re-bury his remains, at a site to be decided, after they have been examined by osteo-archaeologists.\n\nFlinders' map Y46/1 was never \"lost\". It had been stored and recorded by the UK Hydrographic Office before 1828. Geoffrey C. Ingleton mentioned Y46/1 in his book \"Matthew Flinders Navigator and Chartmaker\" on page 438. By 1987 every library in Australia had access to a microfiche copy of Flinders Y46/1. In 2001–2002 the Mitchell Library Sydney displayed Y46/1 at their \"Matthew Flinders – The Ultimate Voyage\" exhibition. Paul Brunton called Y46/1 \"the memorial of the great naval explorer Matthew Flinders\". The first hard-copy of Y46/1 and its cartouche was retrieved from the UK Hydrographic Office (Taunton, Somerset) by historian Bill Fairbanks in 2004. On 2 April 2004, copies of the chart were presented by three of Matthew Flinders's descendants to the Governor of New South Wales, in London, to be presented in turn to the people of Australia through their parliaments by 14 November, the 200th anniversary of the chart leaving Mauritius. This celebration marked the first time the naming of Australia was formally recognised.\n\nFlinders was not the first to use the word \"Australia\", nor was he the first to apply the name specifically to the continent. He owned a copy of Alexander Dalrymple's 1771 book \"An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean\", and it seems likely he borrowed it from there, but he applied it specifically to the continent, not the whole South Pacific region. In 1804 he wrote to his brother: \"I call the whole island Australia, or Terra Australis\" and later that year he wrote to Sir Joseph Banks and mentioned \"my general chart of Australia.\" A map Flinders constructed from all the information he had accumulated while he was in Australian waters and finished while he was detained by the French in Mauritius. Flinders explained in his letter to Banks:\n\nFlinders continued to promote the use of the word until his arrival in London in 1810. Here he found that Banks did not approve of the name and had not unpacked the chart he had sent him, and that \"New Holland\" and \"Terra Australis\" were still in general use. As a result, a book by Flinders was published under the title \"A Voyage to Terra Australis\" and his published map of 1814 also shows 'Terra Australis' as the first of the two name options, despite his objections. The final proofs were brought to him on his deathbed, but he was unconscious. The book was published on 18 July 1814, but Flinders did not regain consciousness and died the next day, never knowing that his name for the continent would be accepted.\n\nBanks wrote in a draft introduction to Flinders' \"Voyage\", referring to the map published by Melchisédech Thévenot in \"Relations des Divers Voyages\" (1663), and made well-known to English readers by Emanuel Bowen's adaptation of it, \"A Complete Map of the Southern Continent\", published in John Campbell's editions of John Harris's \"Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels\" (1744–48, and 1764):\n\nAlthough Thévenot said that he had taken his chart from the one inlaid into the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, in fact it appears to be an almost exact copy of that of Joan Blaeu in his \"Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus\" published in 1659. It appears to have been Thévenot who introduced a differentiation between \"Nova Hollandia\" to the west and \"Terre Australe\" to the east of the meridian corresponding to 135° East of Greenwich, emphasised by the latitude staff running down that meridian, as there is no such division on Blaeu's map.\n\nIn his book, Flinders wrote:\n\n...with the accompanying note at the bottom of the page:\n\nSo Flinders had concluded that the Terra Australis, as hypothesised by Aristotle and Ptolemy (which would later be discovered as Antarctica) did not exist; therefore he wanted the name applied to the continent of Australia, and it stuck.\n\nFlinders' book was widely read and gave the term \"Australia\" general currency. Lachlan Macquarie, Governor of New South Wales, became aware of Flinders' preference for the name Australia and used it in his dispatches to England. On 12 December 1817 he recommended to the Colonial Office that it be officially adopted. In 1824 the British Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia.\n\nAlthough he never used his own name for any feature in all his discoveries, Flinders' name is now associated with over 100 geographical features and places in Australia, including Flinders Island in Bass Strait, but not Flinders Island in South Australia, which he named for his younger brother, Samuel Flinders.\n\nFlinders is seen as being particularly important in South Australia, where he is considered the main explorer of the state. Landmarks named after him in South Australia include the Flinders Ranges and Flinders Ranges National Park, Flinders Column at Mount Lofty, Flinders Chase National Park on Kangaroo Island, Flinders University, Flinders Medical Centre, the suburb Flinders Park and Flinders Street in Adelaide. In Victoria, eponymous places include Flinders Peak, Flinders Street in Melbourne, the suburb of Flinders, the federal electorate of Flinders, and the Matthew Flinders Girls Secondary College in Geelong.\n\nFlinders Bay in Western Australia and Flinders Way in Canberra also commemorate him. Educational institutions named after him include Flinders Park Primary School on South Australia, and Matthew Flinders Anglican College on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. A former electoral district of the Queensland Parliament was named Flinders. There are also Flinders Highways in both Queensland and South Australia.\nBass & Flinders Point in the southernmost part of Cronulla in New South Wales features a monument to George Bass and Matthew Flinders, who explored the Port Hacking estuary.\n\nAustralia holds a large collection of statues erected in Flinders' honour. In his native England, the first statue of Flinders was erected on 16 March 2006 (his birthday) in his hometown of Donington. The statue also depicts his beloved cat Trim, who accompanied him on his voyages. In July 2014, on the 200-year anniversary of his death, a large bronze statue of Flinders by the sculptor Mark Richards was unveiled at Australia House, London by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and later installed at Euston station near the presumed location of his grave.\n\nFlinders' proposal for the use of iron bars to be used to compensate for the magnetic deviations caused by iron on board a ship resulted in their being known as Flinders bars.\n\nFlinders, who was Sir John Franklin's cousin by marriage, John's mother Hannah being the sister of Matthew's step mother Elizabeth, instilled in him a love for navigating and took him with him on his voyage aboard \"Investigator\".\n\nIn 1964 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Postmaster-General's Department, again in 1980, and in 1998 with George Bass.\n\n\"Flindersia\" is a genus of 14 species of tree in the citrus family. Named by \"Investigator\"s botanist, Robert Brown in honour of Matthew Flinders.\n\nFlinders landed on Coochiemudlo Island on 19 July 1799, while he was searching for a river in the southern part of Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia.\nThe island's residents celebrate Flinders Day annually, commemorating the landing. The celebrations are usually held on a weekend near 19 July, the actual date of the landing.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7722108", "categories": ["Pre-Separation Queensland", "Maritime writers", "Explorers of Queensland", "Nautical captains", "1814 deaths", "English sailors", "Explorers of Western Australia", "Explorers of Australia", "English explorers", "Explorers of South Australia", "Articles containing video clips", "People from Donington, Lincolnshire", "Royal Navy officers", "English cartographers", "Maritime exploration of Australia", "1774 births", "Hydrographers"], "title": "Matthew Flinders"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7722140", "text": "P16\n\np16 (also known as p16, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, multiple tumor suppressor 1 and as several other synonyms), is a tumor suppressor protein, that in humans is encoded by the \"CDKN2A\" gene. p16 plays an important role in cell cycle regulation by decelerating the cell's progression from G1 phase to S phase, and therefore acts as a tumor suppressor that is implicated in the prevention of cancers, notably melanoma, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and esophageal cancer. p16 can be used as a biomarker to improve the histological diagnostic accuracy of CIN3. Expression of the CDKN2A gene is frequently changed in a wide variety of tumors.\n\np16 was originally found in an “open reading frame of 148 amino acids encoding a protein with a molecular weight of 16 kDa that comprises four ankyrin repeats.” The name of p16 is derived from its molecular weight, while the alternative name p16 additionally refers to its role in inhibiting CDK4.\n\np16 is also known as:\n\nIn humans, p16 is encoded by the CDKN2A gene, located on chromosome 9 (9p21.3). This gene generates several transcript variants that differ in their first exons. At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported, two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4. The remaining transcript includes an alternate exon 1 located 20 kb upstream of the remainder of the gene; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame (ARF) that specifies a protein that is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants. The ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53, as it can interact with and sequester MDM2, a protein responsible for the degradation of p53. In spite of their structural and functional differences, the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene, through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression, share a common functionality in controlling the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene.\n\nWhen organisms age, the expression of p16 increases to reduce the proliferation of stem cells. This reduction in the division and production of stem cells protects against cancer while increasing the risks associated with cellular senescence.\n\np16 is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). It slows down the cell cycle by prohibiting progression from G1 phase to S phase. Otherwise, CDK4/6 binds cyclin D and forms an active protein complex that phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Once phosphorylated, pRB dissociates from the transcription factor E2F1. This liberates E2F1 from its bound state in the cytoplasm and allows it to enter the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, E2F1 promotes the transcription of target genes that are essential for transition from G1 to S phase.\n\nThis pathway connects the processes of tumor oncogenesis and senescence, fixing them on opposite ends of a spectrum. On one end, the hypermethylation, mutation, or deletion of p16 leads to downregulation of the gene and can lead to cancer through the dysregulation of cell cycle progression. Conversely, activation of p16 through reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, or senescence leads to the buildup of p16 in tissues and is implicated in the aging of cells.\n\nRegulation of p16 is complex and involves the interaction of several transcription factors, as well as several proteins involved in epigenetic modification through methylation and repression of the promoter region.\n\nPRC1 and PRC2 are two protein complexes that modify the expression of p16 through the interaction of various transcription factors that execute methylation patterns that can repress transcription of p16. These pathways are activated in the cellular response to reduce senescence.\n\nMutations resulting in deletion or reduction of function of the CDKN2A gene are associated with increased risk of a wide range of cancers, and alterations of the gene are frequently seen in cancer cell lines. Examples include:\n\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma is often associated with mutations in the CDKN2A gene.\n\nCarriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A have, besides their high risks of melanoma, also increased risks of pancreatic, lung, laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancers. Tobacco smoking increases the carriers’ susceptibility for such non-melanoma cancers.\n\nHomozygous deletions of p16 are frequently found in esophageal cancer and gastric cancer cell lines.\n\nGermline mutations in CDKN2A are associated with an increased susceptibility to develop skin cancer.\n\nHypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes has been implicated in various cancers. In 2013, a meta-analysis revealed an increased frequency of DNA methylation of the p16 gene in esophageal cancer. As the degree of tumor differentiation increased, so did the frequency of p16 DNA methylation.\n\nTissue samples of primary oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) often display hypermethylation in the promoter regions of p16. Cancer cells show a significant increase in the accumulation of methylation in CpG islands in the promoter region of p16. This epigenetic change leads to loss of the tumor suppressor gene function through two possible mechanisms: first, methylation can physically inhibit the transcription of the gene, and second, methylation can lead to the recruitment of transcription factors that repress transcription. Both mechanisms cause the same end result: downregulation of gene expression that leads to decreased levels of the p16 protein. It has been suggested that this process is responsible for the development of various forms of cancer serving as an alternative process to gene deletion or mutation.\n\np16 positivity has been shown to be favorably prognostic in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. In a retrospective trial analysis of patients with Stage III and IV oropharyngeal cancer, HPV status was assessed and it was found that the 3-year rates of overall survival were 82.4% (95% CI, 77.2 to 87.6) in the HPV-positive subgroup and 57.1% (95% CI, 48.1 to 66.1) in the HPV-negative subgroup, and the 3-year rates of progression-free survival were 73.7% (95% CI, 67.7 to 79.8) and 43.4% (95% CI, 34.4 to 52.4), respectively. p16 status is so prognostic that the AJCC staging system has been revised to include p16 status in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer group staging.\n\nExpression of p16 is used as a prognostic biomarker for certain types of cancer. The reason for this is different types of cancer can have different effects on p16 expression: cancers that overexpress p16 are usually caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), whereas cancers in which p16 is downregulated will usually have other causes. For patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, using immunohistochemistry to detect the presence of the p16 biomarker has been shown to be the strongest indicator of disease course. Presence of the biomarker is associated with a more favorable prognosis as measured by cancer-specific survival (CSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), locoregional control (LRC), as well as other measurements. The appearance of hypermethylation of p16 is also being evaluated as a potential prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer.\n\np16 deletion detected by FISH in surface epithelial mesothelial proliferations is predictive of underlying invasive mesothelioma.\n\nAs consensus grows regarding the strength of p16 as a biomarker for detecting and determining prognoses of cancer, p16 immunohistochemistry is growing in importance.\n\np16 is a widely used immunohistochemical marker in gynecologic pathology. Strong and diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of p16 in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the female genital tract is strongly associated with high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and neoplasms of cervical origin. The majority of SCCs of uterine cervix express p16. However, p16 can be expressed in other neoplasms and in several normal human tissues.\n\nMore than a third of urinary bladder SCCs express p16. SCCs of urinary bladder express p16 independent of gender. p16 immunohistochemical expression alone cannot be used to discriminate between SCCs arising from uterine cervix versus urinary bladder.\n\nConcentrations of p16INK4a increase dramatically as tissue ages. p16INK4a, along with senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, is regarded to be a biomarker of cellular senescence. Therefore, p16INK4a could potentially be used as a blood test that measures how fast the body's tissues are aging at a molecular level. Notably, a recent survey of cellular senescence induced by multiple treatments to several cell lines does not identify p16 as belonging to a \"core signature\" of senescence markers.\n\nIt has been used as a target to delay some aging changes in mice.\n\np16INK4a has been shown to prevent the depletion during aging of neural stem and progenitor cells in one of the neurogenic niche of the adult brain, i.e, the subventricular zone, which generates throughout life new neurons migrating to the olfactory bulb . Deletion of p16INK4a does not affect neurogenesis in the other adult neurogenic niche, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus . However, recently, it has been demonstrated that p16INK4a protects from depletion after a powerful proneurogenic stimulus - i.e., running - also stem and progenitor cells of the aged dentate gyrus . In fact, after deletion of p16INK4a, stem cells of the dentate gyrus are greatly activated by running, while, in wild-type p16INK4a dentate gyrus stem cells are not affected by running. Therefore, p16Ink4a plays a role in the maintenance of dentate gyrus stem cells after stimulus, by keeping a reserve of their self-renewal capacity during aging. Since the dentate gyrus plays a key role in spatial and contextual memory formation, p16INK4a is implicated in the maintenance of cognitive functions during aging.\n\nResearchers Manuel Serrano, Gregory J. Hannon and David Beach discovered p16 in 1993 and correctly characterized the protein as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Since its discovery, p16 has become significant in the field of cancer research. The protein was suspected to be involved in carcinogenesis due to the observation that mutation or deletion in the gene was implicated in human cancer cell lines. The detection of p16 inactivation in familial melanoma supplied further evidence. p16 deletion, mutation, hypermethylation, or overexpression is now associated with various cancers. Whether mutations in p16 can be considered to be driver mutations requires further investigation.\n\np16 has been shown to interact with:\n\n\n", "id": "7722140", "categories": [], "title": "P16"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7722159", "text": "McNulty\n\nMcNulty ()—also spelled MacNulty, McAnulty, McEnulty and Nulty amongst other variations—is an Irish surname, meaning \"son of the Ulsterman\". Usually considered a branch of the Ulaid ruling dynasty of \"Mac Duinnshléibhe\" (MacDonlevy) who fled Ulaid to Ailech after the formers conquest in 1177 by the Normans, DNA analysis points to descent from other Ulaid families as well. After the Battle of Kinsale in 1602, some McDonlevys and McNultys migrated to the province of Connacht where their name is now common.\n\nThe name is said to have arisen from a branch of the ruling Ulaid dynasty of \"Mac Duinnshléibhe\" (MacDonlevy) who had migrated to what is now County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland after John de Courcy's conquest of Ulaid in 1177. Here some of the MacDonlevys were nicknamed \"Ultagh/Ultach\". However, historical records such as the 1659 \"Census\" as well as Griffith's Valuation (1848-1864) show that concentrations of McNultys were found in parts of Ireland where the MacDonlevys had little presence, coupled with DNA analysis showing that the McNultys may actually derive from other Gaelic families that migrated from Ulaid and not just the MacDonlevy's. The names \"Ultagh/Ultach\" and \"Mac an Ultaigh\" applied to only those that fled Ulaid and was not used for those that remained.\n\nRegardless of their actual origin, the first McNulty to be recorded is found in the Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1281, where an \"\"Murtough Macan-Ulty\"\" is listed as a distinguished fatality at the battle of Desertcreagh in present-day County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.\n\nThe probable transition of the name \"Mac an Ultaigh\" from the Ultagh MacDonlevy's can be seen around 1601 where one \"Morris Ultagh\" is recorded as \"Morris m'Nich Ultagh\". The surname prefix \"m'Nich\" appears to be an English confusion of the female prefix \"Nic\" with the male prefix \"Mac\".\n\nOther variant spellings of McNulty include McNaulty, McNalty, and rarely as O'Nalty, Nolty, McNult, McEnulty and McKnulty. and others.\n\nIn County Clare and its adjacent County Tipperary in the southwest of the Republic of Ireland, the toponymics Connoulty and Kinoulty are encountered, and are believed to be Anglicisations of \"Mac an Ultaigh\".\n\nBy 1980, there were 19,469 persons surnamed McNulty in the United States Social Security Administration data base. The surname McNulty was, then, the 2332 most frequently occurring surname in that database. Some of the first McNulty immigrants to North America arrived in Philadelphia and New York City in the very early 19th century and, later, more numerously, in both Philadelphia and New York City between 1840 and 1860, during which period the great Irish Potato Famine occurred.\n\nThere are an estimated 421 persons surnamed McNulty in Australia. Denis McInulty, one of the first McNulty to arrive in Australia, arrived there from Scotland on 16 May 1846 on the prisoner transport the \"China\" under a 10-year sentence of the Glasgow Justiciary Court.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the surname McNulty is shared by an estimated 7,888 people and is approximately the 1329th most popular surname in the country.\n\nBernadette McNulty, Prominent 1970's Womans rights Activist.\n\n\n Frank Joseph McNulty, the U.S. labor leader and President of the IBEW (1903–1918), was in 1922 elected to the 68th US Congress as a Democrat from New Jersey.\n\n\n\"\"Acta Non Verba\"\" (\"Deeds Not Words\"), the motto of the United States Merchant Marine Academy, founded 1943\n\n\nThe USS McNulty (DE-581) was a World War II escort destroyer named for Lt.

Pioneer military aviators, the McNulty have served as pilots and flight surgeons with U.S. air forces since their inauguration as the Aviation Section of the U.S. Army Signal Corps.\n\nMaj. Gerald M. McNulty (USAF) commanded the 61st Airlift Squadron (the Green Hornets) of the 314th Airlift Wing during the highly successful 20 October 1950 U.N. airborne invasion of Sukchon and Sunchon, North Korea. The 61st Airlift Squadron received the Distinguished Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United States for its actions during the Korean War while under Maj. McNulty’s command. For award of the Distinguished Unit Citation, the collective degree of valor (combat heroism) against an armed enemy by the unit nominated must be the same as that which would warrant an individual award of the Air Force Cross. The 314th successfully accomplished the aerial invasion by having its pilots, including Maj. McNulty's Green Hornets, fly their unarmed Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar at extreme low altitude during the invasion for drop precision while exposing their craft to withering enemy ground fire. The 314th Airlift Wing dropped 2,800 paratroopers of the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment and 300 tons of war materials.\n\nDuring the Korean War, U.N. forces, including U.S. armed forces, were pitted against North Korean and, later, also mainland Chinese communist forces. Prior to this airborne assault, the 1950 U.N. offensive in Korea had already resulted in the U.N. capture of the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. 30 miles north of Pyongyang, however, there still sat the heavily fortified and armed enemy positions at Sukchon and Sunchon. The unexpected U.N. precision airborne assault of Sukchon and Sunchon set the cities’ North Korean defenders back on their heels and reeling toward the Chinese border, abandoning strongly fortified positions and leaving behind loaded weapons with ammunition stockpiles beside them. One day later, on 21 October 1950, UN forces out of Pyongyang were able to link with the paratroopers of the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team to consolidate the position. The 314th Airlift Wing continued to bring in supplies thereafter to fortify the U.N. position. 4,000 more troops and 600 more tons of jeeps, trucks, howitzers and other war materials were airlifted.\n\nMaj. McNulty had earlier served as operations officer of the United States Army Air Force’s 668th Bomb Squadron, flying A-26 Invader bomber missions over the coasts of France and the Low Countries during World War II. Many of the highly experienced pilots of the 668th flew 60 or more bombing missions in the European theatre of World War II. The life expectancy of an Allied bomber crewman flying bomber missions over Europe during World War II was just 12 missions. McNulty arrived at the 668th at the rank of captain and already a seasoned aerial combatant.\n\nFor \"Heroism and extraordinary achievement while participating in an actual flight\"\n\nFor \"gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States\"\n\n\nFor \"Exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services and achievements\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In Honor of those Members of the Central Intelligence Agency Who Gave Their Lives in the Service of Their Country\"\n\n103 stars representing Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents who died in service of their country are carved into the Memorial's white Vermont marble on the north wall of the original CIA headquarters building. One of these stars honors CIA case officer or senior operative Wayne J. McNulty of the CIA's paramilitary Special Activities Division, National Clandestine Service (responsible for covert operations). In 1968, during the \"Secret War\" in Laos, Hmong forces discovered a cache of North Vietnamese Army (NVA) weapons during cleanup operations. W.J. McNulty was killed by NVA ground fire while flying with Air America (airline) helicopters to seize and retrieve the weapons. McNulty was the first C.I.A. operative to be killed in Laos.\n\nA World War II veteran Wayne J.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7722184", "text": "Xiao Cha\n\nEmperor Xuan of (Western) Liang ((西)梁宣帝; 519–562), personal name Xiao Cha (蕭詧), courtesy name Lisun (理孫), was the founding emperor of the Chinese Western Liang dynasty. He took the Liang throne under support from Western Wei after Western Wei forces had defeated and killed his uncle Emperor Yuan in 554, but many traditional historians, because he controlled little territory and relied heavily on military support by Western Wei and Western Wei's successor state Northern Zhou, did not consider him and his successors true emperors of Liang. Instead, their state is traditionally considered separate, as Western Liang (or Later Liang).\n\nXiao Cha was born in 519, as the third son of Xiao Tong, then the crown prince to Liang Dynasty's founder Emperor Wu. His mother was Xiao Tong's concubine Consort Gong. He was considered studious, concentrating particularly on Buddhist sutras, and as Emperor Wu was a devout Buddhist, he was happy that his grandson studied sutras in this manner. When Emperor Wu created Xiao Tong's sons dukes sometime between 520 and 527, Xiao Cha was created the Duke of Qujiang.\n\nIn 531, Xiao Tong died, but instead of creating Xiao Tong's oldest son Xiao Huan (蕭歡) the Duke of Huarong crown prince to succeed him (as was expected under Confucian principles of succession), Emperor Wu created Xiao Tong's younger brother Xiao Gang crown prince instead. However, he felt that he did not treat Xiao Tong's sons fairly, and therefore he created them princes—in Xiao Cha's case, the Prince of Yueyang—and gave them honors only slightly subordinate to their uncles. Because the capital commandery of Eastern Yang Province (東揚州, modern central and eastern Zhejiang), Kuaiji Commandery (the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay), was the richest commandery of the entire empire, he rotated them as the governor of Eastern Yang Province, and Xiao Cha was thus rotated there sometime before 546. However, despite these special treatments, Xiao Cha was still angry that he and his brothers were passed over by Emperor Wu. He saw that Emperor Wu, late in his long reign (since 502), was ruling over an imperial regime that was becoming inefficient and beset by factionalism between Emperor Wu's sons, and therefore, when he was made the governor of Yong Province (雍州, modern northwestern Hubei) in 546, he thought that this would be a good chance for him to establish a power base of his own, and therefore he cultivated the loyalty of the people to him by governing carefully.\n\nIn 548, the general Hou Jing rebelled and attacked the capital Jiankang, capturing it in 549 and taking Emperor Wu and Crown Prince Gang hostage. (Emperor Wu died later that year and was succeeded by Crown Prince Gang (as Emperor Jianwen), albeit under Hou's control.) Meanwhile, also in 548, Emperor Wu had made Xiao Cha's older brother Xiao Yu (蕭譽) the Prince of Hedong the governor of Xiang Province (湘州, modern central Hunan), rotating the previous governor of Xiang Province, Zhang Zuan (張纘) to Yong Province. Zhang was a close friend of Emperor Wu's powerful son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong, who was then the governor of the key Jing Province (荊州, modern western and central Hubei), and he did not take Xiao Yu seriously, making Xiao Yu felt disrespected. Xiao Yu therefore detained Zhang and did not permit him to leave. Further, when Xiao Yi called for the provincial governors in his command region (which, inter alia, included both Xiang and Yong Provinces) to send troops to help lift the siege on Jiankang, Xiao Yu refused, and while Xiao Cha sent a detachment, he refused to command the detachment personally. When Zhang fled from Xiao Yu's custody late in 548, then, he went to Xiao Yi, and, bearing grudges against Xiao Yu, falsely accused Xiao Yu, Xiao Cha, and their cousin Xiao Cao (蕭慥) the Prince of Guiyang and governor of Xin Province (信州, modern eastern Chongqing) of conspiring against Xiao Yi. Xiao Yi therefore killed Xiao Cao and prepared an army to attack Xiao Yu.\n\nXiao Yu was initially able to repel Xiao Yi's attack and cause Xiao Yi's heir apparent Xiao Fangdeng (蕭方等) to die in battle in summer 549, but by fall 549, he had been defeated by Xiao Yi's general Bao Quan (鮑泉), who put Xiao Yu's headquarters at Changsha (長沙, in modern Changsha, Hunan) under siege. Xiao Yu requested aid from Xiao Cha, and Xiao Cha commanded an army to attack Xiao Yi's headquarters at Jiangling. He put Jiangling under siege, but his attack was affected by heavy rains and repelled by Xiao Yi's general Wang Sengbian, and when his own general Du Ze (杜崱) surrendered to Xiao Yi, and Du Ze's brother Du An (杜岸) further launched a surprise attack on Xiao Cha's headquarters at Xiangyang (襄陽, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), Xiao Cha was forced to withdraw back to Xiangyang. Unable to help his brother and fearing that he would become Xiao Yi's next target—indeed, Xiao Yi then sent the general Liu Zhongli (柳仲禮) to attack Xiao Cha—Xiao Cha submitted to Western Wei, offering to become a vassal, and sought aid, sending his wife Princess Wang and his heir apparent Xiao Liao (蕭嶚) to Western Wei as hostages. Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of Western Wei, accepted Xiao Cha's submission and sent the general Yang Zhong (楊忠) to aid Xiao Cha, and Yang defeated and captured Liu in spring 550. Yang subsequently entered into a treaty with Xiao Yi, putting Xiao Cha under Western Wei's protection. Xiao Yi sacked Changsha and executed Xiao Yu in 550.\n\nIn the summer of 550, Western Wei offered to declare Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang to inherit Emperor Wu's throne. Xiao Cha declined, but accepted the lesser title of Prince of Liang and also assumed acting imperial authority. Later that year, made a trip to the Western Wei capital Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Wen of Western Wei and Yuwen. In spring 551, when his uncle Xiao Guan (蕭綸) the Prince of Shaoling was captured and killed by Western Wei troops commanded by Yang, Xiao Cha, who respected Xiao Guan, took his body and buried it with honors. In summer 551, when he heard that Hou was launching an attack on Xiao Yi's domain, he sent his general Cai Dabao (蔡大寶) with an army heading toward Jiangling, claiming to be ready to render assistance, but after Xiao Yi sent a rebuking letter, he ordered Cai to withdraw.\n\nIn 552, after defeating Hou, Xiao Yi declared himself emperor (as Emperor Yuan) and set his capital at Jiangling. Believing himself to be strong, he was arrogant in his dealings with Western Wei, drawing attention from Yuwen, who began to consider invading Liang. When Xiao Cha became aware of this, he paid additional tribute to Western Wei to try to fan the flame. Subsequently, in spring 553, when Emperor Yuan not only made the Western Wei envoy Yuwen Renshu (宇文仁恕) felt insulted by not treating him with as much respect as the envoy from Northern Qi, but further made demands to Yuwen Tai to return former Liang territory taken by Western Wei, Yuwen Tai decided to invade the Liang. In winter 553, Northern Zhou troops, commanded by Yu Jin (于謹), arrived at Xiangyang, and Xiao Cha's forces joined them and continued to advance south toward Jiangling. Emperor Yuan was caught unprepared, and while he summoned his generals Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin to come to his aid, Emperor Yuan surrendered before they could arrive. Xiao Cha took the custody of Emperor Yuan, interrogating and insulting him heavily. Around the new year 555, with approval from Western Wei authorities, Xiao Cha put Emperor Yuan to death by suffocating him with a large bag full of dirt. He also executed Emperor Yuan's sons who were captured when Jiangling fell.\n\nWestern Wei created Xiao Cha Emperor of (Western) Liang, and he declared himself as such in spring 555 (as Emperor Xuan). Western Wei forces transferred Jiangling and the surrounding area to Emperor Xuan, but required him to transfer control of the Xiangyang region in exchange, and further left a military garrison at Jiangling, both to protect Emperor Xuan and to make sure that he would not rebel. Further, Western Wei troops pillaged Jiangling and took most of the inhabitants and the Liang imperial treasures back to Chang'an. While Western Wei troops under Yu were still at Jiangling, Emperor Xuan's subordinate Yin Deyi (尹德毅) suggested that he make a surprise attack on Yu and slaughter the Western Wei troops, then reassert Liang's independence. Emperor Xuan declined, reasoning that Western Wei had protected him greatly and that to turn against Western Wei would be unjust. He later regretted the decision, but the decision was probably a correct one as the other Liang generals showed no inclination of recognizing him as emperor. (As whether Emperor Xuan was a \"legitimate\" emperor of Liang was thereafter historically debated, his state is usually referred to by historians as either Western Liang or Later Liang.)\n\nEmperor Xuan posthumously honored his father Xiao Tong and Xiao Tong's wife Crown Princess Cai as emperor and empress, and honored his mother Consort Gong as empress dowager. He created his wife Princess Wang empress, and as his heir apparent Xiao Liao had died by this point, he created Xiao Liao's younger brother Xiao Kui as crown prince. He entrusted much of the governmental matters to Cai Dabao and Wang Cao (王操), both of whom served him faithfully. He appeared to have full expectation that he would be able to put additional Liang provinces under his control, but immediately, the Liang generals, including Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin, refused to recognize him. Wang Lin, who controlled modern Hunan and later parts of modern Hubei, indeed, sent his general Hou Ping (侯平) to attack Emperor Xuan, and while the attack was unsuccessful, Emperor Xuan was unable to expand his holdings.\n\nLater in 555, Wang Sengbian declared Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming emperor. In fall 555, after Wang Sengbian was killed by his lieutenant Chen Baxian, Chen deposed Xiao Yuanming and declared Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi emperor (as Emperor Jing). After Chen had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him in 558, establishing Chen Dynasty as its Emperor Wu, Wang Lin declared Emperor Yuan's grandson Xiao Zhuang emperor, thus maintaining a competing claim for the Liang throne.\n\nIn late 558, with Wang Lin having advanced east to try to attack Chen, Emperor Xuan sent Wang Cao to try to seize the commanderies forming modern Hunan from Xiao Zhuang's domain, although the scope of success for this action was unclear. In any case, however, when Hou Tian (侯瑱), a general of Chen Baxian's nephew Emperor Wen of Chen defeated Wang Lin in spring 560, a combination of Emperor Xuan's and Northern Zhou troops were able to take the western half of Xiao Zhuang's territory, and Emperor Xuan assumed control over that territory, albeit requiring Northern Zhou military support.\n\nIn fall 560, Hou Tian continued his advance, intending to take Xiang Province from Emperor Wenxuan. Northern Zhou generals Heruo Dun (賀若敦) and Dugu Sheng (獨孤盛) led their troops against Hou, and Chen and Northern Zhou troops soon stalemated, and while initially, Hou was unable to make much progress against Heruo and Dugu, soon, problems with food supplies and illnesses caused Northern Zhou troops to be worn down. Around the new year 561, Dugu was forced to withdraw, putting Heruo under even greater pressure. By spring 561, Yin Liang (殷亮), who was defending Changsha, surrendered to Chen. Hou Tian then proposed to Heruo to let him withdraw peacefully. Heruo agreed and withdrew, and all of the territory previously taken from Xiao Zhuang were now in Chen hands, limiting Emperor Xuan's domain to the Jiangling region again.\n\nEmperor Xuan, depressed that his territory was small and heavily damaged by warfare, soon began to suffer from a serious skin lesion on his back. He died in spring 562. Xiao Kui succeeded him (as Emperor Ming).\n\nThe historian Li Yanshou (李延寿), in his \"History of Northern Dynasties\", had this to say about Emperor Xuan, both praising him and noting some of his idiosyncricies:\n\nEmperor Xuan was literarily capable, and he wrote 15 volumes of literary works and 36 volumes of commentary on Buddhist sutras.\n\n\n", "id": "7722184", "categories": ["Northern Wei Buddhists", "562 deaths", "Northern Zhou Buddhists", "Liang dynasty emperors", "Liang dynasty Buddhists", "519 births"], "title": "Xiao Cha"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7722325", "text": "Xiao Yuanming\n\nXiao Yuanming (蕭淵明) (died 556), courtesy name Jingtong (靖通), often known by his pre-ascension title of Marquess of Zhenyang (貞陽侯), at times known by his post-removal title Duke of Jian'an (建安公), honored Emperor Min (閔皇帝) by Xiao Zhuang, was briefly an emperor of the Chinese Liang Dynasty. He was the nephew of the founding emperor Emperor Wu. In 555, with Liang in disarray after Western Wei had captured and killed Emperor Yuan, Northern Qi, which had held Xiao Yuanming as an honored captive since 547, forced the general Wang Sengbian to accept Xiao Yuanming as emperor. Soon, however, Wang's subordinate Chen Baxian killed Wang and removed Xiao Yuanming from the throne, replacing him with Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi (Emperor Jing). Xiao Yuanming died the following year.\n\nIt is not known when Xiao Yuanming was born. His father Xiao Yi (蕭懿) was a major general during late Southern Qi, and of Xiao Yi's sons, five (perhaps all) are known to history. Xiao Yuanming was the youngest among these sons. As Xiao Yi was forced to commit suicide by Southern Qi's cruel emperor Xiao Baojuan in 500, Xiao Yuanming could not have been born any later than 501.\n\nAfter Xiao Yi's death, Xiao Yi's younger brother and Xiao Yuanming's uncle Xiao Yan rebelled at his post of Xiangyang, seeking to avenge Xiao Yi. By 502 he put the capital Jiankang under siege, and Xiao Baojuan was killed by his own generals. Later that year, Xiao Yan seized the throne from Xiao Baojuan's younger brother Emperor He of Southern Qi, ending Southern Qi and establishing Liang Dynasty (as Emperor Wu). Emperor Wu was said to love Xiao Yuanming greatly, and he created Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang.\n\nNothing is known about Xiao Yuanming's career as an official until 547, when it was recorded that he was the governor of Yu Province (豫州, modern central Anhui). The people were said to be so impressed by his governance that they made a stone monument commemorating his term of office. However, it became known later that the artisans who carved the monument were associated with and paid by Xiao Yuanming. Therefore, it became widely believed that he had encouraged the people to create the monument to praise himself.\n\nIn 547, the Eastern Wei general Hou Jing, in conflict with the regent Gao Cheng, surrendered his domain—13 provinces between the Yellow River and the Huai River—to Liang. Emperor Wu accepted Hou's surrender and commissioned an army to aid Hou, to be commanded by Emperor Wu's grandson Xiao Huili (蕭會理) the Prince of Nankang. Xiao Yuanming requested to accompany Xiao Huili, and was made Xiao Huili's assistant. However, Xiao Huili was cowardly and arrogant, and he refused to meet his subordinate generals, even Xiao Yuanming. Xiao Yuanming secretly informed Emperor Wu of this, and Emperor Wu relieved Xiao Huili of his command and put Xiao Yuanming in command.\n\nThe Liang army, commanded by Xiao Yuanming, advanced on the Eastern Wei city Pengcheng (彭城, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), and Xiao Yuanming camped at Hanshan (寒山), in Pengcheng's vicinity, and built a dam over Si River (泗水) to use water to attack Pengcheng. Xiao Yuanming's lieutenant, the general Yang Kan (羊侃), quickly completed the dam, but when Yang advised Xiao Yuanming to attack Pengcheng, Xiao Yuanming hesitated. Because Xiao Yuanming could not come up with a coordinated strategy, the generals under him began to carry out their own actions, including pillaging the people in the region, and Xiao Yuanming was unable to stop them, save the units directly under his own command.\n\nLate in 547, the Eastern Wei forces commanded by Murong Shaozong (慕容紹宗) arrived, and instead of engaging the Eastern Wei forces quickly as Yang suggested, Xiao Yuanming became drunk with wine and allowed Murong's army to settle in. When the armies did engage, the Liang forces were initially successful, but Murong's counterattack caused Liang forces to collapse, and Xiao Yuanming was captured. However, the people of the region was impressed by his refusal to pillage them, and gave him the epithet \"the righteous prince\" (義王, \"yi wang\"). He was taken to the Eastern Wei capital Yecheng (鄴城, in modern Handan, Hebei), where Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei formally received and rebuked him, and then released him, sending him to Gao Cheng's headquarters at Jinyang (晉陽, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), where Gao treated him with honor—intending to use Xiao Yuanming as a pawn in negotiations with Liang. Subsequently, Gao allowed Xiao Yuanming to write to Emperor Wu and offered to return Xiao Yuanming—causing Hou, who had by that point lost the 13 provinces but controlled Yu Province, to rebel in 548, capturing Jiankang in 549, taking Emperor Wu and his crown prince Xiao Gang hostages, and throwing Liang into a general state of confusion and unrest.\n\nLittle is known about Xiao Yuanming's activities while in Eastern Wei and its successor state Northern Qi (as Gao Cheng's successor and brother Gao Yang seized the throne from Emperor Xiaojing in 550 and established Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan), although it was said that Xiao Yuanming cried bitterly when he heard about the fall of Jiankang. He was given the office of \"sanqi changshi\" (散騎常侍) -- an honorific office with little responsibilities.\n\nIn 552, Emperor Wu's son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong defeated Hou and declared himself emperor (as Emperor Yuan), setting his capital at Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) rather than the war-devastated Jiankang, but in 554, Western Wei forces captured Jiangling, capturing and then executing Emperor Yuan. In light of Emperor Yuan's death, his most important general Wang Sengbian and Wang's lieutenant Chen Baxian, who together controlled the eastern empire, welcomed Emperor Yuan's 12-year-old son Xiao Fangzhi to Jiankang, preparing to make him emperor, and in spring 555, Xiao Fangzhi took the title Prince of Liang.\n\nAt that time, however, Emperor Wenxuan, who had previously made an unsuccessful attempt to establish Xiao Yuanming's cousin Xiao Tui (蕭退) as Liang's emperor in 553, decided to again try to establish a vassal regime in Liang. He wrote Wang, suggesting that Xiao Fangzhi was too young to be emperor and proposing Xiao Yuanming as emperor—and Xiao Yuanming apparently cooperated with Emperor Wenxuan in this attempt, as he wrote a letter to Wang as well. Wang initially wrote back to reject the offer. However, a few quick victories by Northern Qi escort forces, commanded by Emperor Wenxuan's brother Gao Huan (高渙) the Prince of Shangdang, made Wang fearful, and he wrote back, agreeing to support Xiao Yuanming as emperor—but extracting a promise from Xiao Yuanming to create Xiao Fangzhi crown prince. Wang also allowedly only 1,000 soldiers to accompany Xiao Yuanming south of the Yangtze River. In summer 555, Xiao Yuanming arrived at Jiankang, and as he saw the main gate to the palace—Zhuque Gate (朱雀門), he cried bitterly, and the Liang officials also cried bitterly. He then took the throne. Pursuant to his promise, he created Xiao Fangzhi crown prince. Wang and Chen continued to be in command of the armed forces.\n\nXiao Yuanming's reign did not last long. In fall 555, Chen Baxian, displeased with Xiao Yuanming's ascension—which he had tried to persuade Wang Sengbian not to accept—made a surprise attack on Jiankang from his post at Jingkou (京口, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). With everyone believing that Chen's army movement was in response to report that Northern Qi was planning to attack, Jiankang's defense forces made no effort to resist, and Chen surprised Wang, killing him and seizing power. Two days after Wang's death, Xiao Yuanming abdicated and moved out of the palace, returning to his private residence. Chen made Xiao Fangzhi emperor (as Emperor Jing).\n\nEmperor Jing formally made Xiao Yuanming prime minister and created him the greater title of Duke of Jian'an, although there is no evidence that Xiao Yuanming yielded much actual power.\n\nIn light of the coup, Northern Qi launched a major attack on Liang in winter 555, aided by Liang generals loyal to Wang Sengbian. The Northern Qi and Liang armies following Chen Baxian's orders stalemated for months. In summer 556, Northern Qi generals invited Xiao Yuanming to their camp for peace negotiations, and Chen sent Xiao Yuanming to the Northern Qi camp. However, before any negotiations could commence, Xiao Yuanming died from a severe infection on his back. In 558, Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia (Emperor Yuan's grandson), who was proclaimed Liang's emperor by the general Wang Lin following Chen's seizure of the throne from Emperor Jing earlier that year, honored Xiao Yuanming as Emperor Min—a posthumous name recognized by but rarely used by traditional historians.\n\n\n", "id": "7722325", "categories": ["Northern Wei people", "556 deaths", "Liang dynasty emperors", "Northern Qi people"], "title": "Xiao Yuanming"}

He became general manager of the Metropolitan Opera in Manhattan, New York City from 1935 to 1950.\n\nBorn in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Johnson was the son of James Johnson and the former Margaret Jane Brown. The young tenor sang in his local church choir and at events in the Guelph area. At a concert in Stratford, Ontario in 1897, contralto Edith Miller encouraged him to move to New York and pursue a singing career. He sang as a soloist with several church choirs in the New York area. After this period he did much concert work, touring through the Mid-West with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and singing in many Music Festivals throughout the country. After a peripatetic existence for some years, working in a variety of venues and training with several masters, he made his concert debut at Carnegie Hall in 1904.\n\nJohnson sang the lead role in the North American premiere of Oscar Straus's \"A Waltz Dream\" in 1907. In 1908 he moved to Paris, France and began training under Richard Barthélemy. He married Beatrice d'Arneiro, in London, in August 1909. His only child, Fiorenza, was born 21 December 1910. She married George Drew who later became Premier of Ontario and Federal Leader of the Opposition, and died in 1965.\n\nJohnson went to Italy in 1909, studying voice with Vincenzo Lombardi, in Florence. When singing outside North America, Johnson called himself Edoardo Di Giovanni. He made his opera debut on 10 January 1912 as Andrea Chénier at Padua's \"Teatro Verdi\". After his début in Padua, he became leading tenor at La Scala, Milan, for five consecutive seasons. In Rome he spent four seasons at the Costanzi Theatre, where, among other roles, he sang Luigi and Rinuccio in the Italian premiere of \"Il trittico\". In 1914 he sang the title role in the first performance in Italian of Richard Wagner's \"Parsifal\", under the baton of Arturo Toscanini. He sang in Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Buenos Aires. His London debut was in Gounod's \"Faust\", alongside Nellie Melba.\n\nJohnson made his North American opera debut on 20 November 1919 as Loris in Giordano's \"Fedora\" with the Chicago Opera. He remained in Chicago for three years. Johnson made his Metropolitan Opera debut on 16 November 1922, as Avito in Italo Montemezzi's \"L'amore dei tre re\". He remained with the Met for thirteen years as a singer. He notably created the title role in the world premiere of Deems Taylor's \"The King's Henchman\" in 1927. His last performance was on 20 March 1935.\n\nIn May 1935, Johnson became general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, succeeding Herbert Witherspoon, who died just six weeks into his tenure. Johnson held the position for fifteen years.\n\nJohnson retired from the Met on 15 June 1950 and was succeeded by Rudolf Bing. He returned to Guelph, promoting musical education and serving as chairman of the board of the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. He established the Edward Johnson Music Foundation, sponsor of the annual Guelph Spring Festival.\n\nHe suffered a heart attack and died while attending a National Ballet recital at the Guelph Memorial Gardens.\n\n\"If you get right down to the bottom, there are in reality not so many singing rules to learn. You sing on the five vowels, and when you can do them loudly, softly, and with mezzo voce, you have a foundation upon which to build vocal mastery. And yet some people study eight, ten years without really laying the foundation. Why should it take the singer such a long time to master the material of his equipment? A lawyer or doctor, after leaving college, devotes three or four years only to preparing himself for his profession, receives his diploma, then sets up in business. It ought not to be so much more difficult to learn to sing than to learn these other professions.\" Edward Johnson\n\"Of course the ear is the most important factor, our greatest ally. It helps us imitate. Imitation forms a large part of our study. We hear a beautiful tone; we try to imitate it; we try in various ways, with various placements, until we succeed in producing the sound we have been seeking. Then we endeavor to remember the sensations experienced in order that we may repeat the tone at will. So you see Listening, Imitation and Memory are very important factors in the student's development.\" Edward Johnson\n\"The old Italian operas cultivate the bel canto, that is—beautiful singing. Of course it is well for the singer to cultivate this first of all, for it is excellent, and necessary for the voice. But modern Italian opera portrays the real men and women of to-day, who live, enjoy, suffer, are angry and repentant. Bel canto will not express these emotions. When a man is jealous or in a rage, he will not stand quietly in the middle of the stage and sing beautiful tones.\" Edward Johnson\n\"I feel that if I have worked out a characterization, I must stick to my idea, in spite of what others say. It is my own conception, and I must either stand or fall by it. At times I have tried to follow the suggestions of this or that critic and have changed my interpretation to suit their taste. But it always rendered me self conscious, made my work unnatural and caused me speedily to return to my own conception.\" Edward Johnson\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7722710", "categories": ["Musicians from Ontario", "19th-century Canadian singers", "Canadian male singers", "20th-century opera singers", "19th-century opera singers", "People from Guelph", "Canadian Commanders of the Order of the British Empire", "Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada)", "Opera managers", "1959 deaths", "20th-century male singers", "Canadian operatic tenors", "Metropolitan Opera people", "20th-century Canadian singers", "1878 births"], "title": "Edward Johnson (tenor)"}

He was also involved in work on semiconductor diodes, which were the forerunners of the revolution in electronics brought about by the advent of solid-state semiconductor components. In 1945 he joined the National Acoustic Laboratories where he worked on the design and construction of hearing aids for children.\n\nAitchison was appointed as senior lecturer in Communications Engineering at the University of Sydney, which was the start of his 25-year teaching experience at that institution, culminating in his appointment as associate professor. His interest in solid-state physics took him to Bristol University, UK, for a year, and he also spent a year at Stanford University, California, on a Fulbright scholarship, working at the forefront of electronics research. In 1970, he accepted an offer from Macquarie University to become the founding professor of electronics and took up the post in 1971.\n\nAt Macquarie, Aitchison was hired as foundation professor of electronics. He taught this subject, with an emphasis on semiconductor physics, to advanced undergraduates and graduate students. In his teachings he emphasized understanding of principles over memorization of facts. \n\nAs a researcher, he created a state-of-the-art electronics laboratory and led several successful projects of a highly practical nature including pioneering work on the reception of satellite weather pictures that were shown every evening in Sydney's TV newscasts. In addition, he served as Head of the School of Mathematics and Physics, and as a member of Macquarie's Academic Senate.\n\nAt the School of Mathematics and Physics, Aitchison became a colleague and friend of quantum physicist John Clive Ward and he was a supporter, and active participant, of the Macquarie science reform movement.\n\nHe retired 4 July 1986.\n\n\nUniversity Research Bulletin (1982) written by The Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee, outlines initial research on talking typewriters at Macquarie University, detailing the role of the head of the Talking Typewriter Research team: Professor Ron Aitchison,(Professor of Electronics)\n\nAitchison's most cited paper, according to the ISI database, is his 1954 paper on transparent semiconducting films – which is still cited to this day.

Traditionally served in the morning with salt, onion and chili. It is consumed in Bangladesh and the eastern Indian states of Odisha , West Bengal, Assam, Tripura. It is a popular dish on the day of Pohela Boishakh or Bengali new year. It has been described in documents from 17th century. Panta bhat has more micronutrients than fresh rice. It is traditionally considered as beneficial in feverish conditions. Pakhala, a similar dish, is popular in Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. It is consumed in East and South East Asia as well. In China, it is known as Jiuniang and eaten mostly in the Sinchuan and Yunnan regions.\n\nAnthropologist Tapan Kumar Sanyal argues that proto-Australoid people of South Asia resorted the panta bhat because they cooked once a day, in the evening. During the Mughal Era, members of socio-cultural organizations performed open air concerts, the audience listening to the concert and eating traditional food, particularly \"panta bhat\". Friar Sebastian Manrique reported from his visit of Bengal in 17th century that the people of all communities, according to Manrique, were contented then with the daily meal of rice, often \"panta bhat\", salt and green vegetable (\"shak\"). The better-off elements of the society consumed ghee, butter, milk and various lacteous preparations and sweetmeats.\n\nRice researcher Mahabub Hossain of International Rice Research Institute explains that in the past, people engaged in farm work preferred bold and brown rice which is more suited for watered rice, and also provides more nutrition. But, as more people shifted to urban centers the demand for farm work, brown rice and watered rice decreased. In these times of polished rice, the popularity of rice varieties like Lal Swarna and White Swarna is often driven by their suitability for panta bhat.\n\nThere are many variations of the dish though all are made by soaking cooked rice in water overnight. Rice is boiled the usual way. Then \"phaen\" or starch is strained away. Rice is cooled in air temperature for 3–4 hours. Then cool water is added in a way that about an inch of water rises above the rice. Rice is generally covered with a light piece of fabric. 12–24 hours later panta bhat is ready. Panta bhat retains its taste for 2/3 days. The fluid portion is called amani or torani, and may be specially prepared. Care must be taken to cover the dish during the long soaking to avoid contamination.\n\nThe soaked rice is usually eaten in the morning with salt, lime, chili (either raw or roasted) and onions (sliced or whole) mostly for flavor. Panta bhat is often served with fried fish or vegetable curry or flattened rice (\"chira\"), dried cane or palm molasses (jaggery or \"gurh\") and milk curd (\"doi\"). Water is discarded before consumption. Sometimes edible oils may be added. Panta bhat or poita bhat is often garnished with mustard oil, onion, chilli, pickle, and served with shutki mach (dried fish), machher jhol (fish curry), especially shorshe Ilish (ilish cooked with mustard seeds), \"aloo bhorta\" or \"aloo pitika\" (mashed potato), begun bhorta (mashed brinjal) and other \"bhorta\" or \"pitika\" (mashed food).\n\nA similar dish consumed in the Indian states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh is known as Pakhala (also pakhal], pokhalo or pakhal bhat). It differs from panta bhat in seasoning as yoghurt is sometimes added prior to the fermentation process. Pazhedhu saadham, meaning \"old rice\", of Tamil Nadu is another variation of the dish.\n\nPanta bhat is especially popular in rural areas, generally served with salt, raw onion and green chili. It is usually served as breakfast, though noon or evening consumption is not uncommon. Panta bhat and other low nutrition food are consumed as fillers between meals. Panta bhat is one of the \"cool dishes\" popular in Bengal, meaning it helps keep cool during the summer. This cold and wet food, is suitable for summer mornings, but in winter dry foods, such as \"chira\" (flattened rice) and \"muri\" (puffed rice) are more preferred.\n\nIn Bangladesh, as well West Bengal, it is a part of the Pohela Boishakh (Bengali new year festival) festivities. On that day it is consumed as breakfast by urban people. Panta is also served at high-end eateries in Bangladesh and West Bengal on the day. Food-stalls maintained mostly by student groups on fair-grounds also serve panta-ilish. Panta bhat on Pohela Boishakh is often served with fried hilsha (\"ilish\"), and students of Pabna Science and Technology University (PUST) assaulted their student counselor for not providing panta-ilish in the Pohela Boishakh of 2014. But, the practice takes a toll on the hilsha population during the breeding season. Since 2016, Bangladesh government banned hilsha fishing and selling in the times of Pohela Boishakh, ministers started urging people to have panta without \"ilish\" and social media baceme rife with calls for panta without \"ilish\".\n\nAmong Hindu Bengalis, it is consumed during the Ranna Puja (Bengali cooking festival). During Ranna Puja, panta bhat is offered to Manasa the snake goddess along with fried vegetables, yellow pigeon peas cooked with elephant apples, curried ash gourd and fried Hilsa. On the Vijayadashami day of Durga Puja, panta bhat is offered to Durga along with soup of grass pea, fried taro leaves, machher jhol of blue perch and chutney of elephant apple for Sabarna Roy Choudhury Atchala Durga in Kolkata. In Assam, offering \"Dudh Panta\" (milk with stale water-soaked rice) is a part of the marital ritual. In Northeast India, there is a belief that taking \"painta\" or \"panta bhat\" gives the strength of a tiger. Panta bhat is also popular among slum-dwellers of Dhaka because it can be easily eaten only with salt or with an onion or a fried or green chili, without any other requirement.\n\nMost restaurants on NH34, which runs through Krishnanagar, Nadia, serve panta bhat in summer along with kasundi, mustard oil, kaffir lime, green chili, sliced onion, aloo chokha, fried red chili, Poppy seed balls, aloo jhuri bhaja, mango chutney, sour curd, and sweet paan. Nabanno Hyderabad, a Bengali-owned restaurant in Kukatpally, Hyderabad, serve panta bhat all the year round.\n\nThere are many folk rhymes and proverbs about panta bhat: \"shashuri nai nonod nai kar ba kori dar\"/\"agey khai panta bhat sheshe lepi ghar\" (lit. \"no mother-in-law, no sister-in-law, whom do I fear/ shall eat watered rice first then clean the room\"), \"maga bhat tay basi ar panta\"(lit. \"got rice begging, ask not whether stale or watered\"), \"ki katha bolbo sai/panta bhate tak dai\" (lit. \"what do I say, sour curd on watered rice), \"panta bhate noon jote na/begun poday ghee\" (lit. \"no salt in watered rice/ghee in roasted brinjal\"), \"noon ante panta phuray\" (lit. \"when salt arrives, the panta is finished\"), \"mude mai radhe na/tapta ar panta\" (lit. \"mother does not cook/so why ask hot or cold\") and \"bandir kame yash nai/panta bhate kash nai\" (lit. \"no merit in a maid's work/no fun in watered rice\").\n\nIn a study conducted by agricultural biotechnology department of the Assam Agricultural University it was concluded that cooked rice had an element that prevented the availability of minerals like iron, potassium, sodium and calcium in high quantities, and the breakdown of the nutritional inhibitor by the lactic acid bacteria increased the mineral content manifolds. According to Madhumita Barooah, one of the researchers, \"About 100 gm of cooked rice has only 3.4 mg of iron, while for the same quantity of rice fermented for 12 hours, the iron content went up to 73.91 mg. Likewise, sodium, which was 475 mg came down to 303 mg, potassium went up to 839 mg and calcium went up from 21 mg per 100 gm of cooked rice to 850 mg, after 12 hours of fermentation of the same quantity of rice.\" According to another study (ILSI 1998), fermentation improves the bioavailability of minerals such as iron and zinc as a result of phytic acid hydrolysis, and increases the content of riboflavin and vitamin B.\n\nPanta bhat has some remedial use. It is considered as a \"cold food\" by Ayurveda traditions, while boiled rice is neutral. Hence is a preferred food for children with a fever. Panta bhat also contains a small amount of alcohol as a result of fermentation. When the conditions of preparing \"panta bhat\" — keeping rice soaked overnight in water — were simulated in the laboratory, the rice was found to be inoculated with veratridine, a steroid-derived alkaloid.\n\nDespite its nutritional and remedial values, panta bhat is often contaminated, with almost 90% of the samples containing fecal coliforms with a median count of 3.9 log cfu/ml. The contamination was more in the rainy season. Numbers of fecal coliforms increased 10-fold when there was a delay of more than 4 hours between preparation and consumption; 90% of the samples were eaten more than 12 hours after preparation. Contamination increased during the rainy season. A ten-fold increase in contamination was observed between 4 hours of soaking and 16 hours of soaking. In cases of diarrhoea this stale rice is not to be served to the patient, though boiled rice and rice-water are often prescribed as diarrheal treatment.\n\n", "id": "7722811", "categories": ["Bangladeshi cuisine", "Bangladeshi fish dishes", "Rice dishes", "Assamese cuisine", "Bengali cuisine", "Bangladeshi rice dishes", "Indian rice dishes"], "title": "Panta bhat"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7722929", "text": "Weasel (Marvel Comics)\n\nWeasel (Jack Hammer) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Weasel is a friend, sidekick, information broker and arms dealer for Deadpool. Weasel is perhaps Deadpool's best friend. However, because of his frequent mood swings and tenuous mental state, Deadpool still often abuses or mistreats him. Weasel has also displayed an opportunistic streak against his friend's interests on occasions.\n\nActor T. J. Miller portrays Weasel in the 2016 feature film \"Deadpool\" and its 2018 sequel \"Deadpool 2\".\n\nCreated by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist Klaus Janson, Weasel first appeared in \"Cable\" #3 (July 1993).\n\nWeasel was once a bright young lad attending Empire State University, where he was a classmate of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. Weasel, then known by his birth name of Jack Hammer, was competing with Parker for a prestigious job under the wing of Norman Osborn and held an enormous crush on Stacy, Parker's future girlfriend. Deadpool accidentally teleported into the past during a fight with the Great Lakes Avengers. In the past, he found Jack Hammer whose future he was well aware of. Disguised as Peter Parker, Deadpool related to Norman Osborn false information about Jack Hammer being a drug user. His employment opportunity thus ruined, Hammer was manipulated by the disguised Deadpool into fixing his teleportation belt. With the gadget fixed, Deadpool returns to the future, leaving a depressed and drunken young Hammer with a new career option: crime.\n\nFrom that point on, Hammer adopted the name of Weasel and turned to a life consisting of providing intelligence, weapons and other technological devices to mercenaries and criminals, sometimes partaking in mercenary activities himself. It is during this period that Weasel (from his perspective) first met Deadpool in Canada, apparently meeting not long after Deadpool left Weapon X. Weasel quickly proved himself as an able informant and arms supplier to Deadpool and eventually came to form an uneasy friendship with him. He assisted his friend behind the scenes as Deadpool eventually came to work for a crime lord named Tolliver. After Tolliver's apparent death, the two competed against a slew of other mercenaries, villains, heroes and assassins to become the beneficiaries of Tolliver's will, and later came to work at the Hellhouse, a hotbed of mercenary activity in Chicago where jobs were dispensed to those willing to take them. Deadpool, due to his prowess and cold heart, came to be feared and respected there, but often butted heads with another powerful mercenary, T-Ray. During this time, The Taskmaster abducted Weasel in order to procure his services. Initially allowing Deadpool to track him down, then switching off his tracking device (which was attuned to his heart) shortly before Taskmaster defeated Deadpool, Weasel revealed his confusion to both mercenaries due to Taskmaster's sweetened offer in spite of the somewhat mercurial loyalties shared between himself and Deadpool. However, when his friend baffled and conclusively defeated Taskmaster, he chose to return to his employ, encouraged in part by Deadpool's show of compassion for him and the promise of a new cable connection to the Playboy Channel. Weasel tried to mention Siryn, knowing the positive influence the Irish mutant had over Deadpool. Once again he was cowed by threats of physical violence. His loyalties to Deadpool were also further shown at the Hellhouse when it became apparent that T-Ray maintained a grip of intimidation over the other mercenaries when Deadpool was absent, even though he was in no position to stand up to T-Ray directly. Ultimately, T-Ray decided to organize a showdown with Deadpool and told Weasel to relay that information to Deadpool. In an effort to get in touch with his friend before the appointed showdown time, Weasel teleported to Deadpool's San Francisco home - a definite no-no. He was shooed out by Deadpool's friend/prisoner Blind Al, but when Weasel later made repeated visits to her, Deadpool discovered him there and placed both him and Blind Al in the Box, a dark room so filled with sharp objects and instruments of torture that movement is almost impossible. This latest abuse was the breaking point - Weasel decided to move on and left Deadpool after escaping from the Box, hoping to define his life outside of his association with Deadpool.\n\nFate had other designs, however. After Deadpool's death and subsequent resurrection some time afterward, Weasel ran into an amnesiac Deadpool. He helped to restore Deadpool's memory and thus restored their friendship before leaving once more. An on-again off-again association between the two occurred after this point, with Deadpool sometimes asking for goods or working with Weasel. However, another breaking point came when Deadpool stood up for Weasel when he was found hacking into a computer. When Deadpool found out that Weasel had lied, he refused to help Weasel, who was sent to jail. Weasel decided to atone for this crime by faithfully serving his time, and when he got out, coincidentally worked a job with Deadpool in Rumekistan. With Weasel having served time to appease Deadpool's anger and with Deadpool having TiVo'd all the episodes of \"Battlestar Galactica\" during Weasel's stay in jail to make up for his past abuses, the two became fast friends once more. He assisted Deadpool in the mercenary's latest voyage of self-discovery as Deadpool put himself in a series of situations to regain his rep as a mercenary, then made another attempt to become a hero. Weasel had Deadpool shrunk down to key-ring size in order to bolster his self-confidence, as he was no less effective in his greatly reduced size. On the last of these missions, Weasel was left in a Hydra base during an attack that was an attempt to give Deadpool more street-cred. While being imprisoned on the base, Weasel was apparently able to instead join Hydra, naming himself The Pene\"traitor\", and created a teleportation machine for Hydra's use. This was interrupted by an attack on the base by Wolverine, coinciding with an attempted rescue by Deadpool and Bob, Agent of HYDRA. Deadpool and Bob were there because they knew Wolverine's attack would put Weasel's life in danger. Furthermore, Weasel's seeming joining of Hydra was a ruse; his teleportation gift simply sent the users straight to an American controlled prison. Although he is not explicitly stated to be a pet owner, Weasel takes Blind Al's dog at her request when he leaves Deadpool, and later on is shown to have a white cat in his apartment.\n\nWeasel becomes an associate of the \"good guy\" mercenary firm Agency X.\n\nWeasel returns in \"Deadpool\" vol. 2 #23 as Las Vegas hero \"The House\". He is funded by the local casinos and takes pleasure at the chance to fight Deadpool. Using his vast knowledge of Deadpool, he quickly traps and defeats him, ultimately locking Wade in his own version of the Box. Deadpool quickly and inexplicably escapes and offers Weasel a chance to double his earnings. He then takes Weasel's extra suit of armor and the alias \"Wildcard\", acting as The House's sidekick. Later, in an encounter with a new Grizzly, unbeknownst to Weasel, Deadpool secretly tells Griz about a proposition he has for him. Grizzly manages to escape, and later, when Weasel and Deadpool meet with the casino owners, Deadpool reveals that he is in fact Wildcard, much to Weasel's fury. Later, Wade persuades Weasel to switch suits so that all the praise Wildcard gets will be for Weasel's good deeds. Weasel agrees to the plan, and the two once again face off with Grizzly, now back again and attempting to steal the millions of dollars in the casino's counting room. In the ensuing battle, Weasel fights Grizzly in the Wildcard suit while Deadpool sips drinks as The House. Unfortunately, everyone thinks Weasel is the one in The House suit drinking Lime Rickey's, and worst of all, Deadpool runs off with Grizzly and the cash. So when Deadpool tells the casino bosses that Weasel took off with the money because he wasn't getting any respect, they all believe him. They also believe him when he tells them that Weasel will be returning first thing in the morning. Meanwhile, Weasel talks on the phone with Blind Al, seeking advice, and resolves to take Deadpool down, against Blind Al's protests, and then spots an explosion in the distance. As it turns out, the explosion was caused by Deadpool, back at the casino with Grizzly and attempting to rob the vault. While Grizzly heads for the vault himself, Weasel arrives in the Wildcard suit and confronts Deadpool (who is still in The House's suit). In a parody of \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Deadpool asks Weasel to join him. Weasel refuses and seemingly kills Deadpool by blowing his head off. Grizzly ends up being locked in the casino vault, though he still has the money. The casino owners still think that Weasel was the one in The House suit, so everyone ends up cheering for him as Grizzly is arrested. Later, in his lair, Weasel converses again with Blind Al, who insists that he tell the casino bosses the truth. Weasel is skeptical, but Blind Al reminds him about the possibility that they could have found Deadpool's body by now. Weasel then receives a call from the casino owners who reveal that they found no body. Deadpool shows up and explains that he snuck out of the suit under cover of the smoke from the explosion, and that the money in the casino vault was actually counterfeit money with his face on it. Weasel assumes that Deadpool will kill him, but Deadpool says that he won't, that he will help Weasel out of his jam, that he will take over the Wildcard suit, and that Weasel will have to lie low. When Weasel asks where he will go, Deadpool replies \"I think we both know the answer to that one, buddy...\" Later, when Deadpool meets with the casino owners, they claim that he said he'd taken care of Weasel. When they ask him how, he replies, \"I put him in a Box.\"\n\nWeasel is later freed from the Box by Macho Gomez, who recruits him to his team of people who were screwed over by, and want revenge on, Deadpool, and they confront him in Bob, Agent of HYDRA's garage. In the ensuing battle, Weasel begins to have second thoughts, saying to himself, \"Stupid, stupid, stupid--I never shoulda come here! Deadpool's gonna do somethin' horrible to me, I know it!\" to which Deadpool responds from across the room, \"Hey, Weasel! Come over here so I can do something horrible to you!\" Fortunately for Weasel, the team (minus Sluggo, whom Weasel inadvertently killed) managed to defeat Deadpool, and Weasel and the others left unscathed. But since they did not actually kill him, Deadpool managed to come back, and kill Weasel as payback for joining Macho Gomez.\n\nAfter his death, Weasel was condemned to Hell, which he escapes from with the help of Mephisto. Rechristening himself Patient Zero, he then sets out to get revenge on both Deadpool and Peter Parker, hiring the former to assassinate the latter after making it look like torturous human experimentation was being conducted at Parker Industries, which Patient Zero also steals data from for use in transforming captured homeless people into \"Manstrosities\". After the Manstrosities are defeated in a confrontation with Spider-Man and Deadpool, Patient Zero splices the two heroes' DNA into another test subject, turning her into Itsy Bitsy, a psychotic vigilante with the combined powers of both Deadpool and Spider-Man. When his creation turns on him, a desperate Patient Zero reaches out to Spider-Man and Deadpool for aid, and is killed in front of them by Itsy Bitsy.\n\nPatient Zero is then returned to Hell, and eventually visited by Deadpool, to whom he reveals his identity, explaining that he was motivated by Deadpool's past abuse and the belief that Deadpool has not changed, and has tricked the world into believing that deep down he is nothing more than \"a scum-ridden murdering psychopath.\"\n\nWeasel is afterward shown being offered another deal by Mephisto. This one involving Deadpool.\n\nJack Hammer has no superpowers but he is an expert hacker and inventor with a genius-level intellect and knowledge of many weapons.\n\n\nWeasel appears as a non-playable associate of Deadpool in the video game \"\", voiced by Cam Clarke. He is part of a subplot to discover if Nick Fury's second-in-command, Black Widow, is a S.H.I.E.L.D. traitor and requires information gathered by the player in between the missions to help him work, such as passwords named after other characters, other hackers likely to assist him, or suitable hiding places to avoid being found by S.H.I.E.L.D. In the Sanctum Sanctorum, Weasel asks the players if he would be able to hide out at the Baxter Building or the X-Mansion. As Hank Pym states that Mister Fantastic tends to work with S.H.I.E.L.D, The heroes tell Weasel to hide out at the X-Mansion since Professor X stated that S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents on X-Mansion grounds would not sit well with the X-Men. Later on in Asgard, he develops a crush on Valkyrie, who prefers Deadpool and his sense of humor. Deadpool states to Valkyrie that Weasel has that way with women ever since he brought his cousin to the prom. Storm mentions to the players about how some of the X-Men got annoyed with Weasel activating different vehicles and equipment without their authorization. A phone call made during the credits reveal that the Black Widow had been using Weasel to steal information from S.H.I.E.L.D. then setting up Weasel for the fall. As can be expected, he has unique dialogue with Deadpool revealing that Weasel had recently been discharged from the hospital after he and Deadpool fought over cheese puffs and Deadpool stabbed him in the leg.\n\n", "id": "7722929", "categories": ["Comic book sidekicks", "Characters created by Fabian Nicieza", "Characters created by Klaus Janson", "Comics characters introduced in 1993"], "title": "Weasel (Marvel Comics)"}

It was the fifth episode of series 1, and was first broadcast on 6 October 1981. In the episode, Del acquires an old double decker bus and decides to give tours around London.\n\nAs Rodney invites his girlfriend to the flat, Del Boy gives him a job as a nocturnal security officer (an NSO) within new security company \"Trotter Watch\" (TW). As Rodney is sent to guard a bus depot, Del frightens him by whistling along with him from afar.\n\nThe next morning at Nelson Mandela House, as Grandad tells Del that he used to be a security officer during the war, Rodney is woken up just to hear Del's latest get-rich-quick scheme: Trotters Ethnic Tours. Rodney will drive the bus, Del will be the tour guide, and Grandad will send the leaflets to every part of London.\n\nThe next day, while the tour bus is ready to go, nobody has turned up at the moment, but Del bets Grandad £50 that the tourists \"will\" show up. Throughout the day, Del tells Rodney and Grandad that he will take the tourists to the house where Sherlock Holmes was born, and to North London where Jack the Ripper was \"buried\".\n\nAfter a while, Del stands on the top floor of the bus and explains to Rodney and Grandad his dream to become a millionaire. He claims to have had a vision in which he sees himself standing on the balcony of a tower block, with the initials of his company in giant flashing lights. As soon as Rodney points out that Trotters Independent Traders spells out \"TIT\", Del decides to just give up and go home.\n\nAs the Trotters get back to Nelson Mandela House, Del finds out the real reason why nobody came: Grandad threw all the leaflets in the rubbish chute. Enraged, Del threatens him with violence and Rodney starts chasing after his brother, trying to calm him down.\n\n\nAccording to John Sullivan, he got the idea for the script from his father's favourite pub called the \"Duke of Devonshire\". The man who ran it was even called Boycie. The place suffered from terrible business, but the owner explained it was \"Ethnic English\" thus the idea was implanted in Sullivan's mind.\n\nRock Spectrum : Layback\n\nRonnie Hazlehurst: \"Original Theme Tune\" \n\nNote: In the original series 1 broadcasts of Only Fools and Horses, the theme tune was very different to the version adopted from series 2, which became the standard version known today.

This tune was replaced in series 2 with a version written and sung by John Sullivan. After the initial run of series 1, all future re-runs replaced the Hazlehurst version with John Sullivan's to match the other series.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7723161", "text": "Honda RC212V\n\nThe Honda RC212V is a Japanese road racing motorcycle developed to race in the MotoGP series. Officially introduced on 30 October 2006 as the RC211V replacement in the MotoGP series, it was developed by Honda Racing Corporation \"(HRC)\" throughout 2006 and began officially racing in the 2007 season.\n\nThe model name designates the following:\n\nThe RC212V features an liquid-cooled four-stroke DOHC 4-valve V4 to power the all new chassis built with mass centralization and handling as top priority.\n\nDani Pedrosa and Nicky Hayden rode the factory-backed versions, while the customer machines were ridden by Marco Melandri, Toni Elías, Carlos Checa, and Shinya Nakano. A perennial issue with Honda's GP motorcycle is which team and rider receives the best parts and whether performance differences are due to the rider not the machine. Before the racing season started in 2007, Melandri was quoted as saying, \"\"In the past few tests I've seen a big progression with Pedrosa's bike, but we're still waiting for new parts from Honda.\"\"\n\nAfter a few rounds, Honda riders did not achieve the results expected, leading HRC chief Satoru Horiike to admit that they made a mistake in the motorcycle's development. Melandri decided to ride with the Ducati team in 2008 and Pedrosa's dissatisfaction led to rumors that he was leaving Honda. Towards the end of 2007, however, there were signs of improvement, with the Repsol Honda team taking the last five pole positions of the season and Pedrosa winning the last round at Valencia.\n\nFor 2008, HRC planned to use pneumatic valve springs and an all-new chassis. The mass centralization of the 2007 model was thought to have gone too far, and instead the 2008 model is more open, reducing heat and improving balance. The factory team riders are Pedrosa (through 2009) and Hayden (through 2008). Satellite team riders are Nakano, Andrea Dovizioso, Randy de Puniet and Alex de Angelis.\nThe 2008 pneumatic valve version has only been available to the Repsol Honda team, and in pre-season testing it has been highly problematic. The original intent of running an all-new engine and chassis was shelved when the engine did not perform to expectations. Pedrosa and Hayden then tested a 2007 engine in a 2008 chassis, and after still being near the bottom of testing timesheets, the Repsol Honda team used the 2007 version in the first round’s practice for comparison purposes. For the race, Pedrosa chose a revised 2008 chassis while Hayden chose the 2007. The pneumatic engine was race-debuted by Hayden at the Donington round, and he was charged with developing the new engine for the rest of the season (Pedrosa deciding to continue using the conventional valve engine). An electronic problem at the subsequent Assen round caused Hayden to run out of fuel just before the line, allowing Colin Edwards to come around him and take the remaining podium position.\n\nAt the 13th round it was announced that Pedrosa would switch to Bridgestone tires for the remainder of the season, and he also planned to start racing the pneumatic valved engine in the 14th round at Indianapolis.\n\nUnlike the other Honda teams, de Puniet's Team LCR used Öhlins suspension instead of Showa.\n\nFor 2009, the factory team riders were Pedrosa and Dovizioso, and the satellite team riders were Elías, De Angelis, de Puniet and Yuki Takahashi; Elías was given a factory spec machine. The 2009 model was largely the same as the 2008. All 6 of the RC212Vs used pneumatic valve engines.\n\nAfter two rounds the Repsol Honda riders had only achieved a single podium. Vice president of HRC, Shuhei Nakamoto, said \"\"If Dani does not win the world championship it is Honda’s responsibility, not Dani’s,\"\" while Pedrosa said \"\"I’ve spoken to (Nakamoto) but I’ve spoken to many people like him, but it seems like it’s three years of the same story. What I really need is to see is some things coming, not always just hearing, talking, or a meeting. I’d like to have something where I can say okay, thank you, this is good.\"\"\nBefore Round 6 at Catalunya, Dovizioso expressed frustration that Pedrosa would be given priority in the post-race test, feeling that the Spaniard's poor physical condition would not lead to a productive evaluation. In the race, Dovizioso finished in 4th place and Pedrosa in 6th, and Pedrosa announced he would skip the test to rest. Using the new chassis, Dovizioso was top rider of the test.\n\nIn practice at Round 7 at Assen Pedrosa remarked that the new chassis was an improvement in braking and stability, but both Pedrosa and Dovizioso crashed in the race at the same turn. At the following round at Laguna Seca, Pedrosa won the race, while Dovizioso crashed out.\n\nIn post-race testing at Brno, the Repsol team tested Öhlins suspension components, which until then had been using Showa. For the San Marino round, Dovizioso will use Öhlins and Pedrosa will use Showa suspension.\n\nThe 2009 season ended with three wins for the Repsol Honda team—two for Pedrosa and one for Dovizioso—and a 2nd place in the constructor championship for Honda. At post-race testing at Valencia, Pedrosa tested Öhlins suspension exclusively, and the factory team tried a new chassis and swingarm. Pedrosa and Dovizioso had the 3rd and 6th fastest times over the three-day test.\n\nFor 2010, the factory team riders are Pedrosa and Dovizioso, and the satellite team riders are Hiroshi Aoyama, de Puniet, Melandri and Marco Simoncelli. All riders are using Öhlins suspension components this year. The electronic systems were given an update, and the bike is shorter with a higher center of gravity. Also, Honda hired Andre Zugna and Cristian Battaglia, formerly Yamaha race engineers, and Carlo Luzzi, formerly Jorge Lorenzo’s telemetry technician at Yamaha.\n\nAccording to one analysis of pre-season tests at Sepang and Qatar, Dovizioso’s average placing in the tests was third, while Pedrosa’s was ninth. Pedrosa complained of problems with the suspension and chassis, and at the first race of the season in Qatar, Dovizioso finished third, while Pedrosa finished in seventh place. Pedrosa experienced speed wobbles down the front straight, and Honda determined that they had committed a mistake in the design of the chassis, and that by trying to make the bike easier to ride, they made it too flexible.\n\nBy the following round at Jerez, Pedrosa had a new chassis and finished the race in second place and Dovizioso finished in sixth; in the test after the race, Pedrosa finished fastest and Dovizioso fifth, using a new swingarm that Pedrosa used in the race, and also a new chassis. Pedrosa later said and Honda confirmed that a fuel sensor problem slowed down the RC212V in the final laps and may have cost him the victory at Jerez.\n\nAt the third round at Le Mans, Dovizioso finished the race in third and Pedrosa in fifth, the latter getting passed in the last lap by Dovizioso and Hayden and later reporting problems with the rear brake. Melandri had switched back to Showa suspension and finished in sixth place. At the fourth round at Mugello, Pedrosa won the race, Dovizioso finished third and Melandri finished fifth. Pedrosa used a 2009 model rear shock. During first practice at the 14th round at Motegi, the throttle cable stuck and caused Pedrosa to crash and break his collarbone, causing him to miss the race and putting him out of contention for the championship. At the 16th round in Australia, Dovizioso's steering damper had a problem, forcing him to retire from the race. The season ended with Honda placing second in the MotoGP constructor championship with 342 points, 62 points behind first-place Yamaha and 56 points ahead of third-place Ducati.\n\nFor 2011 the factory supported riders were Andrea Dovizioso, Dani Pedrosa, Casey Stoner, and Marco Simoncelli while the satellite supported riders were Hiroshi Aoyama and Toni Elías. Honda riders dominated pre-season testing. Frame geometry and rigidity are the same as the previous year, making the 2011 bike an evolution of the 2010 version. One of the improvements to the 2011 machine is a \"seamless transmission\". Stoner and Dovizioso chose to use the 2011 chassis, while Pedrosa decided to stay with the more flexible 2010 version.\n\nAfter the third round at Estoril, Dovizioso began to use a new clutch designed to reduce hopping under braking.\n\nHonda won the manufacturer's championship with 13 wins between Stoner's ten and Pedrosa's three, and never finished lower than second in race results. The factory RC212V was retired at the end of the season to make way for the 2012 RC213V, though leased models will still be raced by satellite teams.\n\nTitles Won<br>\nRiders: 2011 (Casey Stoner)<br>\nConstructers: 2011\n\nRaces won<br>\nTotal: 24<br>\n2011: Stoner 10, Pedrosa 3 <br>\n2010: Pedrosa 4 <br>\n2009: Pedrosa 2, Dovizioso 1 <br>\n2008: Pedrosa 2 <br>\n2007: Pedrosa 2 <br>\n2006: Pedrosa 2 <br>\n<br>\nPoles<br>\nTotal: 11<br>\n2011: Stoner 12, Pedrosa 3 <br>\n2010: Pedrosa 4, Dovizioso 1 <br>\n2009: Pedrosa 2 <br>\n2008: Pedrosa 2 <br>\n2007: Pedrosa 5, Hayden 1\n\n", "id": "7723161", "categories": ["Honda motorcycles", "Grand Prix motorcycles"], "title": "Honda RC212V"}

It tells the story of the arrival of a new boy, Barry, in the sixth form of an English private school.\n\nThe school is never named in the novel, but a host of clues (most tellingly the school motto) reveals the school to be Sutcliffe's alma mater, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, a fact that was picked up at the time by the British broadsheet press.\n\nThe book is set in 1986 and is narrated by a Jewish student at the school, Mark, who does not have much success with girls. He finds himself drawn to Barry, who is incredibly handsome. The two become friends, and the book tells of the course of just over a year during which Barry discovers sex with girls and has an affair with a teacher. Mark struggles with his attraction to Barry, but has a relationship with Barry's sister, Louise. Barry, meanwhile, realises that he is, in fact, gay, and enters into a relationship with Mark's brother, Dan, which Mark is unaware of. The four all go on holiday together, and Dan and Barry tell Mark of their relationship. He reacts badly, and accuses them of not being normal. This leads to Barry storming off and Louise dumping Mark. Mark and Barry do have a rapprochement of sorts at the end of the book, but their friendship is over. Mark ends the book contending that he can't be homophobic, because he made it up with his brother.\n\nThe book was adapted for the stage by Russell Labey, and performed at the 2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It staged a major revival in April 2008 at the Tabard Theatre which subsequently led to a West End production at the Trafalgar Studios in London in March and April 2009, starring Nicholas Hoult as Mark.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7723284", "text": "Dry fly fishing\n\nDry fly fishing is an angling technique in which the lure is an artificial fly which floats on the surface of the water and does not get wet. Developed originally for trout fishing, it is sometimes regarded as the supreme fishing sport, owing to its difficulty in both manual dexterity and understanding of the fish in its environment. However it is also enjoyable and is widely practised.\n\nFly fishing for trout is a popular sport, which can be done using various methods with the appropriate types of flies. Trout mostly feed near the bed of the stream, where wet flies and especially nymphs are used. They typically only come to the surface to feed when there is a large bug hatch during which thousands of aquatic insects grow wings and leave the water to mate and lay eggs. Particularly during the summer months and on smaller mountain streams, trout also often feed on terrestrial insects such as ants, beetles and grasshoppers when they fall onto the water surface. It is on these surface-feeding occasions that the dry fly can be an effective lure.\n\nAt certain times, Salmon will also rise to a fly on the surface and dry flies may also be used to fish for them.\n\nThe aim of dry-fly fishing is to mimic the downstream drifting of a real fly on the surface of the water. To be successful it requires both manual skill and a good knowledge of the fish and its surroundings. It is also a pleasurable occupation on a slow, dreamy Summer's day. Because of this it gained a reputation as the aristocrat of angling sports, superior to all other kinds of angling. Consequently, good trout streams command a premium price.\n\nDry fly fishing uses a line and flies that float. They are joined by a fine 3 to 5 meters long leader, typically of nylon monofilament line, which is tapered so that it is nearly invisible where the fly is knotted, and the angler can replace the last meter or so of nylon as required. \n\nMost of a trout's food is carried to it on the current, so they tend to face upstream with their attention focused into the current. Trout fishermen therefore prefer to begin downstream of the fish's suspected lie and work upstream into the current. Trout can see a wide area around them, so the angler must stay not only downstream of the fish, but also as low to the ground and as far from the bank as possible, moving upstream with stealth.\n\nTrout tend to strike their food at current \"edges\", where faster- and slower-moving waters mix. Obstructions to the stream flow, such as large rocks or nearby pools, provide a \"low energy\" environment where fish sit and wait for food without expending much energy. Casting upstream to the edge of the slower water, the angler can see the fly land and drift slowly back downstream. \nThe fly should land softly, as if dropped onto the water, with the leader fully extended from the fly line.\n\nThe challenge in stream fishing is to place the fly with deadly accuracy, within inches of a protective rock for instance, to mimic the behaviour of a real fly. When done properly, the fly appears to be just floating along in the current with a \"perfect drift\" as if not connected to the fly line. The angler must remain vigilant for the \"take\" in order to be ready to raise the rod tip and set the hook.\n\nDue to rivers having faster and slower currents often running side by side, the fly can overtake or be overtaken by the line, thus disturbing the fly's drift. Mending is a technique whereby one lifts and moves the part of the line that requires re-aligning with the fly's drift, thus extending the drag free drift. The mend can be upstream or downstream depending on the currents carrying the line or fly. To be effective, any mending of the fly line should not disturb the natural drift of the fly. Learning to mend is often much easier if the angler can see the fly.\n\nUnlike wet fly fishing, the \"take\" on a dry fly is visible, explosive and exciting. Right from the beginning, anglers often prefer dry fly fishing because of the relative ease of detecting a strike and the instant gratification of seeing a trout strike their fly. Nymph fishing may be more productive, but dry fly anglers can become addicted to the surface strike.\n\nOnce a fish has been caught and landed, the fly may be wet and no longer float well. Flies can sometimes be dried by \"false\" casting back and forth in the air. With care, a small piece of reusable absorbent towel, an amadou patch or a Chamois leather may be used. A used dry fly which refuses to float may be replaced with another similar or identical fly while the original dries out more thoroughly, rotating through a set of flies. After drying a fly may need a fresh application of water-repellent fly \"dressing\" liquid.\n\nA dry fly is designed to land softly on the surface of the water without breaking it and becoming wetted. It need not be inherently buoyant. They are often oiled or treated with another water repellent. Dry flies are generally considered to be freshwater flies.\n\nA dry fly may be of the imitation or attractor type. Imitations typically represent the adult form of an aquatic or terrestrial insect, such as the elk hair caddis, a caddisfly imitation. The small blue winged olive is another common fly, for which several imitators have been designed. A beginner may wish to begin with a fly that is easier to see, such as the Royal Wulff attractor or a mayfly imitation such as a parachute adams. The \"parachute\" on the parachute adams helps the fly to land as softly as a natural on the water and has the added benefit of making the fly very visible from the surface. Being able to see the fly easily is helpful to the beginner. \n\nA translucent fly seen from underneath with sunlight shining through it looks very different to a fly when out of the sun. Some dry flies, especially imitators, are especially designed to mimic this effect. J. W. Dunne developed a technique of painting the shaft of the hook white and wrapping it in translucent artificial silk, which he then oiled.\n\nSalmon flies, such as the Parks' Salmonfly, are usually larger than trout flies.\n\nDry fly fishing first became a serious sport in the 19th century, with the publication by Frederic M. Halford of two books: \"Floating Flies and How to Dress Them\" and \"Dry-Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice\". His artificials were designed to imitate real flies but they only did so under limited conditions. This led J. W. Dunne to develop a theory of trout vision, and from it a series of imitators intended for use in sunny weather, which he published in 1924 as \"Sunshine and the Dry Fly\".\n\nMeanwhile G. E. M. Skues had begun promoting wet nymph fishing. He went on to popularise the use of attractors, designed to goad the fish rather than to fool it. Skues' approach outraged the traditionalists who favoured the dry fly and in 1938 the Flyfishers' Club staged what amounted to an inquisition hearing against him. However Skues' approach proved more effective in the majority of situations.\n\nDry fly fishing has remained a popular sport.\n\n", "id": "7723284", "categories": ["Recreational fishing", "Fly fishing"], "title": "Dry fly fishing"}

He was a key figure in the development and implementation of government policies affecting cities, particularly during the Whitlam Government.\n\nStretton was born in Cambrai Private Hospital, St Kilda East. He was educated at Mentone Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne for his secondary school years. He subsequently enrolled at the University of Melbourne for his undergraduate education. However, the ongoing Second World War interrupted his studies and he served in the Royal Australian Navy. He enlisted as a rating on 5 May 1943 having declined a commission. Stretton was posted to numerous supply depots and ships throughout his service, including HMAS Penguin in Sydney and two corvettes based out of Darwin. As a result of his, he did not complete his studies at Melbourne.\n\nUpon his demobilisation on 8 February 1946, he successfully enrolled as a Rhodes Scholar to study history at the University of Oxford. His application was supported by Sir Robert Menzies who wrote highly of him.\n\nHe graduated Oxford with a Bachelor of Arts in 1948 and became a fellow in history at Balliol College. During this time, he also spent a year tutoring and reading history at Princeton University.\n\nStretton remained at the College until he took up a position as Professor of History at the University of Adelaide in 1954, becoming the youngest professor in Australia at the time. He stepped down from this position in 1968 and was appointed Visiting Research Fellow with the University's Department of Economics. Upon his retirement from the University in 1989, he was awarded both with the title of emeritus professor of history and an honorary doctorate.\n\nHe taught modern history and economics but wrote chiefly about town planning, housing policies, and social scientists' ways of explaining complex historical processes. He served as the deputy chair of the South Australian Housing Trust for 17 years at the behest of then-South Australian Premier Don Dunstan.\n\nStretton published several books on a wide range of topics. His first, \"The Political Sciences\", was published in 1969 during his tenure as a Visiting Research Fellow at the Australian National University. He put forward ideas on the importance of urban development for the economic development of Australia which were heavily influenced by his study and personal experience of the National Capital Development Commission.\n\nOne of Stretton's first and best-known works, \"Ideas for Australian Cities\", was privately published in 1970. It was widely-read and stirred considerable interest in the ideas that he presented.\n\nStretton argued that the Australian suburb, much denigrated among professional architects and planners, was preferable to the agglomeration of large metropolises. He stressed its social benefits and smaller scale for creating a sense of community. He sought to approach urban issues from a historical and sociological perspective rather than a purely modernist or technical focus. He postulated that diversity of people within a city was essential for a successful living environment. However, he did not consider that increasing density was the best way to achieve this goal due to the loss of vegetation and social cohesion that he considered important.\n\nBecause of his background in sociology and history, he was an early modern advocate of concepts now considered part of post-modernist planning methods. This included social considerations such as planning for children and encounter. He was able to tie in these ideas with his main contentions on the advantages of suburbs to health and wellbeing.\n\nAt the time of the book's publication Australia was undergoing significant social and political change, culminating in the election of the socially-progressive Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister of Australia in 1972. Stretton was employed as a consultant to both state and federal governments over the period of the Whitlam Government's term and eventually worked with the newly established Department of Urban and Regional Development. This allowed him to have a significant impact on urban policies of the Whitlam Government over the course of his term in office.\n\nHugh Stretton died after a long illness 18 July 2015, aged 91. His passing was mourned in many Australian newspapers, academic journals and other publications, with the Sydney Morning Herald calling him \"one of Australia's leading public intellectuals\".\n\nHis work had a profound effect on discourse in Australia across many different fields. His writing, activism and teaching are credited with raising important contemporary issues and leading important public debates across many decades.

Today, he works as a video journalist for the central Swiss television station Tele Tell.\n\nRitlers was born in the canton of Valais. He went to the local primary school in his place of birth, Naters. Because of bullying, he was forced to change to a school in Brig. In his free time he often assisted his father in his work, who was a foreman, wanting to follow his father's profession when older. During his apprenticeship as a mason, he learnt that he had an allergy to cement and had to quit the course.\n\nBut he discovered his passion for photography and began photographing everything that crossed his way. He moved to Lucerne as it was one of the few locations where photography apprenticeships were offered. When Ritler accidentally photographed a film set producing an army propaganda film for the Swiss national exhibition \"Expo 64\", the paper \"Blick\" became interested in hiring Ritler as a journalist. The chief editor of the time, Werner Schollenberger, invited Ritler to write for the paper. Ritler was hesitant due to the reputation of \"Blick\" as a tabloid. He eventually accepted the job offer for one year only initially. Eventually he would work for \"Blick\" for forty years.\n\nThe journalist managed to become something of an intermediary between the more conservative people of central Switzerland and the modern Zurich team of \"Blick\". Ritler's character attracted a considerably amount of curiosity and trouble; on occasion he was chased by farmers with pitchforks, his tyres were slit, he received death threats and for a while was only able to work under police protection.\n\nOne of Ritler's attributes is his curiosity for the \"people behind the headlines\", such as in the case of the chainsaw vigilante where Ritler was keen to find out more about the person behind the story.\n\nRitler was only interested in real news. Because of that, he often held interviews after conferences, not during. When the Kapellbrücke was on fire, Ritler was there.\n\nAt the age of 64, Ritler was retired early (one year before the regular Swiss retirement age) and had to leave \"Blick\". He had a number of job offers and finally accepted the offer of Tele Tell, where he is now working as a video-journalist.\n\nFor the first time, Ritler is working for TV. Within this young team, Ritler has a reputation for being a \"total professional who knows central Switzerland like no one else\" and who has an \"eye for the perfect picture\".\n\n\n", "id": "7723294", "categories": ["Swiss television journalists", "1939 births"], "title": "Josef Ritler"}

During the ceremony he preached a sermon which said that it was the monarch's duty to maintain the established religion of Scotland and to bring the other religions in Britain into conformity with it. Douglas assisted in the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and afterwards was offered the bishopric of Edinburgh if he would accept the introduction of episcopacy into Scotland. He refused, and was latterly simply Pastor of Greyfriars Kirk in Edinburgh and then Minister of the Parish of Pencaitland until his death.\n\nHe was son of George Douglas, governor of Laurence, Lord Oliphant; the father was said to be an illegitimate son of Sir George Douglas of Lochleven, brother of Sir William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton. He was educated at the University of St Andrews, where he took the degree of M.A. in 1614.\n\nHe became minister of Kirkaldy in 1628, and a year later was offered a charge at South Leith, which he declined. He became chaplain to one of the brigades of Scottish auxiliaries sent with the connivance of Charles I to the aid of Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War. Gustavus landed in Germany in June 1630; Robert Wodrow, in his ‘Analecta,’ gives several anecdotes, showing how he appreciated Douglas's advice. Returning to Scotland, he was elected in 1638 member of the General Assembly, and in the following year was chosen for the second charge of the High Church in Edinburgh. In 1641 he was removed to the Tolbooth Church, and in July of the same year preached a sermon before the Scottish parliament. In the following year he was chosen moderator of the general assembly—a post he also held in 1645, 1647, 1649, and 1651—and in 1643 he was named one of the commissioners of the Westminster Assembly.\n\nIn 1644 he was chaplain to one of the Scottish regiments in England, an account of which he gives in his ‘Diary.’ In 1649 he was retransferred to the High Church, and with other commissioners presented the Solemn League and Covenant to the parliament, and was appointed a commissioner for visiting the universities of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and St Andrews. In the following year he was one of the ministers who waited on Charles II at Dunfermline to obtain his signature to a declaration of religion; but as this document reflected on his father, Charles refused to sign it. The result was a division in the Scotch church on the matter, Douglas being a leader of the resolutioners, the party which preferred to treat the king leniently. In January 1651 Douglas officiated at the coronation of Charles II at Scone, preaching a sermon in which he said that it was the king's duty to maintain the established religion of Scotland, and to bring the other religions of the kingdom into conformity with it.\n\nDouglas was sent prisoner to London by Oliver Cromwell, when he suppressed the Scotch royalists, but was released in 1653. In 1654 he was called to London with other eminent ministers to consult with the Protector on the affairs of the Church of Scotland. Douglas was now the acknowledged leader of the moderate presbyterians or ‘public resolutioners,’ and retained the position till the English Restoration, which he largely helped to bring about. In 1659 he joined with the other resolutioners in sending James Sharp to London to attend to the interests of the Scottish church, and Wodrow (\"Sufferings of the Church of Scotland\") gives most of the correspondence which took place between them. In this year Douglas preached the sermon at the opening of Heriot's Hospital. \n\nAfter the Restoration Douglas was offered the bishopric of Edinburgh if he would agree to the introduction of episcopacy into Scotland, but declined the office, and remonstrated with Sharp for accepting the archbishopric of St. Andrews. He preached before the Scottish parliament in 1661, and 27 June 1662 was removed to the pastorate of Greyfriars Kirk. For declining to recognise episcopacy Douglas was deprived of this charge on 1 October 1662. \n\nIn 1669 the privy council licensed him as an indulged minister to the parish of Pencaitland in East Lothian. He died in 1674, aged 80.\n\nHis published works are:\n\n\nHe married (1) Margaret Kirkaldie, and (2) Margaret Boyd on 20 August 1646. By the former he was father of Thomas, Janet, Alexander, minister of Logie Kirk, Elizabeth, Archibald, and Robert. He had also two children (Robert and Margaret) by his second wife.\n", "id": "7723397", "categories": ["17th-century Scottish people", "Ministers of the Church of Scotland", "1594 births", "1594 in Scotland", "Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland", "1674 deaths", "Scottish Commissioners at the Westminster Assembly"], "title": "Robert Douglas (minister)"}

Aunty Genoa was born on the island of Oʻahu in the Kakaʻako district of Honolulu and grew up in Lā'ie. She was an icon in Hawaiian music and a mainstay on the Hawaiian music scene for more than 60 years. She captivated local and visitor audiences alike. She had a tremendous repertoire of traditional Hawaiian standards and Hapa Haole tunes. Many local artists include Aunty Genoa Keawe among their many influences.\n\nIn 2005, she received an honorary doctorate (Doctor of Humane Letters) from the University of Hawai‘i.\n\nGenoa Leilani Adolpho's early years were full of moving about. She was born in 1918 in Kakaako in a stable. In her childhood her family moved about several occasions. Before she was ten years old she'd already lived on Kauai for several years and had moved back to Kakaako. By the time she was about 10 years old, her family had moved to Laie.\n\nThis move to Laie would help facilitate the phenomenal music career that would highlight her life. Aunty Genoa always loved to sing ever since she was a little girl. In Laie she received her early musical training as a member of a local LDS Church choir. It was in choir that she built up her repertoire, knowledge and appreciation of music. She attended school until the 8th grade. She and her husband, the late Edward Puniwai Keawe-Aiko, whom she married in 1935, had twelve children.\n\nKeawe was a lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nShe began performing music professionally prior to World War II at officers' clubs and at bandstand shows in Kailua. Eventually Aunty Genoa landed a radio show on KULA singing with John Kameaaloha Almeida. Much like most other musicians, Aunty Genoa could not make a living solely on music. She also made money in her early years as a lei seller and as a taxi driver.\n\nHer long and illustrious musical career had taken her throughout the islands and around the world. She had played at luaus, lounges, bars, and on numerous radio and television shows.\n\nAunty Genoa had taken great pride in preserving \"na mea Hawaii\". She learned to speak Hawaiian through her mother-in-law, who spoke Hawaiian as her first language, and became a fluent native-speaker (the term for someone who has learned Hawaiian from someone who speaks it as their first language instead of learning it in school). She arguably has perhaps the widest repertoire of traditional Hawaiian meles. Like many old-time Hawaiian singers and musicians she plays her music by ear.\n\nShe had been recording music professionally since 1946. Her original record label was with the 49th State Hawaii record company. She then went on to record with Hula Records. After a falling out with the company she founded her own record label, Genoa Keawe Records, to record her music and the music of her family and friends. Along with the band, who had often been known as Aunty Genoa's Hawaiians, she helped to perpetuate Hawaiian music.\n\nKeawe is a recipient of a 2000 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.\n\nFollowing years of health complications, Genoa Keawe, died in the morning of February 25, 2008, at the age of 89.\n\n", "id": "7723474", "categories": ["Latter Day Saints from Hawaii", "20th-century American musicians", "Hawaiian music", "Native Hawaiian musicians", "1918 births", "2008 deaths"], "title": "Genoa Keawe"}

It is the last stage of school education. To sit for the exam, students are required to finish 2 years of pre-school education, 10 years of basic education, and 2 years of secondary academic or vocational education(tawjihi year). Subjects in the exam include Arabic, English, Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Civil Studies and Islamic studies (unless Christian). \n\nOnly those who pass the exam with a good mark may apply to proceed to university. For example, to be accepted to study medicine you must take the scientific stream in the last 2 years of the secondary education and get a mark not less than 85 degree out of 100 in Tawjihi exam. \n\nForeign secondary education programs such as GCE/IGCSE/GCSE, SATs, and International Baccalaureate require to have Tawjihi-equivalency, so that the student could later work in Jordan or proceed to a higher education in Jordan.\n\nUpon graduation, the ministry of Higher Education transforms the Grades/Marks of these foreign educational programs, into the same marks used in grading Tawjihi students. However, even after the equivalency transformation, non-Tawjihi graduates are not allowed to compete with Tawjihi graduates for public university places. For non-Tawjihi graduates, there is a set quota of 5% of places. Most graduates of foreign programs end up paying international fees to get a place in their desired faculty. \n\nRegarding the system used to transform exam results of foreign education programs into the Tawjihi scale, which is a percentage out of 100, some see the system is fair and in fact over lenient with non-Tawjihi graduates, while others see it as unfair.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7723558", "text": "Planum Boreum\n\nPlanum Boreum (Latin: \"the northern plain\") is the northern polar plain on Mars. It extends northward from roughly 80°N and is centered at . Surrounding the high polar plain is a flat and featureless lowland plain called Vastitas Borealis which extends for approximately 1500 kilometres southwards, dominating the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe main feature of the Planum Boreum is a large fissure or canyon in the polar ice cap called Chasma Boreale. It is up to wide and features scarps up to high. By comparison, the Grand Canyon is approximately deep in some places and long but only up to wide. Chasma Boreale cuts through polar deposits and ice, such as those present at Greenland.\n\nPlanum Boreum interfaces with Vastitas Borealis west of Chasma Boreale at an irregular scarp named Rupes Tenuis. This scarp reaches heights of up to 1 km. At other places, the interface is a collection of mesas and troughs.\n\nPlanum Boreum is surrounded by large fields of sand dunes spanning from 75°N to 85°N. These dune fields are named Olympia Undae, Abalos Undae, Siton Undae, and Hyperboreae Undae. Olympia Undae, by far the largest, covers from 100°E to 240°E. Abalos Undae covers from 261°E to 280°E and Hyperboreale Undae spans from 311°E to 341°E. See also List of extraterrestrial dune fields.\n\nPlanum Boreum is home to a permanent ice cap consisting mainly of water ice (with a 1 m thick veneer of carbon dioxide ice during the winter). It has a volume of 1.2 million cubic kilometres and covers an area equivalent to about 1.5 times the size of Texas. It has a radius of 600 km. The maximum depth of the cap is 3 km.\n\nThe spiral troughs in the ice cap are formed by katabatic winds that entrain surface ice eroded from the equator-facing sides of the troughs, likely aided by solar ablation (sublimation), which is then redeposited on the colder pole-facing slopes. The troughs are roughly perpendicular to the wind direction, which is shifted by the Coriolis effect, leading to the spiral pattern. The troughs gradually migrate towards the pole over time; the central troughs have moved about 65 km in the last 2 million years. Chasma Boreale is a canyon-like feature older than the troughs, and in contrast is aligned parallel to the wind direction.\n\nThe surface composition of the northern ice cap in middle spring (after a winter's accumulation of seasonal dry ice) has been studied from orbit. The outer edges of the ice cap are contaminated with dust (0.15% by weight) and are mostly water ice. As one moves toward the pole, the surface water ice content decreases and is replaced by dry ice. The purity of the ice also increases. At the pole, the surface seasonal ice consists of essentially pure dry ice with little dust content and 30 parts per million of water ice.\n\nThe Phoenix lander, launched in 2007, arrived at Mars in May 2008 and successfully landed in the Vastitas Borealis region of the planet on May 25, 2008. The north polar cap of Mars has been proposed as a landing site for a human Mars expedition by Geoffrey A. Landis and by Charles Cockell.\n\nA February 2008 HiRISE observation captured four avalanches in progress off a cliff. The cloud of fine material is across and extends from the base of the cliff. The reddish layers are known to be rock rich in water ice while the white layers are seasonal carbon dioxide frost. The landslide is thought to have originated from the uppermost red layer. Follow-up observations are planned to characterize the nature of the landslide debris.\n\nA large doughnut-shaped cloud appears in North polar region of Mars around the same time every Martian year and of about the same size. It forms in the morning, dissipates by the Martian afternoon. The outer diameter of the cloud is roughly , and the inner hole or eye is across. The cloud is thought to be composed of water-ice, so it is white in color, unlike the more common dust storms.\n\nIt looks like a cyclonic storm, similar to hurricane, but it does not rotate. The cloud appears during the northern summer and at high latitude. Speculation is that this is due to unique climate conditions near the northern pole. Cyclone-like storms were first detected during the Viking orbital mapping program, but the northern annular cloud is nearly three times larger. The cloud has also been detected by various probes and telescopes including the Hubble and Mars Global Surveyor.\n\nWhen Hubble Space Telescope viewed it in 1999, it was thought to be cyclonic storm. The diameter was measured to be approximately 1750 km, and featured an \"eye\" 320 km in diameter.\n\n\n", "id": "7723558", "categories": ["Plains on Mars"], "title": "Planum Boreum"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7723568", "text": "Republic of Lower Canada\n\nThe Republic of Lower Canada was a break-away state proclaimed in the aftermath of the 1837 Rebellions. The defeat of the rebellion meant that the state could never be properly established.\n\nA British colony since 1760, Canada was divided in two distinct entities in 1791: Lower Canada, mainly inhabited by the descendants of the colonists of New France, and Upper Canada, mainly inhabited by British colonists and American Loyalists who established themselves as refugees of the American Revolution. Each entity had its own elected assembly.\n\nThe Francophones, who were the majority in Lower Canada, wished to take into their own hands important decisions regarding the administration of the colony. However, a massive frustration emerged because the assembly was soon restricted to an aesthetical role; the real legislative and executive power was concentrated in the hands of the Governor-General, chosen by London, who often misunderstood or belittled the interests of the people of Lower Canada, which were at times contradictory to those of the British colonial authorities.\n\nThe unstable political situation, lack of individual ministerial responsibility of the colonial government; as well as the economic crisis and the recent independence of the United States and of Latin American states led the people of Lower Canada, in the autumn of 1837, to the Lower Canada Rebellions. The poorly armed, untrained and outnumbered Patriotes were quickly defeated by the British Army. The survivors sought refuge in the United States.\n\nOn 2 January 1838, Robert Nelson as well as a good number of refugees such as Louis-Joseph Papineau, O'Callaghan, Chartier, Rodier, Malhiot, Côté, Bouthillier, Davignon and Gagnon assembled at Middlebury in Vermont to plan a military invasion of Lower Canada. The Patriotes present voted in favour of the quick establishment of a Provisional Government and launched an attack from the safety of the United States. Some voted against this venture, such as Papineau, who judged it doomed from the start without the help of a military power such as the United States or France. This led to some disagreement between the two rebel leaders.\n\nThe first invasion of Lower Canada was attempted on 28 February 1838. The six to seven hundred rebels, led by the two doctors Coté and Nelson, left Vermont with the goal of crossing the border. They soon arrived at a camp situated approximately 1.5 kilometers from the border and Robert Nelson was given the rank of General of the Army and elected President of the Republic of Lower Canada. Nelson then read the Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada, which was very progressive for the time. Lower Canada was unilaterally declared an independent Republic and its people declared absolved of all allegiance to the British crown. The state laid down enjoyed provisions such as the Separation of Church and State, equal rights for \"all\" citizens, abolition of the feudal seigneurial system, abolition of the death penalty, liberty of the press and most notably the equality of the French and English languages including official bilingualism.\n\nUnfortunately for the rebels, they were quickly beaten back by the British army, and the American government, feeling the British pressure, decided to stay neutral, not permitting such an invasion to be mounted from their territory. Nelson and Coté were arrested at the border and charged for violations of neutrality, then released. They took this as a lesson in organization and secrecy, noting they could never hope to match the British army in open warfare with their small numbers and resources. This led to the creation of a guerrilla organization named the \"Frères chasseurs\" under the guise of a hunting club, with the goal of overthrowing the governments of Upper and Lower Canada and to establish sovereign, democratic republican institutions in their place. Its organization was hierarchical and was led by a \"Great Eagle\" (equivalent to a Major-General. He led \"Eagles\" who each represented a district of the province and led a company. The \"Eagles\" chose two men as \"Beavers\" (equivalent to a Captain) who in turn each had under their orders 5 \"Snowshoes\" (Corporals). Each of the \"Snowshoes\" led 9 men with the title of \"Hunters\". It was financed by supporters in Lower Canada and the United States. Wild rumours began to roam regarding the numerical strength of the rebels. John Colborne spoke of tens of thousands, others believed that each parish of Lower Canada had their recruiting office.\n\nAn insurrection was planned for 3 November 1838. On that day the rebels assembled along the border, at Lacolle, Napierville and Chateaugay. Some impatient groups did not wait for Nelson's orders and began attacking piecemeal. At Beauharnois a group occupied a seiugneurie and another seized a steamship to convert it into a warship. The initial plan was to seize Beauharnois, Chateaugay, la Prairie, S-Jean, Chambly, Boucherville and Sorel. Nelson, commanding 800 men, was to go up the Richelieu valley to capture S-Jean and advance to Montreal. Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec City would be successively attacked, drawing upon increasing amounts of manpower and weapons as the population would join them.\n\nNothing went according to plan. In Montreal, authorities quickly responded and arrested many local leaders. Other Patriotes, seeing that the promised weapons failed to arrive, marched to the Native reservation of Kahnawake to seize the Natives' arsenal. They failed and many were made prisoner to be delivered to the British. An American ship which was to deliver weapons was intercepted by a group of Loyalist volunteers. Other weapons which had been hidden at Rouse's Point in the United States were seized by American authorities. Apprehending that the operation was failing, he led his men onwards to Odelltown. In Lacolle, a rumour said that Nelson had tried to run away during the night only to be caught by his men, the doctor convincing them that he was merely inspecting the troops.\n\nOn 10 November, they attacked Odelltown. The colonial militia was quickly reinforced and the rebels had to pull back. Defeated, they retreated to the United States. Nelson himself had fled before the battle was over.\n\nLater that year, Nelson met many leaders of the Patriot movement in Swanton, Vermont, and began to plan border skirmishes to draw the United States into a conflict with the British Empire. However, the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty destroyed the last hopes of getting American assistance to liberate the French Canadians from British colonialism. Ruined, destitute, and his reputation broken, he refused to return to Lower Canada despite an amnesty and stayed in the United States, forsaking politics until his death in 1873 in Staten Island.\n\nLower Canada experienced during and after the rebellions great hardships and oppression and exploitation that would last until the Quiet Revolution, including a systematic program of assimilation; the mandatory use of English in all public matters and business; as well as an economic recession. The Rebellions lead to many more conflicts most notably the 1845 Rebellion Losses Bill which caused enraged Orangist and Tory Anglophones to Burn the Building of Parliament in Montreal, which lead to the construction of Ottawa. A large number of people were drawn to the promise of a better life in the United States to form the large majority of the French American community, concentrated mostly in the industrial north.\n\nThe 1837 and 1838 Rebellions received increased interest following the rise of the Quebec independence movement and many of their symbols are used today to represent Québécois nationalism. The 1838 attempt at separation is often overshadowed by the much more violent, general insurrection that occurred a year earlier.\n\n\n", "id": "7723568", "categories": ["1838 in Lower Canada", "Lower Canada Rebellion", "Separatism in Canada", "Proposed countries"], "title": "Republic of Lower Canada"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7723586", "text": "Street crime\n\nStreet crime is a loose term for any criminal offense in a public place. The difference between street crime and white-collar crime is that street crime is often violence that occurs in a public area whereas white-collar crime is non-violent crime conducted by governments or private industries in order to gain financial stability. According to London's Metropolitan Police Force, \"Robbery, often called 'mugging', and thefts from victims in the street where their property is snatched and the victim is not assaulted is also considered 'street crime'.\" \n\nOther examples of street crime include pickpocketing, the open illegal drugs trade, prostitution in the form of soliciting outside the law, the creation of graffiti and vandalism of public property, and assaults. As a generic term, street crime may include all of these, as well as offenses against private properties such as the stealing of hub caps.\n\nThe majority of street crimes, as portrayed by various news media, are initiated by criminals seeking quick financial gains. However, they can also be carried out by organized individuals with a common goal of profiteering. On the other hand, not all of these instances are considered by the FBI to be \"organized crimes\" due to the random nature of the crimes themselves. \nThe term \"organized crime\" does not often include organized street crimes.\n\nAn organized crime is often a major business, consisting of many individuals associated for the common goal of criminal profiteering. In contrast, street crimes are normally conducted by hastily and loosely formed groups of individuals with the common goal of gaining illicit money through immediate criminal acts.\n\nIn 2016, the government allocated $31.8 billion on the Justice Department, where that money was utilized to incarnate criminals, police them and enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States. This not only takes a toll on the government's budget but as well as the taxpayers and multiple other organizations where money is being deducted in order to imprison criminals. In order to compensate for the increased budget for the Department of Justice often taxes are increased, and oftentimes individuals spend money to prevent encountering crime. Other factors impact those who are victims of these crimes, where they are spending money on medical care, property damages and oftentimes loss of a steady income for their families. Areas of urban decay, characterized by abandoned buildings and cars, unkempt vacant lots, and broken windows tend to attract the homeless and increasing criminal activity. Instead of helping to improve these areas, which can be done by communities, often time the areas start out with minor offenses but often become major events.\n\n\"A second factor is that increasing public concern about the safety of the streets has generated vigorous demands for more police protection and a growing public recognition of the limited capacity of many police agencies to mount an effective program of crime control and prevention. Crime seems to be getting out of hand, engulfing new neighborhoods and erupting in riotous assault, looting, and arson in the central slum areas of the big cities. A statistical report that did not show more crime under such conditions would seem puzzling indeed to the ordinary citizen. A cyclical pattern has been set in motion where the increasing public readiness to accept an accurate portrayal of the full dimensions of the crime problem meets an increased willingness to supply it. As the iceberg of crime rises to the surface of public visibility the need to bring new and more sophisticated resources to bear on the law enforcement task will become increasingly evident.\" \n\nThe sociological impact of crime cause societies to feel unsafe and demand the government protect its people from criminals thus fueling the mass incarceration policy within the United States. There has been a steady increase in individuals who have been incarcerated, ideally this benefits societies but crime has exponentially increased over the last decade due to fear. Because individuals fear to live in communities where small crimes are prevalent often these areas are overlooked and crime rates increase.\n\nThe motivation for street crimes has been explored by multiple studies, including a study cited by Iowa State University, where 55 street crime culprits were interviewed in order to determine the social links tied to street culture.\n\nAfter interviewing those who participated in approximately 101 occurrences of street crimes, among the principal reasons for these crimes, including assault and robbery, were determined to be for societal status and recognition and thrill and excitement. The cultural viewpoint behind street crimes is built on the foundation that the intention of committing these acts comes from shared societal norms that support and reinforce violence. Street crimes are often amplified by the expansion and creation of gangs that propagate and reinforce these types of street culture behaviors.\n\nOther factors that lead to street crimes are poverty, unemployment, and parental neglect. Crime rates in areas that are characterized by higher rates of unemployment and poverty are estimated to be greater than other well-developed areas. There is a greater probability of unemployed adolescents not only being offenders, but also victims of violence and street crimes. Another underlying cause of street crime stems from parents who deal with more financial or social pressures as they are at a higher risk of practicing poor parental techniques such as insufficient disciplinary actions, neglect, and ineffective supervision. Such parental actions are likely to increase the likelihood of teenage participation in street crimes.\n", "id": "7723586", "categories": ["Crime by type"], "title": "Street crime"}

Directed by Pierre Falardeau, it is about the incarceration at the Pied-du-Courant Prison and the execution by hanging there of Patriote participants of the Lower Canada Rebellion. Those rebels sought to make Lower Canada, now Quebec, a republic independent from the British Empire.\n\nIt features as characters the historical figures François-Marie-Thomas Chevalier de Lorimier, his wife Henriette and Charles Hindelang.\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed 1837–38 rebellion in Lower Canada, 800 rebels are held in the Prison de Montréal. The film opens on February 14, 1839, the day when leader Marie Thomas Chevalier De Lormier (Luc Picard) and his comrade-in-arms (Frédéric Gilles) are told they will be hanged in 24 hours. Director Pierre Falardeau makes no doubt about where his sympathies lie; however, 15 février 1839 is as much about human beings confronting death as it is polemic, and there are tender scenes when De Lormier’s wife (Sylvie Drapeau) visits him one last time. \nPierre Falardeau said that Telefilm Canada approved Michel Brault's 1999 movie \"Quand je serai parti... vous vivrez encore\" as an excuse to initially deny funds for \"15 février 1839\".\n\nIt released in the United States by Lionsgate on January 26, 2001.

On Noah's orders, she moved in near Chandra Suresh and befriended him in order to remove Claire Bennet's name from the list of posthumans. She later attempts to kill Sylar during his imprisonment, but he's able to subjugate her.

She first appears in Episode 2 when her parents are brutally murdered by Sylar when Molly was a young girl. She is then taken into custody by The Company, where its revealed that she has the same medical condition that killed Mohinder's sister Shanti, which prevents her using her powers. Mohinder treats Molly with antibodies from his own blood, realizing this is the cure. Molly shows that she is healed by locating Matt Parkman on a map. Later, she explains how her power works, and when mentioned, she refers to Sylar as \"the boogeyman\". She then locates Sylar, giving his location as Isaac's loft. Later, Matt, who went to find Sylar, calls Mohinder to warn him that Sylar may be on his way, though Molly, using her power, says \"he's already here.\" The two escape the building with the help of Niki, D. L. and Micah. In Kirby Plaza, they all witness the bout between Sylar and Peter Petrelli. As paramedics take the wounded Matt away on a stretcher, Molly runs up and asks him not to die, that says that he is her hero.\n\nMolly returns in Season 2, having been adopted by Parkman and Suresh; as a favor to Matt, she locates his father Maury, despite fearing him as the \"Nightmare Man\" who torments her, she then collapses in shock. Mohinder delivers her to the Company, thinking it would be better for her there. In the Season 2 finale, she is menaced by Sylar, but escapes unharmed; she makes a few brief appearances in Season 3, but eventually disappears from the series without explanation. In the graphic novels, she is shown as having been sent to live with Mohinder's mother in India, hopefully out of harm's way.\n\nIn \"Heroes Reborn\", Molly played by Francesca Eastwood, reappears as a young woman who is being used by Erica Kravid to track \"evos\" after Claire's reveal of their existence. While she is eventually rescued by Noah Bennet, Molly seems to be mentally unstable and refuses to tell Noah anything more than that Claire is dead and that she was part of a group that was doing anything to protect \"them\", later implied to be Claire's children Nathan (a.k.a. Tommy Clark) and Malina. She then committed suicide to shut down an evo tracking system. In the episode \"June 13 — Part 1\", she is encountered by Mohinder at the Odessa Peace Summit and he gives her a copy of his research on a coming disaster in case something happens to him.

L., came to New York for Micah. She is seen hinting at her true obese self in the episode \"Landslide\". In \"Kindred\" Candice had assumed the form of a beautiful red-head under the alias of Michelle and is revealed to be tending a wounded and powerless Sylar, who she maintains constantly trapped under her illusions. She reveals to him that she works for the Company and it was she who pulled him off of Kirby Plaza. She is soon afterwards nevertheless attacked and murdered by a frustrated Sylar, who attempts to absorb her illusion's power, but it does not work. After her death, her form reverts to its original self of the overweight woman.\n\nCandice Wilmer's origins are later revealed in the \"Betty\" graphic novel where its shown that Candice's true name is actually Betty, a rather plain looking person in high school, usually dressing in black and hanging out with her friend Ren Metzger. They were bullied by classmates, including cheerleaders and football players. As she endured these emotions, Betty discovered she had the power to create horrific illusions.

In 1977, she met Shanti Suresh and began to do research on the Shanti virus. On Company orders, she experimented on the virus, and weaponized it, creating Strain 138, which is capable of killing 93% of the world's population, including both humans and posthumans. When Monroe attempted to steal the strain, Pratt insisted that the program on the virus be stopped, and the strain destroyed. Kaito Nakamura and the other founders did not agree and locked the virus away at Primatech Paper in Odessa, Texas. Pratt was not happy about the decision. She is killed by Monroe in her house .\n\nWest Rosen, portrayed by Nicholas D'Agosto, has the ability to fly. He was abducted by Mr. Bennet and the Haitian for examination prior to the start of the series, though he tried to escape. He saw Mr. Bennet before being recaptured and having his memory wiped, though he still remembers Bennet's glasses. Years later, he and Claire become classmates at Costa Verde High School. They date in season 2 with West eventually learning the truth about his kidnapping. He and Noah Bennet later team up to save Claire, but West breaks up with her when she wants to reveal her powers. In \"Let It Bleed\" she tells Peter that she and West are now Facebook friends and she calls him so Peter can copy his power as a way of remembering Nathan.\n\nBridget Bailey, portrayed by Tehmina Sunny, has the ability of psychometry, introduced by the BBC in its mirror of Heroes 360 information.

He is able to melt a figurine, boil liquid from a distance without damaging the mug, and burn a person to death from the inside out.\n\nEric Doyle, portrayed by David H. Lawrence XVII, has the ability of \"puppet mastery\", which allows him to control the actions of others by manipulating them like a puppeteer. In the webseries \"Nowhere Man\" he displays control over inanimate objects by closing a door without touching it. He is initially captured by the Company after causing people to seemingly commit suicide with his ability. He later escapes during the confrontation between Elle and Sylar, and returns to running \"Doyle's Marionette Theater\". He has obsessive romantic feelings for Meredith Gordon, which are renewed after she goes to him fearing that Claire is going to attempt to capture him. Doyle is eventually recaptured after forcing Meredith, Claire and Sandra Bennet to play a variation of Russian roulette, not knowing about Claire's ability. In \"Dual\", he is freed by Noah Bennet along with two others and offered freedom for killing Sylar. He attempts to save Meredith, but Sylar breaks free of his control and incapacitates him. During \"Redemption\" he goes back to his old ways and forces Emma Coolidge to use her powers to draw thousands of innocent people to the Carnival to be murdered by Samuel. Following a prophetic dream by Peter, Sylar confronts Eric to save Emma, but falls under his control. However, Eric makes the mistake of partially releasing his control over Emma to taunt her about her deafness and she hits him with a sonic blast, breaking his control over Sylar. Sylar pins Eric, but ties him up in lights rather than kill him as he has now turned to the side of good with Peter's help.\n\nThe German, portrayed by Ken Lally, has the ability of magnetism manipulation, allowing him to control ferrous objects and materials.

In \"One of Us, One of Them\", he is killed by Knox after disagreeing with his plan.\n\nFlint Gordon Jr., portrayed by Blake Shields, is Meredith Gordon's younger brother, who also possesses the power of pyrokinesis. He produces extremely hot blue flames as opposed to Meredith's orange flames. He is slow-witted, causing him to be more of a lackey than a leader, especially when around Meredith. He and Meredith were separated as children after Meredith accidentally used her ability to burn down their abusive father's house.\n\nSamson Gray, portrayed by John Glover, is the biological father of Sylar (Gabriel Gray). Like his son, he possesses the ability of intuitive aptitude, allowing him to steal the abilities of other super-powered humans. He is responsible for the death of Gabriel's mother back in 1980. Appearing in \"Shades of Gray', he is old and dying of terminal cancer, hiding from Nathan's agents in an old trailer in the woods of Newark, New Jersey.\n\nBenjamin \"Knox\" Washington, portrayed by Jamie Hector, gains enhanced strength when others around him are frightened. He often uses the threat of becoming stronger to fuel the fears of others. His past was going to be featured in a dropped storyline in \"Villains\" where he attempts to get out of gang life with the help of Matt Parkman, returning to his old ways after his power manifests; it was later released as the webseries \"Hard Knox\". He is initially a Level 5 prisoner who escapes after the conflict between Sylar and Elle. He joins with the others to hunt down Noah Bennet, though he eventually ends up working for Arthur Petrelli.

She can move herself at speeds fast enough to just barely outrun a nuclear explosion, move fast enough to be at normal speed when Hiro Nakamura slows down time to the point where time appears to have stopped, and can extend her ability to those she is in contact with. She suffers from cerebral palsy and relied on crutches and braces to walk before gaining her powers. She first becomes acquainted with Hiro Nakamura, who refers to her as \"nemesis\", after she steals his half of a chemical formula that gives ordinary people super powers. She works for the Pinehearst Company under the direction of Maury Parkman (who appears to her as Mr. Linderman), charged with recruiting members. Daphne eventually switches sides and helps rescue Hiro from the past. Afterwards, she and Hiro steal and destroy the Formula and she tries to make a life with Matt Parkman. During \"Trust and Blood\", Daphne is shot and apparently killed. She is revealed to be alive, though seriously wounded during \"Cold Wars.\" She is rescued in \"Cold Snap\" and taken to the hospital where she is treated for her gunshot wound and an infection. She apparently recovers and takes off to Paris, but quickly realizes it's a dream where Matt is giving her a happy ending. Knowing she will die, she asks Matt to fly her to the Moon. He does so in the dream as she dies of her injuries in the real world.\n\nJesse Murphy, portrayed by Francis Capra, is a former prisoner of Level 5 with the ability to produce powerful sonic waves with his voice. According to executive producer Greg Beeman, Jesse's power was originally \"Earthquake-stomp\", but was changed due to budget constraints. He is described by Knox as having no friends. He and Knox were captured by Noah Bennet and the Haitian after the two used their powers in an attempt to take over a neighborhood.\n\nIshi Nakamura, portrayed by Tamlyn Tomita, was the wife of Kaito Nakamura and mother to Kimiko and Hiro. She was shown as deceased when Hiro was eight years old when he went back in time with his father in an attempt to convince him to escape his death. It was revealed that she had an ability in an interview with Aron Coleite and Joe Pokaski, which is shown to be the ability to heal living organisms through kisses in \"Our Father\". She revives Hiro's sick bird and restores the future Hiro's lost memories.\n\nMatthew \"Matty\" Parkman, Jr. is the infant son of Matt Parkman and his ex-wife Janice Parkman, and the grandson of Maury Parkman. He has the ability to activate and deactivate objects, whether they are electronic, mechanical, or even human, earning him the nickname \"Toddler Touch-And-Go\" from Hiro. He is first mentioned in the episode \"Five Years Gone\", his father working to capture other posthumans in exchange for the protection of him. Matt Parkman, Jr. later appears in the main timeline, living in California with his mother. Matt Senior divorces his wife because they initially believe Matt Junior is the son of the man she cheated on him with, but it turns out they were wrong. He restores Hiro Nakamura's powers when they meet and the truth of his parentage brings his parents back together.\n\nArthur Petrelli, portrayed by Robert Forster, is the husband of Angela Petrelli, the father of Nathan Petrelli and Peter Petrelli, and the biological grandfather of Claire Bennet. Angela has stated that she and Arthur have gone through \"great lengths\" to protect Claire. He has the power to take the abilities of other posthumans through physical contact. Once he takes an ability, he cannot return it. The powers he has taken are telepathy from an unknown source, though hinted at being Charles Deveaux; the regenerative abilities of Adam Monroe (which killed Adam, as he immediately aged 400+ years and crumbled into dust); Peter's empathic mimicry and the powers he'd absorbed as a result (including the Haitian's mental manipulation); Maya Herrera's poison emission; and Hiro Nakamura's time manipulation. Arthur's range of powers is such that he can overcome the Haitian's dampening powers after a short period, though not without significant effort. Hiro eventually learns through a \"spirit walk\" that Arthur was actually the one who'd ordered Nathan's accident, not Linderman, and that Arthur had repeatedly manipulated Angela's mind throughout their marriage, to get her to do what he wanted. After Linderman revealed the truth to her, Angela tried to kill Arthur by poisoning him, but he was saved by Nathan arriving home and calling 911. Arthur survived the poisoning attempt, but was completely paralyzed and could only communicate through telepathy, so he faked his own death. After stealing Adam Monroe's regenerative powers, Arthur was able to heal the damage the poison had done to his body, recovering completely. In \"Our Father\", Peter and the Haitian confront Arthur with the intention of killing him. Arthur offers to use the Formula to restore Peter's powers if his son comes with him, but Peter refuses. As the Haitian loses his grip on Arthur's powers, Peter fires a gun at Arthur who is only saved by the timely intervention of Sylar. However, Sylar only saved him to discover if Arthur is actually his father or not. Using his new lie detection abilities, Sylar is able to tell that Arthur in fact lied to him. Telling Peter \"you're not a killer, Peter...but I am\", Sylar telekinetically shoves Peter's bullet through Arthur's head, destroying the spot that controls regeneration and killing Arthur. The Formula's catalyst dies with him.\n\nDaniel Pine, portrayed by Franc Ross, is a Vietnam veteran with the ability to transform parts of his body into metal.

He is then recaptured by Meredith and Noah Bennet.\n\nBaron Samedi, portrayed by Demetrius Grosse, is a powerful warlord in the jungles of Haiti, and is the half-brother of the Haitian. He possesses impenetrable skin, which grants him a degree of invulnerability from trauma such as fire, knives, and bullets. He shares a name with a loa.\n\nScott, portrayed by Chad Faust, is a Marine recruited by the Pinehearst Company. Wanting to be more than human so that he can make up for his fellow Marines that died, he is the first person to try the newly perfected formula, which grants him the ability of enhanced strength. However, as he is about to stop Flint Gordon and Peter Petrelli from destroying the lab and the formula in \"Dual\", his neck is snapped by Knox.\n\nAlice Shaw, played by Laura Marano in flashbacks and by Diana Scarwid in the present, is the estranged younger sister of Angela Petrelli, the aunt of Nathan Petrelli and Peter Petrelli, and the great-aunt of Claire Bennet. She has the ability of weather manipulation. Her powers are seemingly linked to her emotions as she is able to summon gale force winds when frightened, or generate lightning bolts or hailstones when angered. She first appears in the flashback in episode \"1961\".\n\nUsutu, portrayed by Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine, makes himself known to Matt after he is teleported to Africa by the future Peter Petrelli. He had painted an image of the earth exploding on a nearby rock. This image appears several times in the episodes \"The Second Coming\" and \"The Butterfly Effect\", painted on various objects in various places. He also seems to have an extensive knowledge of Matt's life, having painted the major events of Matt's story arc in Volume One when he was just a child. Like the precognition demonstrated by Isaac Mendez (which is also why Hiro refers to him as \"Mr. African Isaac\"), this skill can be activated at will, though Usutu prefers to listen to music while he works. In a discussion with Parkman, Usutu reveals that he is aware of various changes in the timeline, specifically events that change his earlier predictions. As Hiro finishes his own spirit journey, Usutu is decapitated by Arthur Petrelli, but appears in Suresh's Loft with Ando, Hiro, Matt, and Daphne in \"Dual\".\n\nAlex Woolsley, portrayed by Justin Baldoni, is an employee at Sam's Comic Book Shop with the ability to breathe underwater. He first discovered his ability while on his high school's swim team. He is rescued by Claire Bennet on orders of the mysterious Rebel, and secretly took up residence within the Bennet household. Eventually Claire's mother finds out about his hiding in their house and she helps him change his identity to protect him. During his stay at the Bennet household, Claire and he develop a mutual romantic interest, culminating in a kiss while they hide from government agents underwater in a pool (thus also allowing Alex to transfer air to her thanks to his ability, removing the need for them to surface to breathe). In the graphic novel \"The Scenic Route\", he is rescued again, this time by Noah Bennet and Claire's ex-boyfriend West Rosen, and both boys are advised to lie low.\n\nArnold, portrayed by Jack Wallace, has the ability of space-time manipulation. Introduced in \"Orientation\", he is shown as a member of the \"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\", and as any member, is considered family. He is asked by Samuel Sullivan to send him 14 years back in time so he can meet the adult Hiro Nakamura, which he is capable of doing despite his bad health. He is shown as an old and dying man, and it is implied that Samuel intends to replace him with Hiro. In \"Once Upon a Time in Texas\", Arnold once again sends Samuel back in time to find Hiro; after Hiro saves Charlie from Sylar and her aneurysm, Samuel orders Arnold to take her to the carnival in present and then to hide her somewhere in time away from Hiro so he will stay with them. This final effort killed Arnold. In the graphic Novel \"Smoke and Mirrors\", an altar is seen in honor of Arnold as the carnies discuss about Samuel forcing Arnold to use his ability without any concern about his health. Hiro eventually reunites with an old Charlie who tells him that Arnold took her to Milwaukee on January 26, 1944. Though Hiro offers to go back and retrieve her after Arnold leaves, Charlie refuses as she had a life there and Hiro respects her wishes.\n\nThe Bowman Family consists of Chris Bowman, portrayed by Daryl Crittenden, with his wife Gail and daughter Jenny, who are workers at the \"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\" as part of the fire-breathing family. The three of them exhibit the ability to breathe fire; Chris and Gail exhibit orange flames, but little Jenny exhibits blue ones (\"in main series she exhibits orange flames as well\"). Although seen in background as member of the \"family\" since \"Orientation\", they are shown mainly in iStories (Faction Zero and Slow Burn). In \"Strange Attractors\" (\"Slow Burn iStory chapter 5\") they are told by Samuel Sullivan to show their ability to Tracy so she will feel comfortable at the carnival, but she felt the other way around so they stop. In the graphic novel \"Smoke and Mirrors\", Amanda watches as the Bowman family practices their fire-breathing act making her want to be a Bowman herself.\n\nEmma Coolidge, portrayed by Deanne Bray, is a deaf woman working in the same hospital as Peter. Dialogue indicates that she is trained as a physician, but prefers to work archiving patients' data instead of treating them. In the episode \"Ink\", she discovers that she can perceive sound as a form of colored light; the louder the sound, the more intense and colorful the light. Her doctor (also her mother) suggests that this is a form of synesthesia (mixed signals from the different senses). At the park, she sees the music a cello player produces, and then starts playing it herself, producing beautiful music. She constantly uses headphones in public to avoid being asked anything, so people will not notice that she is deaf. In the episode \"Hysterical Blindness\", Emma discovers that she is able to convert sound into physical force after damaging her apartment walls while playing a cello once more; the cello was in a box with the \"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\" label on it. In \"Tabula Rasa\", she is afraid of her power and seeks Peter to help her ultimately Hiro helps her understand that her ability is a gift, and once she knows what she can do, she can use it to do good things. As Peter and Emma learn that Hiro is dying, Emma makes him promise he will stay in bed, although he constantly tells Emma he feels alive when he uses his ability and he will die with dignity like Charlie intended to do.\n\nDamien, portrayed by Harry Perry, is a carnival worker at \"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\", introduced in \"Tabula Rasa\", with the ability to restore, heal and distort other people's memories. By orders of Samuel, he takes Sylar to the center chamber of the \"Hall of Mirrors\" and touches his head using his ability on him. Then, he leaves Sylar alone while he sees his real memories reflecting in every mirror. In \"Thanksgiving\", he is present during Thanksgiving dinner; after Edgar's escape, he surprises Hiro while talking to Samuel, disrupting his memories, but apparently in a way he did not expect (\"which is also seen in the graphic novel \"The Trip, Part 1\"\"). In \"The Art of Deception\", he helps Samuel to walk over the dying Lydia.\n\nEdgar, portrayed by Ray Park, has the ability of enhanced speed and works at the \"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\". Introduced in \"Orientation\", he is sent by Samuel Sullivan to kill Emile Danko in order to retrieve a mysterious compass. At first he refuses, stating that he does not kill unless absolutely necessary. Samuel chokes him (with a tattoo hand controlled by his power), but releases him with a promise to not force Edgar again after he does this task. Edgar fails once, as Danko does not have the artifact with him and Tracy manages to freeze his knife and arm; he fails again when Peter Petrelli mimics his ability. He goes after Noah Bennet and finally takes the compass to Samuel, leaving Noah badly wounded. After Lydia learns the truth of Joseph's murder with the help of Hiro Nakamura, Edgar tries to expose Samuel who frames him as the murderer. Samuel tries to kill Edgar, but Hiro saves him and convinces Edgar to flee rather than kill Samuel to help stop him later. He's eventually captured by Noah who Lauren Gilmore gets to talk to Edgar rather than torture him. Edgar initially agrees to work with Noah to stop Samuel, but after Noah shows little care for the other carnies, Edgar takes the information he gave Noah and takes off. Edgar returns after Lydia's murder and rejoins the Carnival, but while he's seemingly accepted back, he remains aware of what Samuel is capable of and is disturbed by what Samuel is planning. In \"Brave New World\", he kidnaps Noah Bennet in Central Park and tells him he wants to stop Samuel, but can't just kill him in front of everyone. Edgar figures Noah has a plan and he aids Noah, Claire and Eli in exposing Samuel's actions to the carnies. Afterwards, Edgar helps the carnies leave and is teleported away by Hiro to safety, rendering Samuel effectively powerless.\n\nEli, portrayed by Todd Stashwick, is a thief and diamond-mine owner who is found by Tracy Strauss (\"following orders from Samuel Sullivan\") in a cruise in the southwestern coast of Africa in the graphic novel \"Prodigals, Part 1: Immersed\". Tracy interrupts his way into a girl and accidentally reveals the money he has stolen from a tourist, and then Eli takes out a gun. When Tracy recognizes Eli, he gets angry and distrustful to hear she knows his real name, and creates many clones to surround Tracy. Unknowing what she meant about the carnival, \"they\" shoot Tracy, also unaware that her abilities will allow her to survive and fight back. The original Eli is already in a boat escaping, and Tracy knows she must follow him to the open sea. In \"Prodigals, Part 2: Witch Hunt\", Tracy is tracking down the root Eli at Cape Town and in the process ends up killing many of his clones. After understanding how Eli and clones move around, Eli surprises her at his diamond mine where his clones work. Instead of killing her when having a chance, he decides to receive her and show her the place. In \"Prodigals, Part 3: Parched\", Tracy is seen fighting against a horde of clones while the root Eli stands quietly. After learning Samuel is the actual leader of the carnival, he agrees to return, as it was Joseph who exiled him but always was loyal to Samuel. Upon his return to the Carnival, he acts as Samuel's right-hand man with the power of cloning, but displays the weakness that if the original is knocked out or killed, the clones will all disappear. His clones lack a mind of their own as well, making Matt Parkman's telepathy useless on them. In \"The Art of Deception\" he murders Lydia to enable Samuel's plans. In \"The Wall\" and \"Brave New World\" Eli is sent to kill Matt Parkman, Peter Petrelli and Sylar to stop their interfering in Samuel's plans. Dialogue between Eli and Matt indicates that while Eli will go along with Samuel's terrible plans, he knows its wrong. The Eli clones nearly kill Matt, but Peter and Sylar are able to overpower the clones sent after them and knock out the real Eli, saving Matt. Peter then reads Eli's mind to learn Samuel's plans and he and Sylar take off to stop them, leaving Eli with Matt who proceeds to use his powers to brainwash Eli against Samuel. Eli then returns to the Carnival and aids Edgar, Noah and Claire Bennet in exposing Samuel for what he really is, admitting to his murder of Lydia along the way. Eli's support of Claire's claims breaks the carnies faith in Samuel and causes them to leave him.\n\nIan Michaels, portrayed by Adam Lazarre-White, is a homeless man introduced in \"Upon This Rock\" who has the ability to control, manipulate, and accelerate plant growth. Originally, he was terrified by his ability and opted to hide in seclusion in Central Park. He was soon found by Samuel Sullivan and Emma Coolidge and shown the benefits of having an ability. He is now part of the \"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\".\n\nJeremy Greer, portrayed by Mark L. Young, is an evolved human introduced in \"Tabula Rasa\", a teenager with the ability to control the life force of living creatures, so he can either heal them or kill them.\n\nLydia, \"The Painted Lady\", is portrayed by Dawn Olivieri. Her ability is backfiring, making her susceptible to anyone else's desires, such as running away when her boyfriend wanted her to, and Carol's desire for Amanda to be hers, which led Lydia to abandon her baby with Carol. Lydia serves as the main antagonist, but not villain, of the Webseries: Slow Burn. While reluctantly trying to manipulate Sylar, he copies her powers harmlessly. Growing more and more suspicious of Samuel's activities, Lydia offers to help Hiro Nakamura find his lost love Charlie through her powers though she is unsuccessful. After learning of Samuel having Hiro return before he killed Mohinder Suresh but not to save Joseph Sullivan, Lydia asks Hiro to take her back in time eight weeks so she can see what really happened to Joseph. Though Hiro is reluctant, he eventually takes them back though he indicates Lydia may have triggered this with her own powers. The two witness Samuel confront Joseph about the full extent of his powers and then murder him in a rage. Lydia's gasp of shock draws Samuel's attention, but she is able to help Hiro transport them back to their own time. There, she reveals the truth to Edgar, resulting in Samuel pinning the murder on him and trying to kill Edgar. Hiro saves Edgar to Lydia's relief and she agrees to keep the truth secret to protect Amanda. Samuel later has Eli murder her to pin the crime on Noah Bennet and drive the Carnival into a frenzy after his destruction of a nearby town causes them to start to falter. Under Matt Parkman's brainwashing, Eli later admits to her murder and this, along with Edgar revealing what Lydia told him about Joseph's murder causes the carnies to abandon Samuel, allowing Peter Petrelli to defeat him.\n\nJoseph Sullivan, portrayed by Andrew Connolly, was the leader of the \"Sullivan Bros. Carnival\", until his mysterious death. Seeing his burial in \"Orientation\" and being mentioned so many times, mainly by his brother Samuel, Lydia and Edgar, he is referred to as a kind and fair leader, with visions of family and peace far from Samuel's. As his rightful successor, Samuel tries to fill his void by adding new members to the family, although Lydia and Edgar say it was not Joseph's will (\"Acceptance\"). In the episode \"Ink\", Samuel reveals he and Joseph once lived and served at a mansion while kids. In the episode \"Hysterical Blindness\", Samuel chooses Sylar from a list of evolved humans as the one who will fill the void left by Joseph's death, although is unknown what ability Joseph held. In \"Shadowboxing\", Samuel states Danko is the one who killed Joseph and that's why he kept a compass hidden, Joseph's. In \"Brother's Keeper\" Joseph meets with Mohinder Suresh about his interest in Samuel eight weeks before the present of the episode. He asks Mohinder to forget the whole thing and to burn the film he has of Samuel's powers. However, unbeknownst to him, Samuel overhears part of the discussion and grows interested. In \"Thanksgiving\", a suspicious Lydia has Hiro Nakamura take her back in time eight weeks to witness Joseph's murder and discover the truth. The two witness Samuel and Joseph go into a field where Joseph reveals that Samuel's powers grow exponentially when surrounded by evos which is why he has limited the number of people in the Carnival. Knowing that Samuel is out of control, Joseph sent the compass to Danko so he could find them and arrest Samuel. Demanding to know more, Samuel propels a rock through Joseph's throat in a moment of rage, mortally wounding him. Joseph dies in his repentant brother's arms while Lydia's gasp nearly reveals herself and Hiro. Hiro manages to return them to the present in time to avoid the past Samuel, but the present day Samuel realizes what happened and pins the murder on Edgar who escapes with Hiro's help. During \"Brave New World\", Claire reveals the murder of Joseph to the carnies while trying to turn them against Samuel as an example of how out of control he's gotten. While Samuel denies the claim, Edgar backs Claire up and combined with Eli's confession to murdering Lydia on Samuel's orders, Joseph's murder causes the carnies to leave Samuel.\n\nRebecca \"Becky\" Taylor, portrayed by Tessa Thompson, possesses the power of invisibility. She is first introduced in \"Hysterical Blindness\" as a pledge master for a sorority on Claire Bennet's college campus. She is connected to the Sullivan Bros. Carnival by way of her \"Uncle Samuel\". It is revealed that she is the one responsible for the death of Claire's first roommate, Annie, and for fueling Claire's suspicion of Gretchen. When Claire and Gretchen are exploring the slaughterhouse as part of the hazing process, an invisible Becky attempts to kill Gretchen twice, but is thwarted by Claire at both turns. Becky exhibits her power in front of all four girls being hazed and is forced to flee after Claire hits her. It's revealed in \"Shadowboxing\" that Becky has an unpleasant past with Noah Bennet as he killed her father during a bag and tag mission for the Company; her fear towards Noah activating her invisibility.\n\nBianca Karina is an agent of the Company who can adapt her lungs to enable her to breathe in any environment, including underwater.

In \"The Butterfly Effect\" and \"Dreams Until Death\", she and Gael confront Sylar outside the Bennet house after he leaves having taken Claire Bennet's ability, and she is killed by Sylar after she and Gael attempt to capture him. However, Gael identifies himself as \"special\", so Bianca gets a quick death and her power is not taken.\n\nCaleb, portrayed by Dusty Sorg, is a worker at the \"Sullivan Bros.

It was nominally an independent company sponsored by the Denaby and Cadeby Colliery Company but was worked by the Hull and Barnsley Railway.\n\nThe S.Y.J.R. received its Act of Parliament on 14 August 1890, and opened for goods traffic on 1 September 1894 and for passengers on 1 December the same year. The passenger service lasted less than 9 years, the last trains running on 1 February 1903. Intermediate passenger stations were at Sprotborough and Pickburn and Brodsworth.\n\nThe Hull and Barnsley Railway was absorbed into the North Eastern Railway in 1922 and then to the London and North Eastern Railway at the Grouping.\n\nThe line was over 11 miles in length, with many embankments and cuttings, it also had steep uphill grades in the northerly direction at parts, including a 1 in 100 rise after Denaby, and another steep rise near Wrangbrook, 3miles long being between built at a grade of 1 in 100 or 1 in 112. It crossed the Great Northern and Great Central Joint line 2.5 miles after Wrangbrook junction, a short tunnel \"Cadeby Tunnel\" was required around 1.5 miles from the Denaby end, being about 250-yards long. A branch to Brodsworth colliery was added in 1908 from Pickburn.\n\nGoods traffic lasted longer than passenger traffic. Most of the line, including the branch which served Brodsworth Colliery, was closed on 7 August 1967.\n\nA short stub remained after this date, extending northwards from Lowfield Junction, the line's southern connection with the Great Central Railway's Doncaster-Sheffield line just west of Conisbrough station. This section ran to sidings serving a limestone quarry operated by the Steetley Dolomite company. It saw its last main line traffic in July 1975, although it continued to be used as a link by the National Coal Board to transfer traffic between Cadeby Colliery and Denaby Main Colliery, where the N.C.B. had wagon repair facilities, until the collieries closed in 1986.\n\n", "id": "7723687", "categories": ["Hull and Barnsley Railway", "Rail transport in South Yorkshire"], "title": "South Yorkshire Junction Railway"}

There have been three summits held to date, with the most recent having occurred from September 3–4, 2018 in Beijing, China. The first summit was held November 2006, also in Beijing.\n\nThe first Ministerial Conference was held in Beijing from 10 to 12 October 2000. President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji of the State Council and Vice President Hu Jintao of the People's Republic of China participated in the conference. More than 80 ministers from China and 44 countries and representatives from 17 international and regional organizations attended this meeting. African attendees included President Gnassingbé Eyadéma of Togo, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, President Benjamin William Mkapa of Tanzania, and Secretary-General Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the Organization of African Unity. The conference passed the \"Beijing Declaration of the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation\" and the \"Programme for China–Africa Cooperation in Economic and Social Development\".\n\nThe second Ministerial Conference was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 15 to 16 December 2003. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, six African presidents, three vice presidents, two other prime ministers, and one president of the senate as well as President Alpha Oumar Konare of the Commission of African Union and the representative of the UN Secretary General attended the opening ceremony and delivered speeches. More than 70 ministers from China and 44 African countries attended the conference. The Conference passed the \"Addis Ababa Action Plan\" (2004–2006).\n\nThe first FOCAC Summit and the third Ministerial Conference were held in Beijing from November 3 to 5, 2006. Hu Jintao, President of China, and heads of state or heads of government from 35 African countries attended this Summit. President Hu rolled out $5 billion worth of concessionary loans to Africa during the summit. As one of the \"Eight Measures\" for Sino-African relations President Hu announced the creation of the China-Africa Development Fund to further Chinese investment in Africa with US$1 billion of initial funding with its fund expected to grow to US$5 billion in the future.\n\nThe fourth Ministerial Conference of the FOCAC was held at Soho-Square, in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on 8 to 9 November 2009. The meeting reviewed how the consensus of the Beijing Summit has been implemented. It also adopted a Sharm el-Sheikh declaration and an action plan for 2010–2012 to chart the path for further China–Africa cooperation. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and African heads of state or government from 49 countries attended the opening ceremony. Also addressing the opening session were the presidents of Liberia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Sudan, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Central African Republic, and Tanzania; the prime ministers of Ethiopia, Côte d'Ivoire, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the vice presidents of Seychelles, Ghana, and Burundi; the President of the National Assembly of Gabon; and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and Commerce Minister Chen Deming led a delegation to attend the meeting.\n\nA $10 billion low cost loan was announced on November 9, 2009, double the $5 billion loan announced and implemented at the 2006 Beijing Summit. A 1 billion U.S. dollar special loan for small and medium-sized African businesses was also established. China also announced eight new policy measures aimed at strengthening relations with Africa were \"more focused on improving people's livelihoods\". Wen announced that China will write off the debt of some of the poorest African nations. He said China will construct 100 new clean-energy projects on the continent covering solar power, bio-gas and small hydro-power and gradually lower customs duties on 95 percent of products from African states with which it has diplomatic ties. He also stated that China would undertake 100 joint demonstration projects on scientific and technological research, receive 100 African postdoctoral fellows to conduct scientific research in China and assist them in going back and serving their home countries. The number of agricultural technology demonstration centers built by China in Africa will be increased to 20, 50 agricultural technology teams would be sent to Africa and 2,000 agricultural technology personnel would be trained for Africa, in order to help strengthen Africa's ability to ensure food security.\n\nChina also will provide medical equipment and antimalarial materials worth 500 million yuan to the 30 hospitals and 30 malaria prevention and treatment centers built by China and train 3,000 doctors and nurses for Africa. Wen further stated that China will build 50 China–Africa friendship schools and train 1,500 school principals and teachers for African countries and increase the number of Chinese government scholarships to Africa to 5,500 by 2012. China will also train a total of 20,000 professionals of various fields for Africa over the next three years.\n\nThe head of the United Nations food agency, World Food Programme, Executive Director Josette Sheeran praised the forum's role in food security, agriculture and infrastructure in Africa.\n\nThe fifth Ministerial Conference of the FOCAC was held on 19 to 20 July 2012 in Beijing, China.\n\nThe second FOCAC Summit and sixth Ministerial Conference has been held on 4 to 5 December 2015 in Johannesburg, South Africa. One of the outcomes of the Johannesburg Forum was the Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages programme.\n\nThe 2018 summit took place in Beijing in early September 2018. By May 2018, all African UN member states recognised the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of China, with the exception of Eswatini (Swaziland), which maintains relations with Taiwan. Before the summit, China declared it does “hope that by the time the China-Africa cooperation forum Beijing summit happens, we can have a happy picture of the whole family”, i.e. it hopes to establish diplomatic relations with Swaziland before the summit begins. The government of Eswatini has rejected these overtures from the People's Republic of China It was also reported that more African leaders went to the 2018 summit, than to the similarly timed UN general assembly meeting.\n\n\nIan Taylor \"The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC)\" London: Routledge, 2012. .\n\n", "id": "7723713", "categories": ["2009 in international relations", "21st-century diplomatic conferences", "Politics of Africa", "Africa–China relations"], "title": "Forum on China–Africa Cooperation"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7723826", "text": "Mortal Error\n\nMortal Error: The Shot That Killed JFK is a 1992 non-fiction book by Bonar Menninger outlining a theory by sharpshooter, gunsmith, and ballistics expert Howard Donahue that a Secret Service agent accidentally fired the shot that actually killed President John F. Kennedy. \"Mortal Error\" was published by St Martin's Press in hardback, paperback, and audiobook.\n\nMenninger is also the author of \"And Hell Followed With It: Life and Death in a Kansas Tornado\", which won a Kansas Notable Book Award in 2011.\n\nDonahue first became interested in the story of the assassination of John F. Kennedy after participating in a re-creation of the shooting as one of eleven invited marksmen and sharpshooters. He demonstrated that it would have been possible for Lee Harvey Oswald to have fired three shots in the time specified by the Warren Commission, and was the only one of the eleven to better the 5.6-second window. However the experience highlighted to Donahue other concerns regarding the Warren report, and in particular the fact that the testimony of ballistics experts seemed to have been completely omitted from the Commission's evidence gathering.\n\nConducting his own investigation, Donahue eventually decided that the bullet that struck Kennedy in the head had in fact been fired by United States Secret Service Special Agent George Warren Hickey Jr. (March 24, 1923 to February 25, 2005) from an AR-15 rifle carried in the car immediately following the President's vehicle. The series of events is as follows: After the first shot which hit the street was fired, Hickey turns completely around and acquires Oswald on the sixth floor of the school book depository building. His turned head is documented in an AP photograph by James Altgens. Hickey reaches for the AR-15 under the seat, releases the safety and begins to lift the gun. The second shot is fired by Oswald, hitting the president and Texas Governor John Connally. The president's car and the follow-up car containing Hickey suddenly speed up. This is attested to by Secret Service agent Clint Hill. Agent Hickey, who is unstable because he is standing on the cushion of the seat, rather than the floor of the car, begins to fall back due to the acceleration of the vehicle, pulling the trigger of the AR-15. The gun is pointed toward Kennedy at that instant, and the bullet strikes him squarely in the back of the head.\n\nIn parallel, he believes Oswald's second shot through Kennedy's neck may have already critically wounded the president before the third shot was fired.\n\nDonahue was encouraged in his investigations by Ralph Reppert, a reporter for the \"Baltimore Sun\". In 1977, Reppert published Donahue's theory in two articles, which appeared on Sunday, May 1, and the following Sunday, with the second article accompanied by an editorial. These two men were keen to collaborate on a book on the subject, but this was cut short by Reppert's ill health and subsequent death. Donahue later also approached author John Davis in the hope that a book would still be written. The original copyright of Mortal Error read \"Copyright 1992 Bonar Menninger and Howard Donahue\" but some later editions did not mention Donahue's copyright. The \"Acknowledgements\" section (dated January 21, 1992) begins \"Special thanks to Nick Beltrante for a great news tip, the late Ralph Reppert for showing the way, Howard and Katie Donahue for casting their lot with me ...\".\n\nDonahue's reconstruction of the trajectories of the shots that struck Kennedy and Governor Connally supported the single-bullet theory for the second shot. Donahue decided that the impossible trajectory suggested by the Warren Commission was only necessary because there was an error in their positioning of Connally. He also concluded that this was Oswald's second shot, the first having missed owing to the misalignment of the rifle's telescopic sight but with a ricochet fragment slightly wounding Kennedy, and that Oswald had not fired a third shot, the third cartridge case found at the scene having been a slightly bent and empty one kept in the rifle's chamber.\n\nNeither Donahue nor Menninger commented on whether the Warren Commission's key finding, that Oswald acted alone, was correct or not. Menninger notes that the theory is consistent with Oswald being involved in a conspiracy. The term \"cover-up\" is mentioned in the book, rather than \"conspiracy\".\n\nThe book takes the overall form of a narrative, in which Menninger describes Donahue's enquiries over twenty-five years.\n\nChapter 1, \"A Chance Telephone Call\", describes the events that led to Donahue's interest in the assassination, and a brief biography up until that point.\n\nChapters 2 and 3, \"The Warren Report\" and \"The Critics\", then give the context and summary of the report, and a detailed summary of its critics as of 1968.\n\nChapter 4, \"The Single Bullet Theory\" presents Donahue's analysis of the shot which, according to the Warren Commission, struck both Kennedy and Connally, and suggests that the \"magic bullet\" trajectory is only necessary because the estimated position of the Governor was wrong. One of Oswald's shots could therefore have caused both men's injuries as claimed, but there remain other unanswered questions.\n\nChapter 5, \"The Head Shot\" describes Donahue's analysis of the shot that hit Kennedy in the head, using the Warren Commission evidence (particularly the official autopsy report), stills from the Zapruder film and other photos, and holes drilled in a plaster skull. Numerous questions arise surrounding the completeness and even accuracy of the autopsy report.\n\nChapter 6, \"A Fortuitous Encounter\", describes Donahue's first correspondence with the Secret Service, and reviews the conclusions that led to his approaching them.\n\nHe then by chance meets Dr. Russell Fisher, who led the Clark Panel which reviewed the autopsy in 1968, and who provides a copy of its report and many insights into details of the autopsy report and problems with the material provided to the panel. The suspicion of an accidental discharge by a Secret Service agent grows.\n\nChapter 7, \"Kennedy's Unknown Wound\", describes Donahue's conclusion that Kennedy suffered a scalp wound from a ricochet fragment from Oswald's first shot, using the material provided by Fisher. This resolves some problems with the timing of the reactions of Kennedy and Connally.\n\nChapter 8, \"Murphy's Law\", resumes the story of Donahue's career as his expertise and reputation as an expert witness grows.\n\nChapter 9, \"The Discovery\", describes more of Donahue's career, and his discovery of a photo showing a Secret Service agent holding a weapon that could have produced the kind of wound Kennedy suffered (the photo eventually used on the cover of the book). This revives his interest in publishing an article on his findings.\n\nChapter 10, \"Breaking News\", describes the first publication of Donahue's conclusions in articles by Ralph Reppert, and attempts to contact Hickey. Questions are asked regarding the nature of the cover-up, and particularly about whether Robert Kennedy was involved in it.\n\nChapters 11 to 13 describe Donahue's experiences with the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations.\n\nChapter 14, \"The AR-15\", describes the ill health and death of Reppert, the reporter who wrote the articles that broke the story, which ends their proposed collaboration on a book on Donahue's theory and puts the book proposal on hold. The story of the AR-15 is told, with comparisons to the M-1, AK-47, M-14, and M-16, and some very critical assessments of the adoption of the M-14 and M-16.\n\nChapter 15, \"The Final Breakthrough\", presents more ballistics, especially estimating the size of the head shot entry wound and its relevance. John Davis, another possible author for the book, is contacted and is at first enthusiastic. Howard gives up his Masters studies in forensics but becomes increasingly employed as an expert witness despite this.\n\nChapter 16, \"Hope Dies Hard\", gives a brief history of the Secret Service, their nightmare assignment guarding Kennedy, and their reaction to the shooting. There follows Hickey's involvement in the Warren Commission and statements by him and other agents. Donahue's conversation with one notable conspiracy theorist is also described.\n\nChapter 17, \"Today\", is a recap as of spring 1991, describing reactions from Secret Service agents and others to the theory, and more attempts to contact Hickey.\n\nAn afterword headed \"Note from the Publisher\" describes more attempts to contact Hickey, and to discuss the theory with the Secret Service and others, and why the decision to publish the book was taken.\n\nThere are several appendices:\n\nFinally, there are chapter by chapter endnotes giving sources and their bibliographic details, and an index.\n\nReaction to \"Mortal Error\" has been mixed. James Balducki of the Associated Press cited that Donahue's \"scrupulousness\" made his theory of the JFK assassination plausible. Balducki praised the book, saying \"Menninger interprets the story with a sharpness and fluidity that never unravels amid the surge of detail\". David Pietrusza called Donahue's theory unusual due to him not tying the assassination to Mafia, CIA, or FBI, but that there were \"still problems with Donahue's theory\". The Hamilton Spectator criticized \"Mortal Error\" as \"missing the mark\".\n\nPre-publication orders topped 100,000, but the book caused little impact at the time. Menninger commented in 2013 that it might be because Donahue's theory was \"equally disliked by both conspiracy theorists and supporters of the Warren Commission.\"\n\nHoward Donahue died in 1999. In \"The Smoking Gun\" documentary, his daughter Colleen Donahue Lorenzen remembers her father being surprised that his work aroused so little interest.\n\nAt the time of his death, Donahue was working on another book on the same topic.\n\nIn 2013, Australian journalist and former police detective Colin McLaren published a book and documentary both titled \"\", examining and supporting Donahue's theory.\n\nPrior to the publication of the book in 1992, both the publisher and the author contacted Hickey to invite his participation in the book and offering him a chance to respond to the allegations. In 1995 Hickey sued St. Martin's Press over the claims made in \"Mortal Error\". The suit was eventually dismissed in 1997 on the grounds that Hickey had waited too long after the book's initial publication to file against the publisher. Hickey refiled suit when the paper-back edition was published, and later settled with St Martin's Press in 1998 on undisclosed terms.\n\nSources state that Hickey died in either 2005 or 2011.\n\n\n", "id": "7723826", "categories": ["Non-fiction books about the assassination of John F.

Masyanya, an amusing and touching heroine of the witty flash-animated series that first appeared in the Russian internet on October 22 2001, has become nearly a cult figure. Oleg Kuvaev started everything on his own: he made up the characters and the stories, drew the flash-animated cartoons, recorded the sound, and uploaded the series (each of them about 3–4 minutes long) in the Internet.\n\nOleg Igorevich Kuvaev was born on 6 February 1967 in Saint Petersburg (Leningrad). He studied first at a school specializing in the English language, then at school majoring in physics and mathematics. Afterwards there were a number of higher institutions (including the Leningrad Institute of Aviation Instrumentation,Academy of Arts) and service in the Soviet Army. Then, he changed a lot of professions and places, mostly active as a painter and sculptor for more than 10 years, till the times of \"Big Worldwide Web\" come.\n\nFrom 1987 he was mainly into painting and sculpture, and from 1997 he turned to computer graphics. Kuvaev worked as a designer in several studios, in \"computer gaming\" industry as 3D animator and modeler, as web-designer, even java-programmer, in his free time experimenting with various computer technologies including freshly appearing vector animation (macromedia flash).\n\nIn 2001 he founded “Mult.ru” studio to promote \"Masyanya\". At this point it was just ten short rough-made cartoons about hooligan girl from Saint Petersburg. But success was unexpectedly explosive. This resulted in epidemic masyanization of the whole country, which is perhaps the major achievement of Kuvaev. Full of fresh indigenous humor (sometimes caustic and absurd but still kind at bottom) the series about Masyanya appealed to the young generation whose life, interests and problems they actually focused on, at the same time embodying an alternative to commercial mass-culture.\n\nThe crazy popularity of \"Masyanya\" made Oleg Kuvaev waste lots of efforts on fighting for the copyright to his own creation between 2003–2005. Oleg was forced to fight in the forefront of struggling for copyright laws in Russia which was the stronghold of piracy at this time. Many Russian companies have illegally made money on Masyanya and, what is much worse, distorted sometimes the essence of the personage. For example, Oleg Kuvaev had to apply to court to compel the closing of the shoddy commercial talk show \"At Masyanya’s\" broadcast at the Russian pop-music TV channel Muz-TV that was using this character illegally, without permission. And finally Oleg and his team has won three such trials on copyright proving that the \"times are changing\".\n\nUntil quite recently Oleg Kuvaev worked as the art-director and owner of “Mult.ru” studio. Besides \"Masyanya\", the studio has released 3 more animated cartoons series: \"Eji and Petrutchoe\", \"Six and a Half\" and \"Magazinchik Boe\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7723859", "text": "Java Classloader\n\nThe Java Class Loader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment that dynamically loads Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine. Usually classes are only loaded on demand. The Java run time system does not need to know about files and file systems because of classloaders. Delegation is an important concept to understand when learning about classloaders.\n\nA software library is a collection of related object code.\nIn the Java language, libraries are typically packaged in JAR files. Libraries can contain objects of different types. The most important type of object contained in a Jar file is a Java class. A class can be thought of as a named unit of code. The class loader is responsible for locating libraries, reading their contents, and loading the classes contained within the libraries. This loading is typically done \"on demand\", in that it does not occur until the class is called by the program. A class with a given name can only be loaded once by a given classloader.\n\nEach Java class must be loaded by a class loader. Furthermore, Java programs may make use of external libraries (that is, libraries written and provided by someone other than the author of the program) or they may be composed, at least in part, of a number of libraries.\n\nWhen the JVM is started, three class loaders are used:\n\nThe bootstrap class loader loads the core Java libraries located in the codice_1 directory. This class loader, which is part of the core JVM, is written in native code.\n\nThe extensions class loader loads the code in the extensions directories (codice_2, or any other directory specified\nby the codice_3 system property). It is implemented by the codice_4 class.\n\nThe system class loader loads code found on codice_5, which maps to the codice_6 environment variable. This is implemented by the codice_7 class.\n\nThe Java class loader is written in Java. It is therefore possible to create your own class loader without understanding the finer details of the Java Virtual Machine. Every Java class loader has a parent class loader, defined when a new class loader is instantiated or set to the virtual machine's system default class loader.\n\nThis makes it possible (for example):\n\nJava Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application servers typically load classes from a deployed WAR or EAR archive by a tree of classloaders, isolating the application from other applications, but sharing classes between deployed modules. So-called \"servlet containers\" are typically implemented in terms of multiple classloaders.\n\nJAR hell is a term similar to DLL hell used to describe all the various ways in which the classloading process can end up not working. Three ways JAR hell can occur are:\n\n\nThe OSGi Alliance specified (starting as JSR 8 in 1998) a modularity framework that aims to solve JAR hell for current and future VMs in ME, SE, and EE that is widely adopted. Using metadata in the JAR manifest, JAR files (called bundles) are wired on a per-package basis. Bundles can export packages, import packages and keep packages private, providing the basic constructs of modularity and versioned dependency management.\n\nTo remedy the JAR hell problems, a Java Community Process — JSR 277 was initiated in 2005. The resolution — Java Platform Module System — intended to introduce a new distribution format, a modules versioning scheme, and a common modules repository (similar in purpose to Microsoft .NET's Global Assembly Cache). In December 2008, Sun announced that JSR 277 was put on hold. The Java Module System was later rebooted as \"project Jigsaw\" which was included in Java 9.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7723859", "categories": [], "title": "Java Classloader"}

In India, they are found in Namsai district and Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. Smaller numbers can be found in Lakhimpur district, Dhemaji district and Munglang Khamti village in Tinsukia district of Assam and possibly in some parts of China. Khamtis have a population of 100,031 out of which 40,005 live in Arunachal Pradesh and 60,026 in Assam. However, in Myanmar their total population is estimated at 200,000 people.\n\nThe Tai Khamtis who inhabit the region around the Tengapani basin were descendants of migrants who came during the 18th century from the Hkamti long region, the mountainous valley of the Irrawaddy. The Khamti possess South East Asian features.\n\nThe Tai-Khamti are followers of Theravada Buddhism. The Tai-Khamti have their own script for their language, known as 'Lik Tai', which was originated from the Shan (Tai) script of Myanmar. Their mother tongue is known as Khamti language. It is a Tai language, closely related to Thai and Lao.\n\nThe Khamti society is divided into classes, each signifying distinct status in the social hierarchy. The chiefs occupy the highest positions, followed by the priests, who wield considerable influence over all ranks. In the past, the slaves constituted the lowest rank.\n\nThe Tai-Khamti are very strong believers of Theravada Buddhism. Houses have a prayer room, and they pray every morning and evening by offerings flowers (nam taw yongli) and food (khao tang som). They are peace-loving people.\n\nHouses of the Tai-Khampti are built on raised floors with thatched roofs. The roofs are constructed so low that the walls remain concealed. Wooden planks are used for flooring, and the walls are made of bamboo splices.\n\nThe Khamti are settled, agriculturists. They use a plough (thaie) drawn by a single animal, either an ox or a buffalo (or even an elephant in olden days).\n\nThe Khamti raise crops such as paddy rice (khow), mustard/sesame seeds (nga) and potato (man-kala). Their staple food is rice, usually supplemented by vegetables, meat and fish. They drink a beer made from rice (low) as a beverage that is not served during festivals. Some of the well-known dishes are \"khao puk\" (made out of sticky rice and sesame seeds), \"khao lam\" (bamboo rice), \"paa sa\" (fresh river fish soup with special herbs), \"paa som\", and \"nam som\" among others. Beef is considered taboo.\n\nKhamti is a Southwestern Tai language spoken in Myanmar and India by the Khamti people. It is a Daic language, specifically Kadai, Kam-Tai, Tai, Southwestern, Northwest branch. The language seems to have originated around Mogoung in Upper Myanmar. It is closely related to Thai and Lao languages.\n\nThree dialects of Khamti are known: North Burma Khamti, Assam Khamti, and Sinkaling Khamti. Speakers of Khamti are bilingual, largely in Assamese and Burmese.\n\nCurrently, there are about 200,000 Khamti speakers in Myanmar and 130,00 in the northeastern part of India (Arunachal Pradesh and Assam areas)\n\nThe Tai Khamtis have their own writing character called 'Lik-Tai.'\n\nTai-Khampti alphabet, which is in pristine form, closely resembles Northern Shan alphabet of Myanmar with some of the letters taking divergent shapes. Their script is evidently derived from the Lik Hto Ngauk script since hundreds of years ago. There are 35 letters including 17 consonants and 14 vowels. The script is traditionally taught in monasteries on subjects like tripitaka, Jataka tales, code of conduct, doctrines and philosophy, history, law codes, astrology, and palmistry etc. The first printed book was published in 1960. In 1992 it was edited by the Tai Literature Committee, Chongkham. In 2003 it was again modified with tone marking by scholars of Northern Myanmar and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nThe traditional Khamti dress of men is a full-sleeved cotton shirt (siu pachai) and multi-coloured lungi (phanoi). The women's dress consists of a blouse (siu pasao), a deep-coloured long skirt (sinn) made from cotton or silk, and a coloured silk scarf (famai). Married woman wear in plain black long wrap-around skirt (sinn) and above that a shorter green wrap-around skirt (langwat).\n\nTheir jewelry consists of bright amber earrings, coral, beaded necklaces and gold ornaments. The Khamti men usually tattoo their bodies.\n\nThe Khamti tie their hair into a large knot, which is supported by a white turban (fa-ho). The chiefs wear a long coat made of silk. The hair is drawn up from the back and sides in one massive roll, measuring four to five inches in length. An embroidered band, the fringed and tasseled ends of which hang down behind, encircles the roll.\n\nThe Khamti are renowned for their craftsmanship. Their sword is known as pha-nap. Their priests are known to be amateur craftsmen, who use wood, bone or ivory to carve religious statues.\n\nIt is believed that by shaping ivory handles of weapons they will evince great skill. Their weapons include poisoned bamboo spikes (panjis), spear, bow and arrow, sword, and shield, usually made of rhinoceros or buffalo hide. The Khamti also have firearms which resemble old flint muskets and horse pistols. The sword is carried on the front of the body so that its hilt can be grasped in the right hand if needed.\n\nThe dance \"Ka Poong Tai\" is one of the main dramatic art forms of the Tai Khamtis. Unlike many forms of traditional Arunachali dance, the Khamti dance is a dance drama, expressively and elegantly reflect the rich culture of the Khamti Buddhists.\n\nThe traditional folk dances of the Tai Khamtis have their roots in Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Myanmar. The community has many folk dances and each dance has a religious background. Some of the popular Tai Khamti dance dramas are:\n\n\nSangken is the main festival of Khamti. It is celebrated on 14 April. The true colors of secular India are at the Sangken festival where people irrespective of their tribe, caste, culture, race, etc., participate in the rituals.\n\nThe main attraction of the festival is splashing clean water, which is the symbol of peace and purity. The images of Buddha are taken out and after the ceremonial bath. The procession is accompanied by drums, dances, and enjoyment. This holy bath of is an auspicious event. The celebration takes place for three consecutive days. During the celebration, the locals make homemade sweet and distribute them. The exchange of gifts is a common trait of the festival.\n\nThere are festivals other than Sangken celebrated throughout the year. Some of the festivals are Poi-Pee-Mau (Tai Khampti New Year), Mai-Kasung-Phai, Khoa-Wa, Poat-Wa, etc.\n\n\n \n", "id": "7723878", "categories": ["Social groups of Assam", "Ethnic groups in Myanmar", "Ethnic groups in Northeast India", "Buddhist communities of India", "Buddhist communities of Myanmar", "Tribes of Arunachal Pradesh", "Buddhist communities", "Tribes of Assam"], "title": "Khamti people"}

Wait for his deceased son Elbert.\n\nElberton was incorporated as a fourth class town on 24 April 1896. It grew to have a population of 500 and at one time had a sawmill, a flour mill, a railroad (the Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company) that passed through and the world's largest prune dryer.\n\nA major fire started in the town in the 1930s and due to the Great Depression, many of the businesses and homes destroyed by the fire were too costly to rebuild. The fire, along with the Depression hurt the town greatly and it started to decline in population, with people packing up what they could carry and abandoning their homes that they could no longer afford to keep and maintain.\n\nIn November 1966, residents of Elberton voted 15–5 in favor of dis-incorporation.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS \"Voyager\" after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far from the rest of the Federation. The episode marks the last appearance of Kes until the episode, \n\nAfter , USS \"Voyager\" still remains without working warp propulsion and is infested with Borg technology. Seven of Nine, the Borg drone saved from the destruction of her cube, has her connection with the Borg collective severed. She is now able to function as an individual, but she is shocked by the change and still refers to herself in the first person plural. Her body nevertheless starts to heal and reject Borg technology. The Doctor decides that he should remove her Borg implants so she can recover.\n\nThe Doctor hesitates to operate on a patient who refuses medical attention, but Captain Janeway, who believes that Seven of Nine is unable to make decisions for herself in her current state, convinces him to do it. During the operation, she starts to have a seizure, caused by an implant in her brain. Kes uses her increasingly powerful telepathic abilities to disable the implant and stop the seizure.\n\nThe Doctor removes as much of the technology as possible, save for those that are too much part of her vital systems, but Seven of Nine is upset by the result. She is not used to being an individual and she repeatedly demands that she be returned to the Collective. Janeway refuses, and asks her to help with removing the Borg technology in \"Voyager\"s systems.\n\nMeanwhile, Kes and Tuvok meditate. Kes has learned to manipulate matter on a subatomic level, and begins to see beyond even that.\n\nAs Seven of Nine begins her work on repairs, she is closely guarded by Harry Kim and a security guard. While looking at the hardware, Seven sees a transmitter, and her Borg impulses are sparked into action by the stimulus. She pushes Ensign Kim out of the room, shuts the door and barricades herself in the room. She accesses a subspace transmitter and tries to send a message to the Borg. Kes senses that something is wrong and uses her abilities to send an electrical surge that stops Seven.\n\nSeven is held in the brig, where she has a long talk with Janeway about her separation from the Collective. Meanwhile, Neelix and Kes talk about their past. She tells him about her new powers and demonstrates them. Neelix is hurt as the table they were sitting at starts to change. The ship's structural integrity begins to destabilize. When Janeway and Tuvok enter the room, they see Kes on the floor and her body changing - destabilizing at the subatomic level, as Tuvok explains. The Doctor is unable to explain this reaction; he only knows that her powers must be suppressed or she might die.\n\nSeven of Nine unsuccessfully tries to break through the brig's forcefield. Janeway comes inside her cell with information about her past. Before assimilation, she was a human girl named Annika Hansen.

It is identified by its complex biseriate conidiophores on which phialides produce asexual spores. It can grow at fairly low temperatures (it is a psychrophile), and in low water activity environments.\n\n\"Penicillium crustosum\" produces mycotoxins, most notoriously the neurotoxic penitrems, including the best known penitrem toxin, penitrem A, and including penitrems A through G. Penitrem G has been shown to have insecticidal activity. In addition, \"P. crustosum\" can produce thomitrems A and E, and roquefortine C. Consumption of foods spoiled by this mold can cause transient neurological symptoms such as tremors. In dogs, symptoms can include vomiting, convulsion, tremors, ataxia, and tachycardia.\n", "id": "7724083", "categories": ["Fungi described in 1930", "Penicillium"], "title": "Penicillium crustosum"}

The Ritchey-Chrétien reflecting telescope is notable for the design of telescope mount. Instead of the typical mounting where the telescope moves on two rotating axes, the mirror end of the telescope is supported by six extensible struts, an arrangement known as a Stewart platform. This configuration allows the telescope to move in all six spatial degrees of freedom and also provides strong structural integrity. As a result, the ratio of bearing pressure and its own weight is very high. Furthermore, the six-leg structure allows for a very precise positioning and repeatability. The disadvantage of the system is that controlling and aiming a hexapod-mounted telescope is much more complex than with conventional telescope mounts.\n\nThe mounting was designed by engineers of the company Vertex, in collaboration with astronomers of the Astronomy Institute of the Ruhr University Bochum (AIRUB) in Germany. Led by Prof. Rolf Chini, the HPT was thoroughly tested at AIRUB. In 2006, it was moved to its new location on Cerro Armazones Observatory in the Atacama Desert in Chile. AIRUB, in collaboration with the Astronomy Department of the Catholic University of the North (UCN), is developing an observatory there. A new control building was built next to the HPT on the summit of Cerro Murphy, a subsidiary peak of Cerro Armazones.\n\nTogether with the Landessternwarte Heidelberg-Königstuhl, AIRUB developed the Bochum Echelle Spectrograph for the Optical (BESO) for the HPT.

It mitigates the effect of the horizon problem faced by AI engines for various games like chess and Go.\n\nHuman players usually have enough intuition to decide whether to abandon a bad-looking move, or search a promising move to a great depth. A quiescence search attempts to emulate this behavior by instructing a computer to search \"interesting\" positions to a greater depth than \"quiet\" ones to make sure there are no hidden traps and to get a better estimate of its value.\n\nAny sensible criterion may be used to distinguish \"quiet\" moves from \"noisy\" moves; high activity (high movement on a chess board, extensive capturing in Go, for example) is commonly used for board games. As the main motive of quiescence search is usually to get a good value out of an imperfect evaluation function, it may also make sense to detect wide fluctuations in values returned by a simple heuristic evaluator over several ply. Modern chess engines may search certain moves up to 2 or 3 times deeper than the minimum. In highly \"unstable\" games like Go and reversi, a rather large proportion of computer time may be spent on quiescence searching.\n\nThe horizon effect is a problem in artificial intelligence which can occur when a search of a game tree is limited. In many games, the number of possible states or positions is too great for an exhaustive search to be practical. Computer programs search a subset of the game tree and use heuristics to estimate the value of individual positions. Due to the limitation of this search, it's possible for the computer to identify a move that is optimal up to the given search depth, but that leads to a suboptimal position beyond that depth, of which the computer is unaware. Quiescence search attempts to mitigate this issue by extending the search depth in high activity positions where the heuristic value may have significant fluctuations between moves.\n\nThis pseudocode illustrates the concept algorithmically:\n", "id": "7724220", "categories": ["Computer chess", "Game artificial intelligence"], "title": "Quiescence search"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7724252", "text": "Shell-Haus\n\nThe Shell-Haus (Shell House) is a classical modernist architectural masterpiece that stands overlooking the Landwehrkanal in the Tiergarten district of Berlin, Germany. It was designed by Emil Fahrenkamp and was built in 1930–31.\n\nIn 1929 a competition was held between five architects to determine the designer of a prestigious new office block to house the headquarters of the mineral oil company, and Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary, Rhenania-Ossag. The victor was the German architect and professor Emil Fahrenkamp (1885-1966).\n\nAfter almost two years in construction, Shell-Haus opened in 1932. At the time the building was noted for its modernist design, for its striking wave-like facade, and for being one of the first steel-framed high-rise buildings in Berlin. In retrospect it is regarded as Fahrenkamp’s masterpiece and one of the most significant office block designs of the Weimar Republic. \n\nShell-Haus' simple graceful forms are stylistically reminiscent of the German modern realist movement New Objectivity, but Fahrenkamp also incorporated more traditional aspects to his design. \n\nThe most eye-catching feature of Shell-Haus is its main facade, which jumps forward in six gentle waves whilst at the same time increasing in height from six levels (five at the back) to ten. The building itself comprises four wings situated around a four-sided inner courtyard.\n\nBefore the building of Shell-Haus, the Tiergarten section of Berlin was primarily the location of expensive, elegant and luxurious private residences. Afterwards, and after World War II, the area housed more offices, with some of the former townhouses and villas gone and others having been converted to office use. The street itself became a significant connecting thoroughfare.\n\nDuring the Second World War Shell-Haus was used by the naval high command and the cellars were converted into a makeshift hospital. \n\nDespite the upper floors being damaged in the Battle of Berlin at the close of the war, Shell-Haus was one of Berlin’s few great edifices to survive the widespread destruction of the city relatively unscathed. After clearing away the war damage, in 1946 the Berlin electricity board BEWAG made Shell-Haus its head office. \n\nIn 1958 Shell-Haus was designated an historical monument in order to protect it. However, this acknowledgement of its architectural importance did not save the building from post-war dilapidation, and it remained in a degraded state for many years to follow.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1967, the Shell-Haus site was extended northwards with the construction of two similarly steel-framed buildings designed by the German architect Paul Baumgarten. Being comparatively conventional and unremarkable in design, they were not included under the original building’s historical monument protection, and a 1995 application to rectify this was squashed.\n\nWhen the subject of the building's long overdue restoration was raised in the 1980s progress was hampered by a dispute over the investment needed that continued into the mid-1990s. Renovation work had been carried out on the courtyard façade in the early 80s but this had failed to meet the required standards.\n\nIn 1995 Bewag moved out of Shell-Haus in readiness for the renovation project. In 1997, after 13 years of discord, the restoration work began. At the time the total cost was estimated at around 50 million deutschmarks. but by the time work was completed in February 2000, the expenditure had escalated to around 80 million marks. A major contributory factor to the considerable expense was the need to reopen the Longarina quarry near Rome, owned by company CIMEP in Tivoli, in order to supply the appropriate travertine rock for the building façade.\n\nThe expenditure and painstaking detail invested in Shell-Haus did not go unrewarded – the year 2000 saw the renovation work awarded the monument preservation prize, the Ferdinand von Quast Medal.\n\nIn March 2000 the Berlin energy supplier GASAG became the new owner and occupant of Shell-Haus.\n\nShell-Haus has several high-profile fans including the acclaimed German film director Wim Wenders – who featured the building in his 1970 directorial debut \"Summer in the City\" – and the architect Meinhard von Gerkan, who said that for him it was the most beautiful building in Berlin.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the only times on record that Adolf Hitler inveighed against a specific building in Berlin, as opposed to modern urban architecture in general, was when he insulted Fahrenkamp with \"You're the man who committed the crime of the Shell Building.\" Despite this criticism, Fahrenkamp received some commissions for exhibition buildings, and had dealings with Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring, the head of the Luftwaffe and the Four Year Plan, and Albert Speer, Hitler's favorite architect and later Minister of Armaments and War Production.\n", "id": "7724252", "categories": ["Buildings and structures in Berlin"], "title": "Shell-Haus"}

It was led by members of the Civic Union (which would later give rise to the modern Radical Civic Union) against the presidency of Miguel Juárez Celman (of the National Autonomist Party). Though it failed in its main goals, the revolution forced Juárez Celman's resignation and marked the decline of the elite of the Generation of '80.\n\nNear the end of 1889, general discontent (mainly due to high inflation) encouraged the Civic Union (led by Aristóbulo del Valle and Leandro Alem) to attempt to oust President Miguel Juárez Celman, whose conservative rule, like those of previous presidents, had been marked by electoral fraud and corruption.\n\nThe uprising was led by a civil revolutionary junta and by General Manuel J. Campos. It counted on the indirect support of General and former President Julio Argentino Roca and on the lack of opposition by General Bartolomé Mitre.\nThe uprising started on 26 July 1890 at the Buenos Aires Artillery Park. It met with swift repression on the part of the government forces, led by generals Carlos Pellegrini (the Vice-President), Roque Sáenz Peña, and Nicolás Lavalle. Lacking initiative and ammunition, the revolutionaries were defeated in a matter of days, but the image of the government had suffered. Senator Pizarro demanded the resignation of the entire Executive Branch and the Senate, presided by General Roca, but President Juárez Celman was the only one to accept. Vice-President Pellegrini took office in his stead, to complete the remaining two years of his presidential term. \nThe Revolution of the Park was intended as a means to \"avoid the ruin of the country\" by bringing down \"a government that represents illegality and corruption\", according to its Manifesto. The revolutionary junta rejected \"living without voice or vote..., witness the disappearance of rules, principles, guarantees..., tolerate the usurpation of our political rights..., and keeping those in power who have wrought the disgrace of the republic\", and denounced that \"there is no republic, no federal system, no representative government, no administration, no morality. Political life has turned into a for-profit industry.\" \n\nThe success of the revolution was limited to the resignation of Juárez Celman, who had been notorious for his corruption and abuse of power.

Its nearest English equivalent is \"a hard act to follow\". The difficulties alluded to may be both practical and psychological in nature, and are sometimes related to the aspect of the situation that no one really cares how you are doing, as the surroundings might have spent all their attention forces and enthusiasm admiring and applauding your predecessor. The etymology of this eponymous idiom relates to the Norwegian ski jumper Bjørn Wirkola. Since Wirkola would be the \"a priori\" and \n\"a posteriori\"\nstar of any event he participated in, spectator attention and excitement levels were building up in the minutes leading up to any of his ski jumps, with appropriate crescendo and forte fortissimo culmination during his flying through the air – inadvertently causing the next participant, regardless of fame, nationality or ability, to jump in and into the vacuum of tired spectator silence.\n\n", "id": "7724363", "categories": ["Ski jumping in Norway", "Norwegian language"], "title": "Jumping after Wirkola"}

His most prolific period of painting and drawing occurred between 1816 and 1831.\n\nAlken was born on 12 October 1785 in Soho, Westminster, and baptised on 6 November at St James's Church, Piccadilly. He was the third son of Samuel Alken, a sporting artist. Two of his brothers were George and Samuel Alken the Younger, also an artist. In 1789, the Alken family moved from Soho to 2, Francis Street East, Bedford Square.\n\nYoung Henry first studied under his father and then with the miniature painter John Thomas Barber Beaumont (1774–1841), also known as J. T. Barber. In 1801, Alken sent a miniature portrait of Miss Gubbins to the Royal Academy Exhibition. He exhibited a second miniature at the Royal Academy before abandoning miniature painting and taking on painting and illustrating. Early in his career, he painted sporting subjects under the name of \"Ben Tally-O\". Alken married Maria Gordon on 14 October 1809 at St Clement’s Church, Ipswich. On 22 August of the following year later the couple's first son was baptised. Alken went on to father five children, of whom two were artists, Samuel Henry, also a sporting artist, known as Henry Alken junior, and Sefferien junior.\n\nFrom about 1816 onwards Alken \"produced an unending stream of paintings, drawings and engravings of every type of field and other sporting activity,\" and his soft-ground etchings were often colored by hand. When Alken was 26, he and his young family lived over a shop in Haymarket that belonged to print publisher Thomas McLean of the \"Repository of Wit and Humour.\" McLean paid Alken a daily wage of thirty shillings, considered a good income at the time.\n\nAlken died in April 1851 and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Although fairly affluent for most of his career, he fell on hard times towards the end of his life and was buried at his daughter's expense.\n\nAlken worked in both oil and watercolor and was a skilled etcher. His earliest productions were published anonymously under the signature of \"Ben Tallyho\", but in 1816 he issued \"The Beauties & Defects in the Figure of the Horse comparatively delineated\" under his own name. From this date until about 1831, he produced many sets of etchings of sporting subjects mostly coloured and sometimes humorous in character, the principal of which were: \"Humorous Specimens of Riding\" 1821, \"Symptoms of being amazed\" 1822, \"Symptoms of being amused\" 1822, \"Flowers from Nature\" 1823, \"A Touch at the Fine Arts\" 1824, and \"Ideas\" 1830. Besides these he published a series of books: \"Illustrations for Landscape Scenery and Scraps from the Sketch Book of Henry Alken\" in 1823, \"New Sketch Book\" in 1824, \"Sporting Scrap Book\" and \"Shakespeare's Seven Ages\" in 1827, \"Sporting Sketches\" and in 1831 Illustrations to Popular Songs and Illustrations of Don Quixote, the latter engraved by John Christian Zeitter.\n\nAlken provided the plates picturing hunting, coaching, racing and steeplechasing for \"The National Sports of Great Britain\" (London, 1821). Alken, known as an avid sportsman,is best remembered for his hunting prints, many of which he engraved himself until the late 1830s. (Charles Lane British Racing Prints pp. 75–76). He created prints for the leading sporting printsellers such as S. and J. Fuller, Thomas McLean, and Rudolph Ackermann, and often collaborated with his friend the sporting journalist Charles James Apperley (1779–1843), also known as Nimrod. Nimrod's \"Life of a Sportsman\", with 32 etchings by Alken, was published by Ackermann in 1842. In many of his etchings, Alken explored the comic side of riding and satirized the foibles of aristocrats, much in the tradition of other early 19th century omthe oldest of the great foxhound packs in Leicestershire. A collection of his illustrations can be seen in the print department of the British Museum.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7724383", "categories": ["1785 births", "1851 deaths", "19th-century English painters", "Animal artists", "English male painters", "English watercolourists", "English engravers", "Painters from London", "Military art"], "title": "Henry Thomas Alken"}

In 1977, Bashlachev graduated from Cherepovets High School in Cherepovets, and worked as a painter at the Cherepovets Metallurgical Plant with his father. In 1978, he resigned from the plant to enroll at the Ural State University in Yekaterinburg (then called Sverdlovsk) as a journalism major. Bashlachev graduated in 1983.\n\nIn early 1983, Bashlachev wrote \"Griboyedov Waltz\", which was the first song he had written. Throughout the 1980s, Bashlachev wrote and composed music. After he graduated at the Ural State University, Bashlachev left Sverdlovsk and returned to Cherepovets, where he worked for a year with the newspaper \"The Communist\". There, he wrote articles about the power plant, and, later, about cafés.\n\nIn May 1984, Bashlachev attended the Leningrad Rock Festival in Leningrad. There, he bought an acoustic guitar which he had taught himself to play. In September, he played some of his songs at his friend Leonid Parfyonov's apartment in Leningrad. Over the years, he would play several flat concerts. It is worth noting that rock music was censored in Russia during the 1970s and the 1980s. To get around this, musicians played for small audiences at their homes or at the homes of their friends. These gatherings were called \"kvartirniks\". In October, Bashlachev met music journalist Artem Troitsky, who invited Bashlachev to Moscow to write and compose music. In December 1984, Bashlachev settled in Leningrad.\n\nIn March 1985, Bashlachev along with Yuri Shevchuk played at the Leningrad Rock Festival. The two performed before an audience of six hundred concertgoers at the Leningrad Veterinary Institute in Leningrad. A recording of this concert was released under the title of \"Kochegarka\". Officially a worker at a coal boiler station, popularly known as Kamchatka (it also served as an underground rock venue), Bashlachev became a member of the Leningrad Rock Club. In June 1987 he performed at the Leningrad Rock Festival for the second and final time, and was awarded there Nadezhda (Hope) prize.\n\nShortly before his death, Bashlachev had difficulties with writer's block, rarely writing new songs and tending to avoid performing old ones. His last song, entitled \"Cherry\", was written in August 1987. He also became more isolated as his depression grew more severe.\n\nOn February 17, 1988, Bashlachev died after falling from the window of the ninth floor of an apartment on Kuznetsov Avenue in Leningrad. The most likely cause of his death, though unverified, was suicide. He was buried at the Kovalevskoye Cemetery in the Leningrad Oblast.

During World War II he learned Japanese and worked at Bletchley Park and Washington decoding Japanese naval intelligence. It was at Bletchley Park that he met his future wife, Janet Crockett Clark, whom he married in 1947.\n\nReturning to Cambridge in 1948 with a research fellowship at St John's College, Laslett edited Robert Filmer's political writings (\"Patriarcha and Other Political Writings\", 1949). According to noted historian J.G.A. Pocock, it was with this work that Laslett provided the initial inspiration for the 'Cambridge School' of the history of political thought, the methods of which are now widely practised throughout the profession. Laslett combined such academic activity with a lifelong concern to engage a wider audience. He worked simultaneously as a BBC radio producer for the Third Programme. One product of this desire to reach a wider audience was his pathbreaking and highly-popular book \"The World We Have Lost: England Before the Industrial Age\" (1965; US edition, 1966), issued in a second edition in 1971 and in a retitled third revised edition, \"The World We Have Lost: Further Explored\" (1983; US edition, 1984). Simon Mitton credits Laslett with having launched in 1948 the radio broadcasting career of the astronomer Fred Hoyle.\n\nIn 1953, Laslett was appointed a university lecturer in history at Cambridge, and was elected a fellow Trinity College in the same year. He continued work in the history of political theory, discovering Locke's library and demonstrating (against the accepted account) that John Locke's \"Two Treatises on Government\" had been written prior to the English \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688–9, remarking that the \"\"Two Treatises\" is an Exclusion Tract, not a Revolution Pamphlet.\" Laslett published an edition of the treatises in 1960, subsequently reprinted many times, which is now recognised as the definitive account of these pillars of modern liberal democracy. From 1957 he founded and co-edited \"Philosophy, Politics and Society\", a series of collections on political philosophy.\n\nLaslett took up an entirely different line of historical research from the early 1960s. Trying to understand 17th-century listings of the inhabitants of Clayworth and Cogenhoe, Northamptonshire, he became persuaded of the need to pursue historical demography more systematically. In 1964, Laslett and Tony Wrigley co-founded the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure. With funding from the Social Science Research Council, the Cambridge Group worked alongside amateur volunteers on local records, and established the journal \"Local Population Studies\".\n\nLaslett's practical reformism found an outlet from the 1960s in his efforts, together with Michael Young, to develop the Open University. In 1963 he ran a series of 5 programmes on Anglia Television, the \"Dawn University\", which attracted a great deal of attention although the funding had to wait two more years until Harold Wilson took up the idea.\n\nWhen told of his family history of Kent yeomen back to 1600 he looked it over and said \"Good. Not a gentleman in 400 years.\"\n\nLaslett was Reader in Politics and the History of Social Structure at Cambridge University (the title reflecting his own unusual mix of historical interests) from 1966 until retirement in 1983. At this point, his interests turned to the historical understanding and practical betterment of the elderly. Laslett played a pivotal role in founding the University of the Third Age in 1982.\n\nHe died in 2001, aged 85, and was interred at Wolvercote Cemetery in Oxford, and was survived by his wife Janet, sons George and Robert, and grandchildren, Vivian, Alden and Claire.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7724474", "text": "Juliana (poem)\n\n\"Juliana\" (Exeter Book, fol. 65b–76a), is one of the four signed poems ascribed to the mysterious poet, Cynewulf, and is an account of the martyring of St. Juliana of Nicomedia. The one surviving manuscript, dated between 970 and 990, is preserved in the Exeter Book between the poems \"The Phoenix\" and \"The Wanderer\". \"Juliana\" is one of only five Old English poetic texts that describe the lives of saints. (The others include \"Elene\", \"Andreas\", and \"Guthlac A\" and \"B\".)\n\nJuliana is Cynewulf's second longest work, totaling 731 lines. However, due to damage to the Exeter Book over time--such as staining, charring, and the loss of pages---there are two gaps in the text of Juliana, amounting to a loss of 130 to 140 lines. Through comparative analyses, it has been determined that no more than a single page worth of material could be missing from either gap, and it is therefore very likely that a single sheet, which would have been folded in the middle to form two pages, was accidentally lost when the original manuscript was being bound.\n\nCynewulf’s \"Juliana\" is presented entirely in Old English alliterative verse and is transmitted in a late West-Saxon dialect. Cynewulf likely derived the poem from earlier Latin accounts of the same story--similar to those appearing in the Acta sanctorum or the Martyrology; however, it is likely that Cynewulf was adapting his version from an unknown Latin source that has since been lost.\n\nThe Juliana story takes place during the Diocletian persecution and was probably first set in writing during the rule of Constantine I. The story begins by illustrating the harsh life for Christians under the rule of Galerius Maximian, describing various acts of violence visited upon Christians. Juliana is introduced as the daughter of Africanus of Nicomedia, who has promised Juliana’s hand in marriage to Eleusias, a wealthy senator and friend of Maximian. Although Juliana was born a pagan, she has converted to Christianity, and so she vehemently resists being married to the pagan Eleusias, not wanting to violate the relationship she shares with God.\n\nWhen she publicly voices her dissatisfaction, Eleusias becomes outraged and insists that he has been publicly insulted. Africanus, upon hearing of this, becomes similarly outraged, believing his daughter has embarrassed him by refusing the hand of a man of much higher status. As a result, Africanus declares that Eleusias is free to punish Juliana in whatever way he wishes.\n\nEleusias proceeds to have Juliana stripped naked, hung from a tree by her hair, whipped, and beaten with rods for over two hours. Then she is thrown into prison.\n\nWhile in prison, Juliana is visited by a demon pretending to be an angel of God, who tries to trick her into blasphemy. Juliana, being the epitome of unwavering Christian faith, doesn’t fall for the charade and prays to God for guidance. A voice tells her to reach out and grab the demon, and Juliana obeys.\n\nThis point forward contains the bulk of the story, in which Juliana and the demon have a lengthy war of words, with Juliana clearly dominating. She holds the demon and forces it to confess all of its wicked deeds several times over, ostensibly humiliating him forever in the kingdom of Hell.\n\nAfter her victory over the visiting demon, Eleusias comes back for Juliana and seems to offer her a chance to change her mind. Not surprisingly, Juliana refuses him once again, and just as scathingly as before.\n\nEleusias then attempts to have Juliana burned alive in hot lead. Yet, even though he has Juliana placed in the fire, not a spot on her body or clothes is touched by the flames. Angrier than ever, Eleusias finally resolves to have Juliana beheaded, for which she becomes a Christian martyr.\n\nThe entire story as told by Cynewulf deviates little from the Latin source he likely used, with the same “progress of action” and “phraseology” observed in both texts. However, there are some unsubtle differences worth mentioning. One is that the character of Eleusius is portrayed in Cynewulf’s text with a much more sinister and intolerant manner to his behaviour. In the \"Acta Sanctorum\", Eleusius is presented as an “easy-going man,” willing to accept Christianity just as long as he is not baptized: a practice that would compromise his position as a powerful senator.\n\nIn Cynewulf’s version, however, Eleusias eagerly worships the heathen gods, and his faith in the “devil-inspired idols” is equitable to Juliana’s faith in her own Christian God. Thus, Cynewulf polarizes Juliana and Eleusius in a way that is analogous to the conflict of good and evil. In fact, Cynewulf may have been trying to play on an Anglo-Saxon idea of a social construct called a \"dryht\". The argument goes that, according to Anglo-Saxon ethos, a good king is a provider who earns the loyalty of those he governs. Cynewulf could have used this notion to illustrate a clear difference between Juliana’s God (the “good king”) and Satan\\pagan gods (the \"bad king\"). This is evident in the fact that Juliana is repeatedly guided and protected (with the one exception of the beheading) while the demon, an agent of Satan, is coerced into serving his master and is offered no guidance or protection.\n\nA further difference to be noted between Cynewulf's \"Juliana\" and its counterpart in the \"Acta Sanctorum\" include the author's omission of Juliana's insistence that she will only marry Eleusius if he becomes a prefect. This was likely left out by Cynewulf to show Juliana as a polished saint and further magnify her polarization to Eleusius. There is also an important stylistic difference attributed to the adaptation efforts of Cynewulf; namely, the importing of military or battlefield language into the story. Although this is a recurring theme in both Latin and Old English literature, the military language does not appear in the Latin counterparts, such as the \"Acta Sanctorum\", and so it is believed that Cynewulf probably wove it in for two possible reasons: the first being to make Juliana easier to relate to; the second, to create the metaphor that Juliana’s spirit was a sort of impenetrable fortress, impervious to the attacks of Satan and his demonic henchmen.\n\nIt is said that Cynewulf's Juliana seems to lack the emotional vigour and imagination of some of the poet’s other compositions. The language is thought to be “less elaborate,” but still maintains the rhetorical cunning that Cynewulf is accustomed to. As in his Elene, the Old English tradition of placing the characters and events of the story in a heroic setting is upheld; Juliana is celebrated as a martyr who defeats the advances of the devil. The idea of a woman figuring prominently in a tale such as this was not new to Anglo-Saxons. Germanic literature often permitted women to play instrumental roles in the heroic setting of events. For instance, through Bede’s writings we hear of such women providing the stimulus for political and religious developments in Britain.\n\n", "id": "7724474", "categories": [], "title": "Juliana (poem)"}

This force advanced to within 30 kilometers of Chinchow when it received an order to withdraw. The operation was cancelled by Japanese War Minister General Jirō Minami, due to the acceptance of modified form of a League of Nations proposal for a \"neutral zone\" to be established as a buffer zone between the Republic of China proper and Manchuria pending a future China-Japanese peace conference by the civilian government of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijirō in Tokyo.\n\nHowever the two sides failed to reach a lasting agreement. The Wakatsuki government soon fell and was replaced by a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai. Further negotiations with the Kuomintang government failing, the Japanese government approved an increase in the military forces in Manchuria. In December, the rest of the 20th Infantry Division, along with the 38th Mixed Brigade of the 19th Infantry Division were sent into Manchuria from Korea while the 8th Mixed Brigade, 10th Infantry Division was sent from Japan.\n\nFollowing the defeat of General Ma Zhanshan in Heilongjiang province, and in anticipation of reinforcements, a new Japanese offensive was launched in Manchuria on December 21. General Honjo insisted that his troops were moving out \"to clear the country of bandits,\" and added that the Chinese evacuation of Chinchow was \"absolutely imperative\". Most of the \"bandits\" were actually the organizing Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies but some real bandits were also exploiting the chaos following the collapse of the Chinese government and its Northeastern Army following the Mukden Incident and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.\n\nWhile the other Japanese forces and collaborationist Manchurian troops spread out from their bases along the South Manchurian Railway rail lines to clear the countryside, from Mukden, the Japanese headquarters in Manchuria, the brigades of the 12th Infantry Division advanced southward in the night, supported by squadrons of Japanese bombers to force the Chinese to evacuate Jinzhou.\n\nThe Japanese estimated the Chinese at Jinzhou had 84,000 defenders, with 58 artillery pieces placed to support two separate systems of entrenchments defending the city. The Chinese first defensive line, 20 miles north of the city, was a series of trenches aimed to stop the Japanese advance at the Taling River Bridge on the Peiping-Mukden Railway. The Chinese had a second line of earthworks and entrenchments completely encircling Jinzhou to fall back on if the Japanese forces broke through the first line.\n\nJapanese Lieutenant General Jirō Tamon's troops cautiously advanced south from Mukden. The temperature was 30 below zero, and Japanese forces were camouflaged in white. Japanese reconnaissance aircraft reported a force of at least 3,000 Chinese \"bandits\" waiting to defend Panshan County. Brushing aside these Chinese skirmishers in a series of minor clashes, Tamon prepared to meet and crush the first serious Chinese resistance, expected at Goubangzi, 50 kilometers north of Jinzhou.\n\nBy the evening of December 31, 1931, the Japanese advance guard was fifteen kilometers from Jinzhou on the banks of the Taling river. General Tamon halted briefly to bring up the rest of his 2nd Division, for the final drive on Jinzhou. The Japanese War Office announced in a radio broadcast \"The Battle of the Taling River\", setting up microphones behind the Japanese lines, arranging an elaborate hookup to broadcast the sound of firing to Tokyo, but then had to call off the broadcast when the Chinese retreated without giving combat.\n\nJapanese forces occupied Jinzhou on January 3, 1932, with the local populace waving Japanese flags homemade during the night to appease the conquerors.\n\nOn the Chinese side confusion reigned. The old government of Chiang Kai-shek at Nanjing had resigned and a new one under Premier Sun Fo had been formed. Additionally, Marshal Zhang Xueliang's defenders were in disorderly retreat toward the Great Wall, leaving only a small garrison to protect the few government functionaries who remained behind. At Nanjing Eugene Chen, the new Kuomintang Foreign Minister, asserted that his government had never ordered evacuation of Jinzhou, but, on the contrary, had ordered Marshal Zhang repeatedly to stand his ground. Nine Chinese generals in various parts of China denounced Premier Sun Fo's new government, blaming it for the humiliating loss of Jinzhou without a struggle.\n\nThe day after the fall of Jinzhou, the Imperial Japanese Army occupied Shanhaiguan, thus completing its military control over south Manchuria.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7724517", "categories": ["December 1931 events", "History of Manchuria", "1932 in Japan", "Battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War", "1931 in China", "1931 in Japan", "Conflicts in 1931", "Conflicts in 1932"], "title": "Jinzhou Operation"}

He stands in the middle of the conflicting opinions about the future of the tree, and has to decide which course to commit himself to.\n\nGoro Yabuike is a hostage negotiator. He attends an incident where an MP is being held at gunpoint. The captor's ransom note reads \"Restore the Rules of the World\". When Yabuike has a chance to shoot the hostage-taker he hesitates. The captor kills the MP, and is in turn killed by the police. Afterwards Yabuike explains that he thought he could help both men. He is suspended from duty.\n\nHe is dropped off in the middle of a mysterious forest. He comes across various people who are in a dispute about an apparently unique tree named 'Charisma' growing in a clearing in the forest.

The film has been interpreted by some as an allegorical tale about the structure of Japanese society, and the tension between the importance of individuality on the one hand, and the importance of the group on the other. It is also possible to discern an ecological message.

The final result was that the 3021 kilometers between Darwin and Adelaide were covered in a record 29 hours and 11 minutes, averaging about 103 km/h.\n\nIt has very efficient solar cells of a type normally used to power orbital satellites (as had the previous Nunas), and it has better aerodynamics and is lighter than its predecessors.\n\nIt was designed and built by 11 students from different disciplines of the Delft University of Technology, who have partly put their studies on hold for this. They used the hightech labs and workshops of the University and, as with the Nuna 2, they received advice from Wubbo Ockels, the first Dutch astronaut and professor at the University.\n\nTo have a good chance to win, the car has to:\n\nThe solar cells are made of gallium arsenide (GaAs) and consist of three layers. Sunlight that penetrates the upper layer is used in the lower layers, resulting in an efficiency of over 26%. This type of solar cell is among the best available currently. Apart from efficiency, size also matters, so the entire upper surface of the Nuna 3 is covered with them, except for the cockpit.\n\nEfficiency is optimal when the cells are hit by the solar rays perpendicularly. If not, output is reduced by roughly the cosine of the angle with the perpendicular. Because the 2005 race was held in September (as opposed to October or November in previous years) the sun was lower in the sky (it's earlier in spring). To compensate for this, as many cells as possible were placed at the sides, most notably on the wheel caps.\nA solar cell gives a certain amount of current for a certain amount of sunlight. The voltage depends on the load (more precisely the resistance of the load). The power is the product of voltage and current and therefore also depends on the load. Over a certain voltage the current of the solar cell quickly drops to zero, as the graph illustrates.\n\nHowever, the batteries have a fairly constant voltage, which also has a rather different value than that of the solar cells. So a voltage transformation is needed. A special type of DC-DC converter is used to ensure the load resistance presented to the solar cells is such that the solar cells give maximum power, so also at the top of the green line in the graph. This is called a Maximum power point tracker (MPPT). Here too, the goal is to have this conversion achieve maximum efficiency (>97%).\n\nThe aerodynamic drag is an important part of the total resistance. Important are the frontal surface and the streamline. Any deviation from the ideal streamline will cause turbulence, which costs energy. The ideal streamline is achieved in various stages:\nFrom meteorological data from the area where the contest is to take place, it can be concluded that there will likely be a strong side-wind. The wheel caps of the Nuna 3 are designed such that a sidewind will have a propulsory effect.\n\nThe electromotor is totally encased in the rear wheel to minimise loss through mechanical transmission from motor to wheel (such as in a normal car in the gear box and cardan). The motor is an improved version of the original 1993 Motor of the Spirit of Biel III by the Engineering School of Biel, Switzerland (now: Berner Fachhochschule Technik und Informatik). The improvements are due to completely redeveloped digital power electronics and control, realized 1999. They allowed for 50% more power (over 2400 W) and a 45% higher torque compared to the 1993 Spirit of Biel II. The efficiency of the total drive system (including the power electronics losses) is also improved and is now over 98%. But as the graph shows this depends somewhat on the speed and increases with speed. The design was initially made to reach its maximum performance at the normal cruising speed of the solar car at around 100 km/h.\n\nDuring one of the test drives in the Netherlands the Nuna 3 achieved a speed of 130 km/h. On the first day of the race the car achieved a top speed of 140 km/h. For comparison, the Sunraycer (the first winner of the Solar Challenge race) attained a top speed of 109 km/h in 1987.\n\nThe winner of the North American Solar Challenge from the University of Michigan (USA) was considered to be one of the most important opponents. Other important contestants were the MIT (also USA) and the Japanese Ashiya University team. In 2005 there were also two other European contestants, the Dutch Raedthuys Solar Team from the University of Twente and the Belgian Umicore Solar Team from Leuven.\n\n\nThis average speed, which could lead to maximum speeds of 140 km/h speeds on downhill section, well exceeding speed limits on the Australian highway, has led to rules changes for future races.\n\n", "id": "7724562", "categories": ["Delft University of Technology", "Dutch inventions", "Solar car racing", "Science and technology in the Netherlands", "Electric vehicles"], "title": "Nuna 3"}

It was written by lead vocalist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea, and produced by Chas Chandler. It reached No. 1 in the UK, giving the band their fifth number one single, and remained in the charts for ten weeks. The song was certified UK Silver by BPI in July 1973. The song would be included on the band's 1973 compilation album \"Sladest\".\n\nEarlier in 1973, Slade achieved their fourth number one \"Cum On Feel the Noize\", which was also the band's first single to reach the number one spot in its first week. This achievement had not been seen since The Beatles' \"Get Back\" in 1969. While on tour in America, the band entered A&M Studios in Los Angeles to record the follow-up single \"Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me\". Released in June 1973, the song also reached the top spot in its first week. It remained at No. 1 for three consecutive weeks, and sold 300,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nLea originally had the idea for the chorus of \"Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me\" after visiting the band's regular pub, The Trumpet in Bilston, where he saw local pianist Reg Kierle performing there. During the release of the song, drummer Don Powell was involved in a near-fatal car crash in July, briefly throwing the band's existence into doubt. Despite his critical condition, Powell was able to make a recovery and the band entered the studio to record material for their next album \"Old New Borrowed and Blue\" later in the year.\n\n\"Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me\" was released on 7\" vinyl by Polydor Records in the UK, Ireland, across Europe, Scandinavia, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Israel, Argentina and Japan. In America, it was released by Reprise Records. The B-side, \"Kill 'Em at the Hot Club Tonite\", was exclusive to the single and would later appear on the band's 2007 compilation \"B-Sides\". The band had briefly considered releasing the B-side as a novelty single, however Powell's car crash caused the idea to be scrapped. In America, the B-side was the \"Old New Borrowed and Blue\" album track \"My Town\".\n\nDue to Powell's car crash, no music video was filmed to promote the single. The band appeared twice on the UK music show \"Top of the Pops\" prior to Powell's crash. Afterwards, the producers of the show would not allow Slade to perform as a three-piece band, so future airings of the song showed studio audience dancing to the song instead. Prior to Powell's crash, the band also performed the song, along with its B-side, on the UK TV show \"Lift off with Ayesha\".\n\nUpon release, \"Record Mirror\" commented on Holder's vocals as being given a \"satisfactory showcase\". Although they felt the song was not dissimilar to the band's previous material, they added: \"that rolling rhythm pushes the whole thing along with alarming verve and gusto\". \"New Musical Express\" said: \"The start is fussy, and those \"whoa-whoa's\" in the chorus are a drag. The beat's strong and the words in the verses are the best yet, but all around this doesn't beat \"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\" or \"Gudbuy T'Jane\".\" American magazine \"Cash Box\" listed the single as one of their \"picks of the week\" during November 1973. They felt the song represented \"usual hard driving fare\" from the band and predicted it would \"give them their first major Stateside hit\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7724580", "categories": ["1973 songs", "1973 singles", "Slade songs", "Songs written by Jim Lea", "Song recordings produced by Chas Chandler", "Songs written by Noddy Holder", "UK Singles Chart number-one singles"], "title": "Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me"}

However, it was acknowledged that the genus \"Akysis\" was poorly-sampled at the time and may be deemed non-monophyletic in the future.\n\nIn 1998, it was recognized that the large genus \"Akysis\" includes two species groups. The first species group was the \"Akysis variegatus\" group, for species more closely related to the type species; the other group was the \"pseudobagarius\" group for species more closely related to the formerly-named \"Akysis pseudobagarius\"; the authors recognized it as conceivable that the groups represented two genera, but tentatively retained the species in a single genus. Since then, the genus \"Pseudobagarius\" was erected for this species group, leaving only members of the \"A. variegatus\" group in the genus \"Akysis\".\n\nIn 2007, \"Laguvia manipurensis\" was redescribed to the genus \"Akysis\" as part of the \"A. variegatus\" group.\n\nThere are currently 24 recognized species in this genus:\n\nThese fish are found in fast-flowing streams in Southeast Asia. This area is bordered by the Irrawaddy River drainage to the west, the Barito River drainage to the east, the Lancangjiang (upper Mekong) drainage to the north, and the Citarum River drainage to the south. \"Akysis\" have been reported from Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Tenasserim, Thailand, Myanmar, and, most recently, the distribution of \"Akysis\" has been discovered to include India.\n\nThese small catfish can be distinguished by their general colouring of yellow markings on a brown background. Fishes of the genus \"Akysis\" are diagnosed by having tough leathery skin covered with tubercles which are arranged in longitudinal rows along the sides, the anterior margin of the pectoral spine with a notch visible dorsally, the nasals with expansions beyond the canal-bearing teeth, and no palatal teeth. These fish are distinguished from the members of the genus \"Pseudobagarius\" by a number of characteristics: these species have a terminal mouth; the posterior and anterior nostrils being smaller and located further apart with a distance between the base of the nasal barbel and anterior nostril; the anterior nostrils are situated at the tip of a short tube; and the caudal fin is truncate or emarginate rathern that forked.\n\nThe maximum adult size of \"Akysis\" species is less than 70 millimetres (2.8 in) SL.\n\nCatfishes of the genus \"Akysis\" are small cryptically-coloured species. \"Akysis\" are small secretive fishes that occupy a variety of habitats. Most species typically inhabit clear swift-flowing upland streams with sandy or rocky substrates. Some species are reported from the muddy side and main channels and deltas of large rivers. In smaller streams they may be found hiding in leaf litter and woody debris, in patches of live vegetation such as \"Cryptocoryne affinis\", or in shallow riffle areas under coarse gravel or larger stones. Species of \"Akysis\" also are reported from the shallow margins to the bottom depths of large rivers where they are usually taken in trawls together with decaying vegetation.\n", "id": "7724583", "categories": ["Freshwater fish of Malaysia", "Fish of Cambodia", "Catfish genera", "Akysidae", "Fish of Thailand", "Taxa named by Pieter Bleeker", "Fish of Myanmar", "Freshwater fish of India", "Fish of Laos", "Freshwater fish of Indonesia", "Fish of Southeast Asia", "Freshwater fish of China", "Fish of Vietnam"], "title": "Akysis"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7724668", "text": "Sikandar Bagh\n\nSikandar Bagh (, ), formerly known by the British as Sikunder/Sikandra/Secundra Bagh, is a villa and garden enclosed by a fortified wall, with loopholes, gateway and corner bastions, approx. 150 yards square, c. , located in the city of Lucknow, Oudh, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was built by the last Nawab of Oudh, Wajid Ali Shah (1822–1887), as a summer residence. The name of the villa signifies '\"Garden of Sikandar\", perhaps after Alexander the Great, whose name lives on in this form in these parts (compare Alexandria, Egypt, in Arabic الإسكندرية\n\"Al-Iskandariya\"), or perhaps after Sikandar Mahal Begum, the Nawab's favourite wife. It was stormed in 1857 by the British during the Indian Rebellion and witnessed within its walls the slaughter of all 2,200 sepoy mutineers who had made it a stronghold during their Siege of Lucknow. The site now houses the National Botanical Research Institute of India.\n\nThe garden was laid out in about 1800 as a royal garden by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. It was later improved upon by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the last native ruler of Oudh, during the first half of the 19th century, who used it as his summer villa. The garden has a small pavilion in the middle, which was likely the scene of innumerable performances of the Ras-lilas, and Kathak dances, music and poetic 'mehfils' and other cultural activities which the last Nawab had a great appreciation for, indeed possibly too great a one as history has judged him to have been over-fond of his leisure interests.\n\nDuring the Indian Rebellion, the Sikander Bagh was used as one of many strongholds of sepoy mutineers during their siege of the British Residency in Lucknow. It stood in the way of the Commander-in-Chief Sir Colin Campbell's planned route to relieve the besieged Residency. \n\nOn the morning of 16 November 1857, whilst passing by its eastern side in a southerly direction, in a sunken lane, the British force was surprised and stopped in its tracks by overwhelmingly heavy fire coming from the Sikander Bagh. A staff officer remarked to a comrade \"If these fellows allow one of us to get out of this cul-de-sac alive, they deserve every one of them to be hanged\". The cavalry were jammed together, unable to advance, and the high banks on either side seemed to offer an impassable barrier to artillery. However Blunt of the Bengal Horse Artillery led his troop and \"conquering the impossible\", brought them with their guns into an open space to the east of the Sikandar Bagh, galloping through enemy fire. Here he unlimbered with remarkable coolness and self-possession. The six guns opened fire on the Sikandar Bagh. Sappers and miners demolished part of the earth banks which allowing two 18-pounder heavy guns of Travers's battery of the Artillery Brigade to be brought up out of the lane. After half an hour of bombardment from a range of only , an aperture was created in the south-east angle of the wall in a bricked-up doorway, \"an ugly blind hole\", about square and off the ground. Although only large enough to admit a single man with difficulty it was immediately rushed under heavy fire by some of the 93rd Highlanders and some men of the 4th Punjab Infantry (4th P.I.) under Lieutenant McQueen, 14 managing to enter the Sikaddar Bagh. \n\nAt the same time the rest of the 4th P.I. under Lieutenant Paul assaulted the gateway. The gate was in the process of being closed by the mutineers, when Subadar Mukarab Khan, 4th P.I., a Pathan of Bajaur, one of the leading men of the attack, thrust his left arm and shield between its folds, thus preventing it being shut and barred. Though his left arm was wounded, he still managed to keep his shield between the folds by holding it with his right hand until the door was forced. This took place whilst Lt. McQueen's party and some of the Highlanders, who had entered by the breach, came from the rear of the many defenders of the gateway. After a long hand-to-hand struggle the British forced their way in greater numbers into the Sikandar Bagh through the gate, and through the breach which had been enlarged by the sappers. Slowly forced back, the main body of about 2,000 mutineers took refuge in a large 2-storied building and the high-walled enclosure behind it. The 2 doors to the enclosure were assaulted by the 4th P.I. Lt. McQueen led the assault against the right gate, and Lt. Willoughby tackled the left. The defenders had expected an attack from the opposite quarter and had bricked up the door to their rear and in doing so blocked their retreat. After a long struggle they were all slain, no quarter being given. With cries such as \"Cawnpore! You bloody murderers\", it was clear that the British attackers blamed these mutineers for the slaughter of European civilians earlier in the Mutiny, including women and children, particularly during the Siege of Cawnpore, which caused outrage throughout British India and in Britain. Lord Roberts who witnessed the assault later recalled: \"'Inch by inch they were forced back to the pavilion, and into the space between it and the north wall, where they were all shot or bayoneted. There they lay in a heap as high as my head, a heaving, surging mass of dead and dying inextricably entangled. It was a sickening site, one of those which even in the excitement of battle and the flush of victory, make one feel strongly what a horrible side there is to war. The wounded men could not get clear of their dead comrades, however great their struggles, and those near the top of this ghastly pile vented their rage and determination on every British officer who approached, by showering upon him abuse of the foulest description\".\n\nThose killed or wounded during the assault included 9 officers and 90 men of the 93rd Highlanders, and 3 officers and 69 men from the 4th Punjabi Infantry.\n\nKey: (1) Position of 18-pounder guns; (2) Breach made in wall; (3) Gateway; (4) Bastion stormed from inside by 4th. Punjab Infantry Regt., cutting off enemy's retreat; (5) Centre pavilion with verandah; (6) One-storied building overlooking whole garden with own courtyard behind; (7) East bastion, exploded, killing Lt. Paul, in command of 4th P.I.; (8) Spot occupied by Sir Colin Campbell, C-in-C, and Staff from 18 to 22 November.\n\nAfter the fighting, the British and loyal native Punjab Infantry dead were buried in a deep trench. Later elephants were used to drag the corpses of the mutineers out of the Sikandar Bagh, where they were slightly covered over in a ditch which they themselves had recently dug outside the north wall in order to strengthen the defences.\n\nThe 4th Punjab Infantry remained quartered in the Sikandar Bagh until Lucknow was evacuated by the British 11 days later on 27 November, while the Commander-in-Chief and his staff occupied a site to the west of the gate, under the south wall, from 18 to 22 November. \n\nIn early 1858 Felice Beato photographed the Sikandar Bagh, showing skeletal remains strewn across the grounds of the interior. These were apparently disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact.\n\nIt is said that more Victoria Crosses were awarded for that single day than ever, many for the assault on the Sikandar Bagh. \nThe recipients were as follows:\n\n\nSgt Samuel Hill and Major John Guise - for going to the aid of wounded, elected by the regiment\n\n\n\n\n\nArticles such as cannonball, swords and shields, parts of muskets and rifles, dug out of the garden over the years are now displayed in the NBRI Exhibition and scars from cannonball on the old walls of the garden still bear witness to the event.\n\nAnother visible reminder of the battle is the statue, erected some years ago in the old campus of the garden, of Uda Devi, a Pasi (a Dalit community) lady, who fought side by side with the besieged mutineers. Attired in male battle dress, she had perched herself atop a tree in the garden, gun in hand, and kept the British attackers at bay until her ammunition was exhausted, upon which she dropped dead to the ground, her body riddled with bullets.As far as the legend goes Uda Devi was one of the female bodyguards of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah.She was fiercely dedicated to her master. Trained in martial Arts and espionage she also learned the art of guerrilla warfare and fought with her gun till the last bullet. The British were also surprised and stunned by her marksmanship until she was spotted by the soldiers, who fired relentlessly at her till she died from her wounds.\n\n\n\"Indian Mutiny\" by Saul David 2002 \n\"My Indian Mutiny Diary\" by WH Russell 1967 \n\n", "id": "7724668", "categories": ["Houses completed in the 19th century", "Ruins in India", "Monuments and memorials in Uttar Pradesh", "Gardens in India", "Battles of the Indian Rebellion of 1857", "History of Lucknow", "1857 in India", "Gardens in Uttar Pradesh", "Tourist attractions in Lucknow"], "title": "Sikandar Bagh"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7724703", "text": "Giulio Cesare Polerio\n\nGiulio Cesare Polerio (c. 1550, Lanciano – c. 1610, Rome; reconstruction of places and dates by Adriano Chicco) was an Italian chess theoretician and player.\n\nName affixes used for him are \"l'Apruzzese\", Giu[o]lio Cesare \"da Lanciano\" (Salvio/Walker), and \"Lancianese\", because he was born in Lanciano, a town in the Chieti province of the Abruzzo region of Italy.\n\nThe first printed matter in which the name Giulio Cesare da Lanciano occurs is the so-called \"Il Puttino\" of Alessandro Salvio first published in 1634. The story recounted in Il Puttino must have occurred around 1575, thus, published by Salvio some 60 years later. \"Il Puttino, altramente detto il Cavaliere errante\" is a nickname used by Alessandro Salvio for Giovanni Leonardo. According to Alessandro Salvio, Giulio Cesare da Lanciano accompanied Giovanni Leonardo on his way to Madrid until Genoa.\n\nAfter returning to Rome around 1584, Polerio became a chess player and writer in ordinary of Giacomo Boncompagni, Duke of Sora and son of Pope Gregory XIII (born Ugo Boncompagni).\n\nPolerio wrote a number of codexes in which a lively international chess is described (exchanges of ideas among Italy, Portugal, and Spain). In these codexes, besides of own and new ideas in chess openings, some matches played by himself are noted by the hand of Polerio.\n\nIn the Puttino, Salvio mentions that, starting in 1606 from \"\"Città di Piazza\"\", after a long travel on his way to Rome (p. 43) ... (p. 44: \"\"il detto Signor Cascio poi andando a Roma, vinse Giulio Cesare compagno del Puttino il primo a Roma, in casa dell'Eccelenza del Sig. Giacobo Buoncompagno Duca di Sora\"\") this Mr. Geronimo Cascio, on his way to Rome, beat Giulio Cesare (Polerio), companion of Il Puttino, the best in Rome, in the house/court of his Excellence Giacomo Boncompagni, Duke of Sora.\n\nThe first systematic investigation of the Codexes of Polerio was published by Antonius van der Linde in 1874. The subject of the investigations by Van der Linde can be found at the Bibliotheca Van der Linde-Niemeijeriana, part of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands.\n\nThe current systematics of the Codexes of Polerio has been performed and published by Alessandro Sanvito in 2005.\n\nThe systematic organisation of overall seven Codexes, described and called A-G by Van der Linde, and attributed to Polerio in 1874, had major impact on the further description of chess history, and history of chess theory. A relevant part of the work of Van der Linde was to compare Codexes of Polerio and Gioacchino Greco even superfine. According to this investigation, most of the analytic work of Polerio was mediated outside of Italy, up to 1874, via Gioacchino Greco. The clue, which potentially could link both chess players, may be seen in the person Giacomo Boncompagni, or the Duchy of Sora respectively.\n\nOn p. 186 of \"Das Schachspiel des XVI. Jahrhunderts\" van der Linde wrote in 1874:\n\n\"D. Polerio-Gambit\n\n224\n\n1. e2-e4 e7-e5\n2. f2-f4 e5-f4:\n3. Sg1-f3 g7-g5\n4. Lf1-c4 g5-g4\n5. 0-0! g4-f3:\n6. Dd1-f3: \"e cosi ancor che habbia perso un pezzo resta con buonissima postura di poter uencere il gioco sapendo guidarlo à presso, il che sarebbe superfluo inogni modo se si uolesse mostrare la fine di tutti giochi, e per questo basta insino à un certo che, tanto che si conosca apartemente il uantagio del gioco, si come per la postura di dette giochi ogni giudicioso giocatore lo potrà facilmente cognoscere\".\")\n\n... in modern terms:\n\n\"Polerio Gambit: 1. e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0! gxf3 6.Qxf3 +/−\"\n\nExactly this move order was also found later even in a second Polerio Codex discovered and described by J.A. Leon in 1894.\nOf note is that the position after 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3 may be considered by most recent grandmasters as a forced win for White – provided that 5.0-0 would mean \"free castling\", i.e. bringing the White King from e1 to h1. Actually, Polerio did claim 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3 to be favourable for White although the white king of Polerio did stand, after 5.0-0, on h1 but not on g1 (i.e. castling as defined in our days).\n\nHowever, in 1874, the move order 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0! was already occupied by the term \"Muzio Gambit\". This term derives from a translation of a work of Alessandro Salvio, supposedly the third book of the reprint of 1723, by Sarrat in 1813. On page 209 Jacob Henry Sarratt (translated) and wrote:\n\n\"SALVIO states that the following Gambit was sent to him by Signor Muzio, ...\"\n\nActually, Alessandro Salvio never stated this. Rather, in the third book of the Il Puttino he wrote that Signor Mutio d'Alessandro did see that Geronimo Cascio did play the move order (with free castling, also called \"Italian method\" of castling).\n\nWith p. 165, vol. 2, of the 1821 edition of A New Treatise of the Game of Chess the term Muzio Gambit was coined by Jacob Henry Sarratt. And with the latter work of Sarrat, in 1821 the modern theory of the \"Muzio Gambit\" with castling according modern rules started – an idea and a position already Polerio analysed in 1579/80.\n\nThus, Antonius van der Linde, changed the view on the historical development of the move order 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 in 1874, most notably in the last editions of the Handbuch. Thereafter, a trend can be seen to call this move order either with hyphenated terms such as Muzio–Polerio, Polerio–Muzio, or simply Polerio Gambit. Such a terminology is both in honour of Giulio Cesare Polerio and partially misleading since the major body of the theory of this opening was generated in the time span in-between 1821 and 1874. The number of games played by Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy, and Wilhelm Steinitz with 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 or 5.d4 in the time span 1821–1874 was already rather high. The rules for Chess opening nomenclature, and their historical development, should be taken into account while assessing van der Linde's claim of 1874 \"D. Polerio-Gambit\".\n\nIn 1874, Van der Linde suggested as well (p. 188) to rename the move order 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 Bg7 5.h4 h6 6.d4 d6 7.Nc3 c6 8.hxg5 hxg5 9.Rxh8 Bxh8 10.Ne5!? into \"Polerio's second Gambit\". This suggestion is based on the observation that \"im Handbuch (1864, S.. 366, § 3)\" this move order is called \"das Gambit des Calabresen\". This is a rather interesting observation since in the \"Handbuch\" in its 2nd edition as of 1852, on p. 205 it is mentioned that the move order 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 f5 can be found \"at the Calabrese\". That's a rather wise wording since both 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 f5 and 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5, according to Codexes of Polerio, occurred in games of \"Gio. Leonardo\" (games 236–238, p. 190 in van der Linde). Both Giovanni Leonardo and Gioacchino Greco derived from Calabria, the first from Cutro, the second from Celico(?).\n\n", "id": "7724703", "categories": ["Chess theoreticians", "1550s births", "Italian chess players", "1610s deaths", "16th century in chess"], "title": "Giulio Cesare Polerio"}

The erstwhile left front led West Bengal state government holds the Indian record for the longest period of governance.\n\nUntil 3 November 2000, Jyoti Basu was the Chief Minister of the state. After his resignation, due to health reasons, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee became the Chief Minister of West Bengal who continued in office until 13 May 2011.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2011 elections, the state witnessed several violent clashes between the workers of the opposition parties and the ruling left party cadres.\n\nIn the 2011 Assembly Election, the Trinamool Congress- Indian National Congress alliance won by a huge margin with Mamata Banerjee becoming the first woman chief minister of West Bengal after 34 years of Communist rule.\n\nIn the 2016 Election, Congress and Left Front formed an alliance, and the election witnessed a three-way contest between their alliance, Trinamool Congress, and BJP.\n\nWest Bengal is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor is the head of state appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 295 Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs, including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. Terms of office run for five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as \"panchayats\", for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes 42 seats to the Lok Sabha and 16 seats to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament. \nThe area's early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas (kingdoms), while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. The region was part of several ancient pan-Indian empires, including the Mauryans and Guptas. It was also a bastion of regional kingdoms. The citadel of Gauda served as the capital of the Gauda Kingdom, the Buddhist Pala Empire (eighth to 11th century) and Hindu Sena Empire (11th–12th century). From the 13thcentury onward, the region was ruled by several sultans, powerful Hindu states, and Baro-Bhuyan landlords, until the beginning of British rule in the 18thcentury. The British East India Company cemented their hold on the region following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, and Calcutta served for many years as the capital of British India. The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in an expansion of Western education, culminating in developments in science, institutional education, and social reforms in the region, including what became known as the Bengali Renaissance. A hotbed of the Indian independence movement through the early 20thcentury, Bengal was divided during India's independence in 1947 along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal, a state of India, and East Bengal, a province of Pakistan which later became independent Bangladesh.\n\nIn 1950, the Princely State of Koch Bihar merged with West Bengal after King Jagaddipendra Narayan had signed the Instrument of Accession with India. In 1955, the former French enclave of Chandannagar, which had passed into Indian control after 1950, was integrated into West Bengal. Portions of Bihar were subsequently merged with West Bengal.\n\nDuring Roy's Chief Minister-ship very few manufacturing industries were set up in the state. In 1954, when Dr. B. C. Roy was the Congress chief minister, a massive food crisis overtook the state. There was a near-famine condition in Bengal.\n\nAfter the state legislative elections held in 1967, the CPI(M) was the main force behind the United Front government formed. The Chief Ministership was given to Ajoy Mukherjee of the Bangla Congress.\n\nIn 1967 a peasant uprising broke out in Naxalbari, in northern West Bengal. The insurgency was led by hardline district-level CPI(M) leaders Charu Majumdar and Kanu Sanyal. The Naxalbari movement was violently repressed by the West Bengal government. During the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Marxist-Naxalite movement damaged much of the state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation.\n\nThe Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in the influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure. The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress. The Left Front, led by Communist Party of India (Marxist), has governed for the state for the subsequent three decades.\n\nIn November 1967, the West Bengal United Front government was dismissed by the central government. Initially the Indian National Congress formed a minority government led by Prafulla Chandra Ghosh, but that cabinet did not last long. Following the proclamation that the United Front government had been dislodged, a 48-hour hartal was effective throughout the state. After the fall of the Ghosh cabinet, the state was put under President's Rule.\n\nFresh elections were held in West Bengal in 1969. CPI(M) emerged as the largest party in the West Bengal legislative assembly. But with the active support of CPI and the Bangla Congress, Ajoy Mukherjee was returned as Chief Minister of the state. Mukherjee resigned on March 16, 1970 and the state was put under President's Rule.\n\nIndian National Congress the 1972 assembly election, and its leader Siddhartha Shankar Ray became the chief minister. During this period, the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi proclaimed nationwide Emergency in 1975.\n\nThis period was marked by large scale violence as the police force battled with the naxalites and ultimately crushed the movement in the state.\n\nIn the 1977 election of the state legislature, the Left Front, headed by Communist Party of India (Marxist), won 243 seats thereby gaining a majority. The first Left Front government was established with Jyoti Basu as the Chief Minister.\n\nThe massacre in Marichjhanpi, which took place under CPI(M) rule in Bengal between January 26 and May 16, 1979, relates to the forcible eviction of refugees who had fled from East Pakistan thereby leading to the death of a sizable population among them.\n\nAfter leading the Left Front government for consecutive five terms, Jyoti Basu retired from active politics and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was appointed as his successor. Five years later, the Left Front came back to the power with Bhattacharjee again assuming the office of the Chief Minister.\n\nThe state's economic recovery gathered momentum after economic reforms in India were introduced in the early 1990s by the central government, aided by election of a new reformist Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya in 2000. As of 2007, armed activists have been organizing terrorist attacks in some parts of the state, while clashes with the administration have taken place at several sensitive places on the issue of industrial land acquisition.\n\nThe Nandigram violence was an incident in Nandigram, West Bengal where, on the orders of the Left Front government, more than 4,000 heavily armed police stormed the Nandigram area with the aim of stamping out protests against the West Bengal government’s plans to expropriate of land for a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to be developed by the Indonesian-based Salim Group. The police shot dead at least 14 villagers and wounded 70 more.\n\nThe SEZ controversy started when the government of West Bengal decided that the Salim Group of Indonesia would set up a chemical hub under the SEZ policy at Nandigram, a rural area in the district of Purba Medinipur. The villagers took over the administration of the area and all the roads to the villages were cut off. A front-page story in the Kolkata newspaper, \"The Telegraph\", on 4 January 2007 was headlined, \"False alarm sparks clash\". According to the newspaper that village council meeting at which the alleged land seizure was to be announced was actually a meeting to declare Nandigram a \"clean village\", that is, a village in which all the households had access to toilet facilities.\n\nIn the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, Left Front was defeated and Trinamool Congress won an absolute majority of seats. Mamata Banerjee, the leader of Trinamool Congress, became the chief minister. The success of Trinamool Congress was repeated in the 2013 Panchayat election (local government elections in rural areas, and some urban municipalities) and the India national general election, 2014 (in which Trinamool won 34 of 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state).\nMajor political parties of West Bengal\n\n \n", "id": "7724802", "categories": ["Politics of West Bengal"], "title": "Politics of West Bengal"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7724815", "text": "Bluestar (bus company)\n\nSolent Blue Line Ltd, which trades primarily under the name Bluestar, is a bus operator providing services in south Hampshire. It is a subsidiary of the Go South Coast sector of the Go-Ahead Group.\n\nSolent Blue Line was formed by Southern Vectis in May 1987 to compete with Southampton Citybus on some of its major routes with some Bristol VRTs.\n\nIn October 1987 Solent Blue Line purchased the Hants & Sussex business from Basil Williams and the Eastleigh and Southampton routes which had previously been part of Hants & Dorset, from Stagecoach in Hampshire. This expanded the fleet from 16 to 115 buses. New buses began to be purchased with Leyland Olympians for the Southampton to Winchester service and minibuses for the Eastleigh to Winchester service. Some services were operated under franchise by Brijan Tours and Marchwood Motorways.\n\nFrom here the network expanded until in 2003 the network underwent a change, involving a new name and the launch of the Bluestar brand soon after, as a name for their premier services with Bluestar services one and two launching in 2004, the three and four service launching a year later and the Waterside services eight and nine having fully launched by 2006.\n\nIn July 2005 Solent Blue Line was included in the sale of Southern Vectis to the Go-Ahead Group and subsequently the head office functions of the company were consolidated with those of the other Go South Coast companies, Southern Vectis and Wilts & Dorset, in Poole. In October 2006 Solent Blue Line purchased Marchwood Motorways\n\nAfter the withdrawal of the Red Rocket brand on 25 February 2008, most of the company's services began to run under the Bluestar brand. The fleet has recently undergone several updates, including the introduction of a smartcard system called the key, the introduction of free Wi-Fi internet to all buses, and USB charging points.\n\nAs of 22 June 2017, all Bluestar and Unilink buses accept contactless payment, as part of a £1.6m investment from Hampshire County Council.\n\nThe company itself holds the original name of Solent Blue Line, however none of the buses it operates use this branding, the last few buses using this branding was incorporated into the Bluestar network in 2008. As a result, a number of sub brands are used for the bus services.\n\nBluestar was originally launched in 2004 running the main routes with destinations outside of Southampton. However, since 2008 the service has become the main brand for the company. The vast majority of these services terminate in Southampton, with the exception of services 7 (Sholing - Woolston - City Centre - Shirley - Millbrook - General Hospital - Lordshill) and 18 (Thornhill - Bitterne - Northam - City Centre - Shirley - Millbrook) which go through the city, and service 5 (Boyatt Wood - Eastleigh - North Baddesley - Romsey) thus not going near the city centre. In addition to these services, Services 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16 and 17 also operate under the Bluestar brand.\n\nThe Nightstar services used to run on Friday and Saturday nights and were aimed at people who had a night out in Southampton. All services began at Leisure World, Southampton and made their way past other large clubs before completing its route. These routes generally followed those of their daytime number counterparts with additional stops to take into account destinations served by other routes. In January 2013, all but the Unilink U1N ceased to run due to council funding cuts.\n\nThe QuayConnect shuttle service runs a service around the city of Southampton, stopping at Southampton Central railway station, Westquay Shopping Centre and Town Quay, for the Hythe Ferry and the Red Funnel ferries to the Isle of Wight. The service was started as City-Link, under the previous operator, Enterprise, but the operation was taken over by Bluestar on 28 September 2008, and rebranded as QuayConnect in May 2016, with new livery of red and white, featuring the newest Red Jet which came into service for Red Funnel shortly after. Originally, the two buses used on the service were inherited from Enterprise, and were repainted in a new two-tone blue livery with the interiors rebranded. Originally the service was free to use for all passengers, but a change in May 2014 saw a £1 single fare introduced to all passengers except Red Funnel ticket holders, who remain entitled to free travel. The frequency of the service was also cut down to every 30 minutes, but with a duplicate bus running on some morning services and a 15-minute frequency between 4-7pm, or when local events take place in Southampton or the Isle of Wight, such as Cowes Week or Bestival.\n\nThe Unilink service is run under contract by Bluestar, on behalf of the University of Southampton.\n\nThe contract was extended for a further ten years in December 2017 and the company ordered 32 new buses for the Unilink fleet.\n\nThe New Forest Tour is a circular open-top bus service running around the New Forest, between Lyndhurst, Brockenhurst, Lymington, Beaulieu and Exbury.\n\nIt commenced in 2004, using distinctively branded yellow and orange Bristol VRs (in the same livery as the old Southern Vectis open-top services). The service was reversed in 2005, to run in the opposite direction. For the 2006 season, two low-floor East Lancs Myllennium bodied Volvo B7TLs from Wilts & Dorset were used, retaining the Wilts & Dorset livery but with \"New Forest Tour\" vinyls added. In 2007 the buses passed to Solent Blue Line and were repainted in a new green and orange livery, with ponies on the side. Again, this is similar to the Southern Vectis livery which that company uses on their open-top buses.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010, Bluestar used Baby Bluestar branding for their local services. There have been twelve Baby Bluestar services, of which the H1, H2, H3, P1, T1 and T2 all still run, albeit under the Bluestar name. Five of the other services have since been dropped and reverted to the normal Bluestar services.\n\nRed Rocket was launched on 3 September 2006 as a high frequency network centred on Eastleigh, extending to Winchester in the north and Hamble-le-Rice in the south. Red Rocket services were either withdrawn or re-branded to Baby Bluestar on 24 February 2008, to enable Solent Blue Line to trade under the Bluestar name.\n\nThere were originally eight Red Rocket routes, lettered to avoid confusion with the Bluestar and Solent Blue Line service in operation at the time.\n\nThe Solent Shuttle was an express bus link that ran between Portsmouth and Southampton. The service itself was established in 1976 as a joint venture between Hants & Dorset and Southdown Motor Services, between passing on to other operators including Southampton City Bus, First Hampshire & Dorset and Tellings-Golden Miller; First branded the services as the 727 and the 747 while Tellings-Golden Miller branded it the Solent Clipper, under the service names the X27 and the X47.\n\nSolent Blue Line took over the service, but ran into difficulties following the cessation of funding from Portsmouth and Southampton City Councils. The service was due to close on 2 June 2007, but by popular demand and with the support of pensioners associations in both cities, the service continued on a two-hourly basis. However, the service was ceased two years later on 21 February 2009.\n\nThe Beep! Bus service operated between Eastleigh, Boyatt Wood, Velmore and Southampton between 8 October 2008 and February 2009. The service operated in direct competition with the rival Velvet B service operating on the same route and timetabled three minutes behind those of the Beep bus. Initially the service was registered with VOSA as a Wilts & Dorset route to begin on 15 September 2008, but this was later cancelled and replaced with an identical Bluestar registration. The service began a full week before its registration date to match the start date of Velvet's service, but was unable to take fares and so operated as a free service until their start date a week later. Normal fares were slightly lower than Velvet's on some journeys but local journeys were more expensive. Bluestar operations director Andrew Wickham said that the decision was \"a business decision pure and simple\", adding that they \"are not scared of competition\" but Velvet were \"deliberately creaming off\" some of their passengers. The rival Velvet service ended on 10 January 2009 because of low passenger numbers. Soon after, Bluestar announced their intention to withdraw Beep! Bus from February 2009, ironically one year after they withdrew the Red Rocket B service.\n\nThe 'Do the Docks' tour was an open-top bus tour of Southampton docks, using open-top buses from the New Forest Tour and a debranded Wilts & Dorset Leyland Olympian. The service changed on 29 July 2007 as a result of low passenger numbers following poor weather during the 2007 summer season, with the service losing its \"turn up and hop on\" format and becoming a chartered service. The route saw a brief reprieve in April 2008, when the service ran for two days on 26 and 27 of that month, as part of the Caribbean festival in Southampton. As Solent Blue Line no longer had the open-top buses for the routes, a hired Southern Vectis open-top bus was used.\n\nIn March 2007 whilst being used as a rail-replacement bus a double-decker member of the Red Rocket fleet drove under a low bridge at Barnham causing the top to be ripped off, in addition to minor damage to the bridge. It is now with Southern Vectis as an open-topper. A similar incident occurred at Romsey in May 2015, when a double-decker bus had its roof removed after colliding with a railway bridge\n\nIn July 2009, the MP for Eastleigh Chris Huhne asked for an investigation into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour of Bluestar against Velvet's over their implementation and subsequent removal of extra services, which operated between Eastleigh and Fair Oak, to rival Velvet's service, the Fair Oak Flyer.\n\nIn the early hours of 22 March 2011, there was an incident between a car and a Bluestar bus on route 2 between Southampton, Eastleigh and Fair Oak, resulting in a single fatality of the car driver, and the passenger last known to be in a critical condition. Only one passenger of the 10 on-board were treated for minor injuries.\n\nAt around 16:30 on 7 February 2012, a Marchwood Motorways Mercedes-Benz Citaro caught fire on Calmore Roundabout, Totton. The bus was being driven Not In Service by a mechanic at the time - there were no injuries but the bus was destroyed.\n\n\n", "id": "7724815", "categories": ["Companies based in Hampshire", "Coach operators in England", "Go South Coast companies", "Bus operators in Hampshire"], "title": "Bluestar (bus company)"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7724855", "text": "Elene\n\nElene is a poem in Old English, that is sometimes known as Saint Helena Finds the True Cross. It was translated from a Latin text and is the longest of Cynewulf's four signed poems. It is the fifth of six poems appearing in the Vercelli manuscript, which also contains \"The Fates of the Apostles\", \"Andreas\", \"Soul and Body I\", the \"Homiletic Fragment I\" and \"Dream of the Rood\". The poem is the first English account of the finding of the Holy Cross by Saint Helena, the mother of Emperor Constantine. The poem was written by Cynewulf some time between 750 and the tenth century. It is written in a West Saxon dialect, but certain Anglianisms and metrical evidence concerning false rhymes suggest it was written in an Anglian rather than Saxon dialect. It is 1,321 lines long.\n\nCynewulf's signature, which is always in runes, appears on \"Christ II\", \"Juliana\", \"The Fates of the Apostles\" and \"Elene\". The dialect in his poems suggests that he was either Mercian or Northumbrian. He was probably most active around the late 8th and early 9th centuries, though there is other research to support that he was active between the late 9th and late 10th centuries.\n\nCynewulf's true identity is still unknown, but there have been efforts to narrow down the list of possible poets. The four most favored candidates are Cynewulf, who was the bishop of Lindisfarne in Northumbria in around 783; Cynulf, a priest (ca. 803); Cynewulf, the father of Bishop Cyuneweard of Wells, who died in 975; and Cenwulf, an abbot of Peterborough Abbey in around 1006). There is not enough evidence to support any of these claims.\n\n\"Elene\" is contained in the \"Vercelli Book\", appearing on fol. 121a-133b.\n\nThe story is loosely based on historical events and takes place within an anachronistic setting that amalgamates wars of the fourth-century involving the Romans, the Huns and the Franks. \"Elene\" fits into a subgenre of \"inventio\", the search for sacrosanct relics of the saints. Cynewulf's source for the legend of St. Helena's Finding of the Cross was probably the \"Acta Cyriaci\" and a version of it is written in the \"Acta Sanctorum\" for May 4.\n\nThe poem begins with Constantine, emperor of Rome, riding out to battle the Huns and Hrethgoths. He is a mighty king made strong by God, though he is not aware of the Christian God yet. He sees a vision in the sky and he is told that he will halt his enemies with the symbol that is shown to him by the heavens. The battle begins and Constantine reveals the symbol that he was shown, a cross. The cross sends his enemies running in all directions and they are easily defeated by the Romans.\n\nConstantine returns home and addresses an assembly on whether they know the meaning of the symbol that saved his people. Only the wisest know that the cross is the symbol of the Lord in Heaven, Jesus Christ. Constantine is baptized and becomes a devout Christian, due to his experience. He learns from the Bible how and where Christ was killed, so he orders Helen, his mother, to lead an army to the land of the Jews to find where the true cross is buried. She leads an army of men onto a ship and begins the journey to Israel.\n\nOnce in the city of Jerusalem, she calls an assembly of sage Jews and scorns them for having condemned Jesus to death, leaving them wondering what they have done to anger the queen. Judas tells his fellow Jews that he knows the queen searches for the cross. Judas was brought up on Christian teachings, and his brother Stephen was stoned to death for being a Christian. The Jews refuse to help Helen find the cross, so she threatens them with death. Frightened, they hand over Judas. He also refuses to tell her where it is, so she locks him in a dark prison for seven days without food. On the seventh day he cries out that he cannot take the torture any longer and will reveal where the cross is. He leads the queen to the hill where Jesus was crucified.\n\nJudas converts to Christianity in a passionate speech to God acknowledging Jesus as his Savior. God gives Judas a smoke sign in the sky, which convinces him of his new-found belief. He digs and finds three crosses. A crowd forms, but no one knows which of the three was the cross of Christ. They set the crosses up in the city hoping that Christ would show them the truth. A corpse is brought forth, and each cross is held over him. The third cross brings him back to life.\n\nSatan appears in grotesque form angry that he has had a soul stolen from him. Judas cleverly argues with Satan with his new faith, but Satan leaves with a threat that he will raise up a king to retaliate. Helen sends word home to Constantine, who tells her to build a church on the hillside where the crosses were found. She encases the true cross in gold and jewels and places it in the church. Judas is baptized and puts away his false religion. He is appointed to priesthood and is renamed Cyriacus because of his rebirth.\n\nHelen then decides she needs to find the nails that held Christ up on the cross. Cyriacus searches for them, and God again gives him a sign in the form of fire to show where they are buried. Helen receives the gift with tears of joy, and the Holy Spirit fills her with the gift of wisdom and forever protects the saint. She goes to a wise man to find out how she should use the nails, and he advises her to use them in the bit of Constantine's horse so that he would always be victorious in battle. The epilogue of the poem is devoted to the personal reflection of Cynewulf and his interpretation of Doomsday. Cynewulf tells of how he has experienced a spiritual metamorphosis. His depiction of the Last Judgement resembles a sort of Purgatory where people are divided into three groups, two of which undergo cleansing to reach salvation, while the third is damned to eternal Hell.\n\nHelen is not the typical passive Old English heroine. She is strong and autonomous, more like the women in Old Norse literature rather than the Graeco-Roman saints. Old Norse heroines are strong, assertive, and persuade physically instead of verbally. Cynewulf purposely wanted his audience to view Helen as a strong individual. He does not include her death in the poem as the Latin version does and he does not have her submitting to Constantine and Cyriacus as she does in the Latin version. In fact it is the opposite. We see Cyriacus completely submitting himself to Helen: \"hæfde Ciriacus / eall gefylled swa him seo æðele bebead, / wifes willan\" (line 1129b), \"('Cyriacus had completely done as the noble woman bade him to do, the will of the woman')\".\n\nHelen can be understood as an allegory of the Christian Church and its mission to lead men to salvation through acceptance of the Cross. Literally, her mission is to find the true cross, but allegorically, her mission is to evangelize the Jews. Helen is referred to as a warrior queen and she has an army of warriors, but they never fight. The warriors are there to subjugate a powerful enemy, which could be Satan or non-believers. Judas and Helen are an allegory for the relationship of the Church with its members. Judas's dialogue reveals him to be of the human condition; he has the capacity for saintliness and wickedness.\n\nAnti-Semitism is a topic of discussion for scholars regarding the poem: Elene's oppressive tactics towards the Jewish elders are rewarded in the end. A Marxist argument can also be made when looking at how Judas eventually submits to his oppressor. He arises from the pit as a heroic-type figure and it seems the reins of authority Elene exercises only do good in the end. It is contended that this justifies the authority of royalty in Cynewulf's time.\n\nIn terms of symbolism, the good-bad dichotomy, which is prevalent in Old English verse, finds itself in the oppositions of light and dark imagery in the poem. For instance, it is observed in the poem that Judas spends seven nights in a pit, and the 'darkness' can be seen to convey his obstinacy in refusing to see the 'light' of Christianity.\n\nAlong with alliteration, which is a key part to all Old English poetry, there are also places in the poem where Cynewulf applies rhyme in order to emphasize certain words, such as in the battle scene (50-55a):\n<poem>\n\"Ridon ymb rofne, ðonne rand dynede,\n</poem>\n\"('They rode about the famous one; then the shield dinned, the battle-tarp clanged, the king advanced with a troop, a battalion to the battle. The raven yelled from above, dark and greedy for carrion. The troop was on the march. The horn-bearers ran, the heralds called out, the horse trod the earth\"), In this example, the rhymes emphasize the din of voices and the crash of weapons, which builds excitement throughout the battle scene.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7724855", "categories": ["God in fiction", "Old English poems"], "title": "Elene"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7724893", "text": "Aleksei Gastev\n\nAleksei Kapitonovich Gastev () (1882–1939) was a participant in the Russian Revolution of 1905, a pioneer of scientific management in Russia, a trade-union activist and an avant garde poet.\n\nBorn to a family of a teacher and a seamstress in Suzdal, Russia, Aleksei Gastev enrolled into the Moscow Pedagogical Institute, but was expelled as a result of his participation in a revolutionary meeting. He joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1901. An active participant in the Russian Revolution of 1905, Gastev was the leader of a fighting squad in Kostroma and agitated workers to strike in the Northern Russian cities of Yaroslavl, Ivanovo-Voznesensk and Rostov. During this time, Gastev was closely associated with the Bolshevik faction of the Party. He frequently corresponded with Lenin and Krupskaya on matters of party policy in 1903-1904 and reported to Lenin on the general strike in Ivanovo-Voznesensk in 1905.\n\nAs a result of his revolutionary activism, Gastev was arrested by the authorities and exiled to various parts of Northern and Eastern Russia in at least three separate incidents. He was nevertheless able to escape from his exiles each time, living illegally in Russia and usually managing to find his way abroad. In 1907 Gastev dissociated himself from the activities of the Bolshevik faction.\n\nFrom 1901 until 1917 Gastev divided his time between exiles, escapes and work in Russian or European factories. His experience as a factory worker led him to develop a rather practical approach to Marxism. Revolution for Gastev meant empowering workers by allowing them to control everyday matters related to work-processes. Gastev became involved in the work of the Petersburg Union of Metal Workers, one of the most influential trade-unions in Russia, in 1907.\nIn 1908 he got work with the Vasileostovskii Trolley Depot. Here he was chosen to monitor wear and tear on the transmission belts and sprockets and analyse the repair process of the trolley cars. It was here that he first thought of developoing a \"science for the social construction of enterprises\".\n\nIn 1910 he was again arrested but when he was sent to Siberia, he escaped to Paris, where he worked for the motor-car manufacturer Clément-Bayard. Here he first became familiar with quality assurance which was carried out in a particularly thorough fashion. By 1912 he was working for Citroën where he witnessed the application of assembly line production which André Citroën was introducing following a visit to the Ford plant in the United States. At that time, he became familiar with French Syndicalism and adopted many of the views of that movement, seeing trade unions as a chief means of confronting capitalism by bringing concrete improvements into the lives of workers. By 1913 Gastev had joined the Circle of Proletarian Culture with Anatoly Lunacharsky, Fedor Kalinin, Pavel Bessalko and Mikhail Gerasimov. In 1917-1918 Gastev won election as the Chairman of the Central Committee of the newly created All-Russian Union of Metal Workers. He actively participated in the 1918 Conference of the Union.\n\nIn 1920, Gastev became the founder and Director of the Central Institute of Labour (C.I.T.) () in Moscow, which he referred to as his \"last work of art\". The organization of the Institute was encouraged by Lenin, who promised to allocate the initial funding of the project. The institution developed scientific approaches to work management, which in practical terms amounted to methods of training workers to perform mechanical operations in the most efficient way. Some simple repetitive operations, like the cutting of materials with a chisel, were studied in great detail. Recommendations on setting up the work processes efficiently were published.\nAccording to Figes (1996), Gastev \"As the head of the Central Institute of Labor, established in 1920, he carried out experiments to train the workers so that they would end up acting like machines. Hundreds of identically dressed trainees would be marched in columns to their benches, and orders would be given out by buzzes from machines. The workers were trained to hammer correctly by holding a hammer attached to and moved by a hammering machine so that after half an hour they had internalized its mechanical rhythm. The same process was repeated for chiseling, filing, and other basic skills. Gastev's aim, by his own admission, was to turn the worker into a sort of 'human robot' (a word, not coincidently, derived from the Slavic noun robota meaning work). Since Gastev saw machines as superior to human beings, he thought this would represent an improvement in humanity.\"\n\nPlaton Kerzhentsev criticised Gastev's Taylorist approach for adopting a \"narrow base\" by focusing on the worker rather than looking at the more general aspects of how production should be organised in a socialist society. In 1921 the Central Council of Scientific Organization of Labor (SOVNOT) was set up with both factions involved. In 1924 the All-Russian Scientific Management Conference was held in Moscow, where both Gastev and Kerzhentsev argued their case. The conference came down on Gastev's side, although Kerzhentsev argued that the CIT had wasted three years.\n\nIn 1928, in an effort to increase the funding of the CIT, Gastev organized the \"Ustanovka\" (\"Setup\") as a social enterprise (joint-stock company) which audited the work of industrial enterprises and provided recommendations on efficient organization of their work processes on a commercial basis. Here Gastev applied his ideas on education, based on his concept of \"social engineering\", meaning the creation of training methods based on the physiological and psychological study of humans in the work process, using both observational and experimental methods. This led to the creation of the \"setup method\" (\"установочный метод\"), which viewed the conditioning of human faculties as a basis for reform of the educational system in its entirety. The term \"setup\" (\"установка\") implied the formation of personal automated behaviors through \"biological setups\", \"cultural setups\", etc. Gastev's methods were used in intensive trainings of qualified workers and were highly successful.\n\nGastev's \"Poeziia rabochego udara\", (Poetry of the worker's blow), was the first book published by Proletkult in 1918.\nMost of Gastev's poems may be fairly labeled prose poetry. The rhythm is usually not organized enough to qualify for verse, the rhyme is absent, the poems are written in the form of prose pieces. However, the use of metaphor, lyrical expressiveness, and repetitiveness of syntax undoubtedly make Gastev a true lyrical poet, with influences ranging from Verhaeren and Walt Whitman to the Russian Futurists.\n\nGastev's poetry energetically celebrates industrialization, announcing an era of a new type of human, trained by the overall mechanization of everyday life. In the 1920s Gastev abandoned his literary work completely, dedicating himself to his scientific management research. However, many of his later publications on non-poetic topics are written in the expressive language of prose poems.\n\nOn September 8, 1938 Gastev was arrested on false charges of \"counter-revolutionary terrorist activity\". He was detained in a Moscow prison and sentenced to death by a speedy trial on April 14, 1939. There was no defense attorney and no possibility to appeal against the decision, as was common during the Great Purge. On April 15, 1939 Gastev was shot to death in the suburbs of Moscow.\n\nOctober 1, 1941, the date of Gastev's death given by some sources, is based on false information given by the authorities to Gastev's family prior to 1991. No reliable information about Gastev's fate after his arrest was available until the KGB archive, where the interrogation and trial documents were kept, became accessible to relatives in the early 1990s.\n\nGastev's legacy is commemorated by the Gastev's Cup by the \"Lean Forum. Lean Production Professionals\" Inter-Regional Public Movement. His son Yuri Gastev was prominent soviet mathematician and dissident who eventually emigrated to the USA.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7724893", "categories": ["Great Purge victims from Russia", "1882 births", "1939 deaths", "Old Bolsheviks", "People from Suzdal"], "title": "Aleksei Gastev"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7724919", "text": "Splice the mainbrace\n\n\"Splice the mainbrace\" is an order given aboard naval vessels to issue the crew with an alcoholic drink. Originally an order for one of the most difficult emergency repair jobs aboard a sailing ship, it became a euphemism for authorized celebratory drinking afterward, and then the name of an order to grant the crew an extra ration of rum or grog.\n\nBraces are the lines that control the angle of the yards. On square-rigged ships, the mainbrace was the longest line in of all the running rigging. It was common to aim for the ship's rigging during naval battles. If the mainbrace was shot away, it was usually necessary to repair it during the engagement; the ship was unmaneuverable without it and would have to stay on the same tack. Even repairing it after the battle was a difficult job; the mainbrace ran through blocks, so it could not be repaired with a short splice or a knot. Splicing in a large run of hemp was strenuous work, and generally the ship's best Able Seamen were chosen to carry out the task under the supervision of the Boatswain (\"bosun\"). On completion of the task, it was customary for the men to be rewarded with an extra ration of rum. The Boatswain would take a sip from the ration of each of the men he had selected for task. Eventually the order to \"splice the mainbrace\" came to mean that the crew would receive an extra ration of rum, and was issued on special occasions: after victory in battle, the change of a monarch, a royal birth, a royal wedding or an inspection of the fleet. In cases where the whole fleet was to receive the signal, it would be run up with a lift of flags or signalled by semaphore.\nA ration of rum a day was standard issue in the Royal Navy until 1970, when concerns over crew members operating machinery under the influence led to the rum ration being abolished. Restrictions were placed on those who could \"splice the mainbrace\": any man or officer over the age of 18 who desired to take it received an extra issue of one-eighth of a pint of rum. Lemonade was issued those who did not wish for the rum. The rum was mixed with water to make grog for all ratings below Petty Officer. Only ratings marked \"G\" (for Grog) in the ship's books could draw rum, grog or lemonade when the mainbrace was spliced and no payment in lieu was available. Those under 20 were marked \"U.A.\" (for under age) in the ship's book; they were similarly barred from drawing the daily rum ration. \"T\" stood for Temperance (for those of Temperance Movement). The issue of rum to wardroom and gunroom officers was stopped in 1881 and ended for warrant officers in 1918; splicing the mainbrace was the only time that officers could be issued with rum.\nOther navies abolished the grog allowance far earlier (the United States Navy after the American Civil War), but the order persisted, allowing the crew to take another drink in place of rum or grog; in 1845 it is recorded as being substituted for the more rowdy \"Crossing the Line\" ceremony. The Royal New Zealand Navy was the last navy to issue junior and senior ratings a daily tot of rum, issuing its last daily rum ration on 1 March 1990. Today the Royal Canadian Navy is more generous with the allowances, allowing crew members to take of spirits compared with the allowed by the Royal Navy, although the Royal Navy does make allowance for paucity of supplies, permitting two cans of beer to be issued if commercial spirits are not available.\n\nThe order \"Splice the Mainbrace\" was still popular with some of the U.S. Navy's submarine fleet during WWII. On , a skipper on combat patrols in WWII, during the boat's 8th and 9th missions in 1944, did in fact announce on the 1MC \"Splice the Mainbrace\" after each successful attack and sinking of a Japanese ship. On \"Barb\" 's 8th combat patrol, the skipper promised the sinking of 5 ships; \"Barb\" delivered. After each sinking the Skipper had a special cake made and each sailor was granted a shot of rot gut whiskey. On the 9th patrol, the Skipper was able to sneak 24 cases of beer aboard which was distributed after each of \"Barb\"'s successful attacks.\n\nPermission to issue the order to splice the mainbrace is heavily restricted; the Royal Navy allows only the Queen, a member of the Royal Family, or the Admiralty Board to do so; the Royal Canadian Navy permits the Queen, the Governor General of Canada, or the Chief of the Defence Staff to issue it. When the Mediterranean fleet received the order from the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII) in 1932 it was the first time it had happened since 1918; it was accompanied by the order to \"Mend and make clothes\", another archaic signal which grants the crew a half-day holiday. Ships in most of the victorious fleets received the order at the end of the Second World War; one ship received the order while still under attack. King George VI issued the order in 1949 to the crew of after the Yangtse Incident. It was ordered on the day of Queen Elizabeth's coronation in 1953, on 29 July 1981 for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer and of Prince William's birth on 21 June 1982, when \"Splice the Mainbrace\" was celebrated in the Fleet just one week after the end of the Falklands War. Nowadays, when rum is no longer issued daily, the order is somewhat more freely given: the Queen issued it after her Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002, after the Trafalgar 200 Fleet Review in 2005, and after her Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012.\n\nIn Canada, the order was most recently given by Queen Elizabeth II on 29 June 2010 at the conclusion of the International Fleet Review for the occasion of the Royal Canadian Navy's 100th Anniversary.

In April 1986, the museum re-opened in the Norfolk and Western Railway Freight Station in downtown Roanoke as the Virginia Museum of Transportation. The museum has earned that title, being recognized by the General Assembly of Virginia as the Commonwealth's official transportation museum.\n\nThe locomotives Norfolk & Western 611 and Norfolk & Western 1218 were originally property of the city of Roanoke due to the museum's original charter. On the April 2, 2012, VMT's 50 Birthday, the city officially gave the locomotives to the museum.\n\nThe Norfolk and Western Railway Freight Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. The station consists of two clearly identifiable sections, both of which were completed in 1918. They are the two-story, fifty-bay-long, freight station proper which was built parallel to the railroad tracks and now is oriented south, and the one-story-with-basement brick annex that formerly housed the offices of the Shenandoah and Radford divisions of the Norfolk and Western. The building closed for railroad freight business in 1964.\n\nMany of the museum's antique automobiles are on display here as well. The museum also features occasional special exhibits such as the \"Hollywood Star Cars\" exhibit which showcased famous cars from the history of television and movies.\n\nOn-going exhibits cover sundry aspects of railroad life in America, especially Virginia. In addition to these on-going exhibits, the museum maintains an O-Gauge train layout modeled after Roanoke, Salem, and Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 20, 2011 to May 3, the museum was home to Chesapeake and Ohio 614 as part of the museum's \"Thoroughbreds of Steam\" exhibit.\nOther pieces include automobiles such as a 1913 Metz, a 1920 Buick touring car, a Highway Post Office Bus, and an armored car used to showcase the United States Bill of Rights in 1991.\n\nThough the most prominent pieces of the museum's collection are the two Norfolk & Western engines, there are more than fifty pieces of rolling stock in the collection. Some exhibits may be closed to the public as restoration is in progress on some pieces. While most of the railyard is ADA-accessible to view the rolling stock, entry into the pieces are not as they were built long before the standards of 1990. Some of the museum's collection needs heavy restoration and is stored offsite on a track allowed by Norfolk Southern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe museum is currently seeking exhibits for their aviation gallery while it is under construction.\n\n", "id": "7724947", "categories": ["Automobile museums in Virginia", "Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia", "Railroad museums in Virginia", "National Register of Historic Places in Roanoke, Virginia", "Aerospace museums in Virginia"], "title": "Virginia Museum of Transportation"}

A later E95 model was developed with an inclined-engine. AMC produced AJS and Matchless brands at the time.\n\nThe motorcycle was originally designed by AJS to be supercharged, as were a number of pre-war racing bikes, but the FICM banned supercharging in 1946. The motor was then worked on to allow it to perform without a supercharger. Jock West first rode the machine at the 1947 Isle of Man TT where he experienced teething problems relegating him to a 15th place, although he recorded the third fastest lap time of the race. Leslie Graham then rode the bike to victory in the inaugural 1949 FIM 500cc world championship. This was the only World Championship win for AJS. Despite this victory, the bike is often cited as unreliable, and not living up to its promise.\n\nThe E90S Porcupine engine was a unit construction, aluminium alloy, 500 cc, DOHC twin, with horizontal cylinders and heads, to give the bike a low centre of gravity. A later version of this motor was named the E95, re-engineered to have its cylinders inclined at 45 degrees for better cooling and easier carburettor installation, and is claimed to have produced 55 bhp @ 7600 rpm\n\nThe gear drive for the camshafts was on the right of the motor, while the gear primary drive was on the left. The geared primary drive meant that the motor ran \"backwards\". The cam gear drive also drove a jackshaft at the rear of the cylinders, which drove an oil pump, a fuel pump, and (via a chain drive) a Lucas magneto. The four-speed gearbox output was on the right.\n\nAs originally designed, the E90S was to be supercharged, with the blower mounted above the gearbox, and driven by the clutch. The loss of the supercharger meant that the design was compromised, lacking sufficient flywheel effect, which caused problems with magneto failure. The main initial change was to reduce the valve angle to 90 degrees for a more compact combustion chamber. \n\nIt had rubber mounted twin GP carburettors, inclined at 49 degrees, with an unusual float tank system used rather than float bowls. Plain bearings were used for the big end bearings and the centre main bearings. The outer main bearings were rollers. One problem cited for the engine is the use of non parallel valves with conventional rockers.\n\nThe 1947 model engine was mostly made of alloy, but, as an experiment, the head was cast in silver for increased thermal efficiency. Due to the softness of silver, it had to be alloyed to make it hard enough for racing use. By the time this was achieved the thermal efficiency gains were lost, and the experiment was abandoned. There is dispute as to whether the silver cylinder head went beyond feasibility-study stage.\n\nThe Porcupine used \"Jam-pot\" shocks and Teledraulic race forks. The E90 model had an open frame. The E95, introduced in 1953, had a loop type frame with the motor mounted lower.\n\nOnly four E95 Porcupines were built.\n\nTeam Obsolete have restored a 1954 AJS Porcupine E95, using an ex-Tom Arter MKII motor, which features a unique Jack Williams built up roller bearing crankshaft. They use it for exhibition and historic racing.\n\nTom Arter put a complete 1954 E95 AJS Porcupine up for auction, and it sold for $228,620.\n\nA 1954 AJS E95 Porcupine was sold post-auction at Bonhams in 2011, for $675,000 (plus fees).\n\n", "id": "7724968", "categories": ["AJS motorcycles", "Grand Prix motorcycles"], "title": "AJS Porcupine"}

It was first published in 1928 by Oxford University Press and was edited by Percy Dearmer, Martin Shaw and Ralph Vaughan Williams. It became a widely used source of carols among choirs and church congregations in Britain.\n\nVaughan Williams was a noted composer and arranger of music in the Anglican Church and a founder member of the English Folk Dance and Song Society. He was a scholar of English folk-song and his music was greatly influenced by traditional folk forms. Vaughan Williams had collaborated with Percy Dearmer on the production of the \"English Hymnal\", which was published in 1906, and as with this hymnal, \"The Oxford Book of Carols\" favoured traditional folk tunes and polyphonic arrangements of carols, instead of the Victorian hymn tunes that Vaughan Williams considered to be over-sentimental and Germanic in tone. Vaughan Williams in particular drew on music from his own childhood and his scholarship of English folk music, and was driven by his conviction that the music of ordinary people should be valued.\n\n\"The Oxford Book of Carols\" has been reprinted many times. It was re-engraved and reset in a slightly larger format in 1964, at which time some of the medieval carols were re-edited. The most recent impression is dated 26 January 1984 and is still in print.\n\n\"The New Oxford Book of Carols\" was published in 1992 by OUP. Anthologists Hugh Keyte and Andrew Parrott make few references to OBC in their Introduction and their aim appears the same as Dearmer's in 1928. The enormous task was shared by both sets of anthologists and Keyte and Parrott issued \"The Shorter New Oxford Book of Carols\" in 1993.\n\n", "id": "7724974", "categories": ["Music books", "1928 books", "Anglican hymnals", "Oxford University Press books", "1928 in Christianity", "Christmas carol collections", "1928 in music"], "title": "The Oxford Book of Carols"}

For these actions, he was incarcerated at the Montreal Pied-du-Courant Prison and was hanged at the site by the British authorities.\n\nde Lorimier was born in Saint-Cuthbert, Lower Canada. \n\nOn January 11, 1839 de Lorimier and three of his comrades (two of whom managed to escape before being executed; the other was Chevrier Bénard) appeared before the British Council of War. Refused his request for a trial in a civilian court, de Lorimier apparently effectively defended himself and challenged the crown's evidence. However, Jean-Baptiste-Henri Brien, one of his co-accused and terrified of the scaffold, signed a confession incriminating de Lorimier and others and the British authorities, having failed to seize the main leaders of the rebellion, arguably pursued his death to make an example. On January 21 de Lorimier and his companions were found guilty of high treason and sentenced to be hanged which took place on February 15, 1839, together with Charles Hindelang, Amable Daunais, François Nicolas and Pierre-Rémi Narbonne.\n\nThe day before, de Lorimier wrote his political testament:\n\nI die without remorse; in the insurrection I only desired the well-being and independence [from Britain] of my country. My views and my actions were sincere and were innocent of any of the crimes which dis-honor mankind, and which are too common when released passions boil up... In spite of so many mishaps, my heart still keeps its courage and its hopes for the future; my children and my friends will see better days. Looking tranquilly ahead, I am sure that they will win freedom. That is what fills me with joy when all around me is sorry and desolation... I leave behind me children whose only heritage is the memory of my misfortune. Poor orphans, it is you who are to be pitied, you whom the bloody and arbitrary hand of the law strikes through my death. You will have no gentile and affectionate memories of happy days with your father. When you are old enough to reflect, you will see in your father a man who has paid on the scaffold for actions such as have immortalized other happier men. The only crime of your father was his failure.\n\nHe was executed with such people as the French-born Charles Hindelang. His character plays a notable role in Pierre Falardeau's film \"February 15, 1839\" about the incarceration and execution of the Patriotes. de Lorimier Avenue honours his memory in Montreal.\n\n\n", "id": "7724994", "categories": ["1803 births", "Canadian notaries", "Executed Canadian people", "1839 deaths", "Executed revolutionaries", "People executed by Lower Canada", "19th-century executions by the United Kingdom", "Executed French people", "People executed by Canada by hanging", "Quebec revolutionaries", "People executed by British North America by hanging", "Lower Canada Rebellion people"], "title": "François-Marie-Thomas Chevalier de Lorimier"}

It was founded as an Evangelical Christian ex-gay organisation that sought to change gay people to straight, but subsequently rejected the idea that sexual orientation could or should be changed and now exists as a pro-gay evangelical Christian ministry.\n\nThe membership of Courage UK in 2006 has been stated to be about 150 men.\n\nCourage UK was founded in February 1988 by Jeremy Marks. The group used to be affiliated with the ex-gay movement and was once a member of Exodus International. In 2002, the organisation abandoned those views and its affiliation with the ex-gay movement. At the time of its founding, the group's efforts were considered progressive, because it reached out to gay people rather than condemning them to hell.\n\nBy 2000, Jeremy Marks and the leadership of Courage UK recognised a change was needed. The expectation of the ex-gay teaching did not equal the results they saw. Gay participants trying to become straight through the organisation became severely depressed and attempted suicide; Marks observed that only those who accepted that they were gay and found a partner were happy and successful. The teaching that gay people must get into a heterosexual relationship or remain celibate now seemed questionable to Marks. This was not only from an experiential viewpoint, but also from a theological change. In 2001, Jeremy Marks wrote in the journal \"Lesbian and Gay Christians\", \"I have come to the conclusion that we have been quite wrong to dismiss all same sex love (other than platonic) as sinful\"; the group's change of position was motivated by the belief that the Bible says man should not be alone and that a loving God would not deny gay people the opportunity to love.\n\nMarks' comments on the Courage UK website clarify the group's change of course:\n\n\"A Change of Heart is the Priority\"\nWhile recognising the social pressure to become 'normal' (i.e. heterosexual), fifteen years experience revealed that God's primary concern is not to change the sexual orientation of his gay and lesbian disciples, but to help them find wholeness in Christ - becoming secure, assured of his love and acceptance, set apart to follow Jesus faithfully and responsible in building relationships with one another.\nAs a direct result of the New Approach, Courage took a \"sabbatical\" from Exodus International.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7725087", "text": "Christ II\n\nChrist II, also called The Ascension, is one of Cynewulf’s four signed poems that exist in the Old English vernacular. It is a five-section piece that spans lines 440–866 of the Christ triad in the \"Exeter Book\" (folios 14a-20b), and is homiletic in its subject matter in contrast to the martyrological nature of \"Juliana\", \"Elene\", and \"Fates of the Apostles\". \"Christ II\" draws upon a number of ecclesiastical sources, but it is primarily framed upon Gregory the Great’s \"Homily XXIX\" on Ascension Day.\n\nThe poem is assigned to a triad of Old English religious poems in the Exeter Book, known collectively as \"Christ\". \"Christ\" comprises a total of 1664 lines and deals with Christ's Advent, Ascension and Last Judgment. It was originally thought to be one piece completed by a single author, but the poem is now broken up into three parts.\n\nThe poem \"Christ\" was originally thought to be one piece completed by a single author. Almost all scholars now break the poems into three parts: \"Christ I\" is focused on Advent, \"Christ II\", on the Ascension, and \"Christ III\" primarily dealing with Doomsday. The poems are the first items in the Exeter Book which is a rather large manuscript that has 123 (some sources argue 131) folios contained in it. The Exeter Book has been at the Exeter Cathedral Library since 1072 where it was donated by Bishop Leofric. No one is exactly positive where the Exeter Book originated. Some argue it was written in a monastic institution in Exeter in the 7th century while others state it originated in Canterbury or Glastonbury. The book contains 123 leaves, or 246 pages, with a few random missing pages because the book was unbound for a long period of time. Many other pages have holes from burns, cuts by a knife, and stains by a pot of liquid. \n\"Christ\" is the longest poem by far in the book if one looks at it as an entirety. \"Christ II\" has some similar themes to the rest of the \"Christ\" poem but it is also very different. All three poems have a unique identity and narrative voice that differs from the others. \"Christ II\" is clearly based on the 29th homily that Pope Gregory the Great wrote. Pope Gregory the Great was well known for being the father of Roman Christianity in England, believed to have started the constitution of liturgy, and the compilation of musical service-songbooks used in the church. Gregory focused the end section of his homily on why angels didn’t wear white robes at the Incarnation but did at the Ascension.\n\nCynewulf receives credit for writing \"Christ II\", but his inspiration came from the 23rd Psalm and a homily written by Pope Gregory. Cynewulf is one of the two only named Anglo-Saxon poets. His name is found as Cyniwulf, Cynewulf, and Cynwulf; he is also responsible for at least \"Christ II\", \"Juliana\", \"The Fates of the Apostles\", and \"Elene\". Scholars believe that Cynewulf did not write before 750 because he used an \"e\" instead of an \"i\" which was not established until that time. Most would assume that he was not writing after the 10th century either. Some research showed that Cynewulf’s \"Elene\" corresponded with a portion of a book that was dedicated to Charlemagne as Emperor around 800. Even though there are no certain dates to when Cynewulf lived or the Exeter Book was compiled, there is a general theory about when they were inspired.\n\nCynewulf has been greatly studied by scholars to figure out where he exactly lived as well. Some think Cynewulf is from Dunwich because he knew a lot about the sea, but there has never been any hard evidence that verified any of these hypotheses. It has been suggested that Cynewulf was a thegn or retainer to a lord at probably a younger point in his life, and he certainly did not come from noble birth. Cynewulf positively learned the Latin rudiments so many assume that he probably attended the Minster School of York. Most people would also believe that he was either a monk or a priest, and possibly even both. He was a normal orthodox believer of his time who agreed with Gregory the Great on everything except for Purgatory. Cynewulf praised the Trinity as being three separate but combined parts, thought sinners may obtain a pardon from hell if they repent and turn from their sins, and assumed saints could intercede in earthly matters.\n\nCynewulf’s identity is still largely unknown, but we can be positive that he placed his signature in four separate poems. Cynewulf signed his poems using runes which come from the Germanic alphabet that Anglo-Saxons used before switching to the Roman alphabet. A rune can stand for an actual letter or for the word of its name. The first rune cen(c) stands for ‘torch’ while yr(y) represents ‘bow’. These words are sometimes substituted in order to make more grammatical sense so it can be extremely difficult to search and find Cynewulf’s signature. At the end of The Fates of the Apostles, Cynewulf signs his names F, W, U, L, C, Y, N. It is assumed that he did this to show that he was a sinner like everyone else or to relate to the Biblical idea that ‘the last shall be first’.\n\n\"Christ II\" begins by stating how important it is for men to seek out the truth and where it came from. Christ was born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem. After he was crucified and rose from the dead he spent forty days on earth before ascending back to heaven. Before Christ left he said to gathered people, “Rejoice in spirit! I shall never leave you, but I shall always continue in love towards you and give you power and remain with you for ever and ever so that by my grace you will never be wanting in virtue.” \nAfter Christ had given his speech, a large number of angels appeared above the temple. They asked the people why they were just standing around and waiting. The angels explained to the people that they were there to escort Christ back to his home in heaven. The people were warned to be ready for the time when Christ would return to judge everyone for the deeds that they have committed. The clouds surrounded Jesus and the angels and joy rang out throughout all of heaven. But the people who had just witnessed this were very sad because of their loss. Men and women were crying and everyone’s hearts were heavy. \nIt is extremely important that we praise God for all the blessings he has bestowed on us. People need to thank the Lord for food, possessions, weather and shelter, along with the sun and moon. Praise needs to be given for the dew and rain which supply the earth. Most of all, God needs to be thanked for the salvation that he freely gives us a chance to have. Now we no longer need to suffer in the pain and misery we once had. \nLong ago, the prophet Job called the Lord’s son a bird who would not be understood by many people. The bird flew from his home and came to earth in human form. After all of his work had been done by the grace of God he flew (ascended) back to his home in heaven. There the Lord created mansions for his people. He also instilled wisdom in the minds of his followers and gave others the gift of singing. The Lord also blessed some with skilled fingers for playing the harp or the ability to write down languages. He stands as an upright tree that one can cling to in a time of need. The Lord is willing to give man many gifts, including wisdom, if he can cast his own pride aside. \nAfter Christ had returned to heaven, many of his church followers faced tough oppression. Pagan governments were in charge and they didn’t allow them to worship. The pagans destroyed and burned God’s temple and killed many. The Lord will redeem His people and all the problems that they have faced. King Solomon gives hope to the people when he sang, “(the Lord) will garland the hills and heights with his glory; he will redeem the world, all earth’s inhabitants, by that glorious spring.”\nThe poem then focuses on the six leaps that Christ has already made. His first leap (\"se forma hlyp\") was when he descended to the earth through the Virgin Mary. The second spring (\"se oþer stiell\") was when he was born in the manger. His third leap (\"se þridda hlyp\"), Christ ascended the cross (\"he on rode astag\"). His fourth spring (\"se feorða stiell\") was when he abandoned the cross (\"he þone beam ofgeaf\") and entered the tomb. His fifth leap (\"se fifta hlyp\") was when he went to hell before his resurrection. The sixth leap (\"se siexta hlyp\") was when the Lord ascended into the heavens with the joyous jubilation of the angels. The motif of Christ’s leaps derives from Pope Gregory’s \"Twenty-ninth Homily on the Gospels\" (or \"Ascension Homily\") of \"Homiliae XL in euangelia\". The motif is a mystical interpretation of the Song of Solomon (Canticles 2.8) and is found as early as the third century in the work of Hippolytus. \nOn earth, our Father travelled from place to place and leaped from hillside to mountainside. We must act in accordance so that we may make the same ascension that He did. Men need to believe that the Son and Savior will return to take us from this place. Therefore, we need to turn from our evil ways and desires. Men need to be constantly aware that our enemy (Satan) is looking for a chance to penetrate us with one of his arrows. Pray that the Lord will keep the enemy far away and shield us from him. \nThe time will come when Christ will return to judge us for the lives that we have lived. He will be harsh on those who have not kept the commands in his books. It is important to pay attention to your soul and what state it is in because the Lord will return with his legions of angels. When he does return, He will be “rigorous, angry, and righteous.” This will be the greatest terror that anyone has ever seen on this earth. Men must focus on their soul’s appearance because Christ is coming to judge both the loved and the loathed.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7725087", "categories": ["Literary portrayals of Jesus", "Old English poems"], "title": "Christ II"}

During the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 220), this was a pass through which the Silk Road passed, and was the one road connecting Central Asia and China, the former called the Western Regions. Just to the south was the Yangguan pass, which was also an important point on the Silk Road.\n\nAlthough the Chinese \"guan\" is usually translated simply as \"pass\", its more specific meaning is a \"frontier pass\" to distinguish it from an ordinary pass through the mountains. \"Yumen guan\" 玉門關 and \"Yang guan\" 陽關 are derived from: \"yu\" 玉 = 'jade' + \"men\" 門 = 'gate', 'door'; and \"yang\" 陽 = 'sunny side', 'south side of a hill', 'north side of a river,' and \"guan\" 關 = ‘frontier-passes’. These were the two most famous passes leading to the north and west from Chinese territory. During the Early Han, \"... a defensive line was established from Jiuquan ('Wine Springs') in the \"Gansu\" Corridor west to the Jade Gate Pass at its end.\" \n\nIt is not to be confused with the city Yumen (玉門, literally \"Jade Gate\") in Gansu, China.

Their motto is \"Pick on someone your own caliber\".\n\nInspired by a Salon.com article written by Jonathan Rauch, Krikket (aka Doug Krick), a libertarian activist from Illinois while living in Massachusetts, founded the Pink Pistols in July 2000. The organization had at least 45 chapters, as of October 2014. Those chapters are located in 33 states and three countries that are principally made up of gun-owning LGBT individuals, though neither status is mandatory for membership.\n\nThe political orientation of the Pink Pistols is considered unusual due to the popular perception in the United States of firearms ownership as a \"conservative issue\" and sexuality as a \"liberal issue\". However, there is nothing within either of these two single issues that is mutually exclusive and a variety of other pro-gun organizations exist for groups not typically associated with gun rights (for example, the \"Democrats for the Second Amendment\").\n\nPink Pistols' activities include firing range visits and political activism. The group occasionally produces report cards on politicians, rating their position on issues of interest to members. According to pinkpistols.org:\n\nThe Pink Pistol's symbol consists of an overhead view of a picto-person aiming a handgun in an isosceles stance superimposed on a pink triangle. The pink triangle, now a gay pride and gay rights symbol, was originally a badge that homosexual concentration camp victims were forced to wear during the Holocaust.\n\nAccording to spokesperson Gwen Patton, \"We don't want people to hurt us, we want people to run away from us, and the best way we have found to do that is to be armed.\" Patton has also stated that, \"the Pink Pistols tend to get a better response from firearms supporters than from homosexuals\".\n\nThe group's membership increased from 1,500 to 4,500 in the week after the 2016 mass shooting at an Orlando, Florida gay nightclub. As of June 24, 2016, the membership is over 7,000, and there are 36 chapters around the country. The group experienced a further rise in interest following Donald Trump's election to the presidency later that year. By April 2017, the group claimed a membership of over 9,000.\n\nOn 23 September 2018, trans woman Erin Palette became the new president of the Pink Pistols.\n\n\n", "id": "7725096", "categories": ["LGBT political advocacy groups in the United States", "Organizations established in 2000", "Self-defense", "Gun rights advocacy groups in the United States", "Libertarian organizations based in the United States"], "title": "Pink Pistols"}

The Späth nursery of Berlin, however, which marketed 'Hoersholmiensis' in the interwar period, considered it a hybrid rather than a form of field elm, a view shared by Christine Buisman, who in 1931 labelled a herbarium specimen from a Späth-sourced tree in The Hague as a form of \"Ulmus\" × \"hollandica\".\n\nThe tree has an upright habit and rapid growth. The leaves, 8 – 14 cm long by 3 – 5 cm wide, are lanceolate or narrowly obovate, acuminate at the tip and with a cuneate base, light green in colour, turning a deep yellow in autumn. \n'Hoersholmiensis' is susceptible to Dutch elm disease and Coral-spot Fungus \"Nectria cinnabarina\".\nThe tree is cultivated in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. In Denmark it is usually propagated by base-grafting on wych elm. Here the oldest known plantation was 65 trees on the Tuborgvej, Copenhagen, planted in 1906. The Späth nursery of Berlin distributed 'Hoersholmiensis' from the late 1920s. It was planted in the Netherlands, notably along the Westlandsgracht in Amsterdam where it still survives, although upper branches are often killed by Coral-spot Fungus. Fontaine reported it a useful wind-break tree.\n\nThe tree has reputedly been planted in Hove, but does not feature in the NCCPG National Elm Collection held there.\nFine unpruned specimens stand in Stockholm, in Raoul Wallenberg square and the Karlaplan. \nThe tree was hybridized with 'Commelin' and \"U. pumila\" as part of the Dutch elm breeding programme at the De Dorschkamp Institute, Wageningen. Seeds arising from the crossing were donated by Hans Heybroek to the University of Wisconsin-Madison programme in 1960. The clone 'Regal' was a frost-hardy selection from the resultant seedlings, whilst the later 1984 USDA release 'Homestead' arose from the crossing of another with \"U. pumila\".\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7725118", "categories": ["Ulmus articles with images", "Field elm cultivar"], "title": "Ulmus minor 'Hoersholmiensis'"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7725127", "text": "Punk rock in Australia\n\nAustralian musicians played and recorded some of the earliest punk rock. The Saints released their first single in 1976. Bands playing subgenres or offshoots of punk music, such as local hardcore acts, still have a strong cult following throughout Australia. Fans started to form bands, both punk and dissimilar in sound, beginning a distinct Brisbane punk scene, one of the first in the world. By 1977, other bands were starting to form in Sydney, under the influence of local and overseas punk acts. These bands and other Australian and overseas punk acts were strongly supported by public radio stations. The Young Charlatans had formed in Melbourne out of the ashes of earlier bands. During the late 1970s, former members of Radio Birdman contributed to several new Sydney bands. The Quick and the Dead, who played in Perth during 1979–81, pioneered a sound closely related to Oi!.\n\nThe Saints were one of Australia's first punk bands. The earliest incarnation of The Saints was formed by Ed Kuepper (guitar) and Chris Bailey (vocals) in Brisbane, Queensland in 1973. They shared a background in immigrant families (Kuepper's German and Bailey's Irish), and an admiration for high energy 1950s and '60s music, such as the Detroit rock of The Stooges and MC5. Queensland at the time was controlled by the conservative, authoritarian Country Party democratic government of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen – an environment with plenty of inspiration for creative and alienated young people. The result was a frenetic, pulsating sound, topped with Bailey's sardonic lyrics. Unable to get regular gigs, they played at a house in inner city Petrie Terrace, where they soon attracted unwanted attention. Police arrested fans for trivial offences, often in a brutal fashion, but their approach only created more interest in the punk scene. The Saints gigs' got bigger and their fans started to form bands, both punk and dissimilar in sound, beginning a distinct Brisbane punk scene, one of the first in the world.\n\nDuring 1974, Radio Birdman formed in Sydney, led by another immigrant, Detroit-born medical student Deniz Tek. They also shared an interest in The Stooges and MC5, albeit with a result arguably more akin to Hard Rock than Punk. Their dynamic live shows soon gained a fanatical following at inner city venues. Many art rock bands, like Melbourne's Boys Next Door, formed by Nick Cave and Mick Harvey at their school in 1974, later attended gigs by The Saints and Radio Birdman, and would adopt elements of their sounds.\n\nIn Perth – a geographically isolated city with social and political similarities to Brisbane – young musicians like Kim Salmon, Dave Faulkner and James Baker were also influenced by the Detroit bands, as well as New York proto-punk figures like Lou Reed and the New York Dolls. Salmon led the Cheap Nasties, and then The Scientists, before embarking on a solo career (and is regarded as a pioneer of grunge). Baker was in a short-lived act called The Geeks, before forming The Victims with Faulkner in 1977. They recorded an acclaimed single, \"Television Addict\", before breaking up. Baker later joined The Scientists. Faulkner gravitated towards poppier sounds. (In 1981, he and Baker founded a successful Retro rock act, the Hoodoo Gurus.)\n\nIn mid-1976, The Saints recorded and distributed copies of their single \"(I'm) Stranded\", which met nearly no critical or public response in Australia. In the UK, however,\"Sounds\" magazine received a copy, and declared it: \"single of this and every week\". As a result, the band was signed to a three-album contract with EMI. Later the same year they recorded their first LP, which was also called \"(I'm) Stranded\". Hampered by poor production and the indifference of radio stations, the LP failed commercially. In December The Saints moved to Sydney. Radio Birdman released an EP (\"Burn My Eye\") and an album (\"Radios Appear\") with better production values, but with similar commercial results to The Saints' endeavours.\n\nBy 1977, other bands were starting to form in Sydney, under the influence of local and overseas punk acts. The early Sydney punk scene centred around the Sydney inner city suburbs, and the Grand Hotel in Haymarket in particular. Among the first was The Last Words, from Liverpool in Sydney. (They recorded their first single \"Animal World/Wondering Why\" in 1977.) Other Sydney bands in 1977 included the Hellcats (featuring Ron Peno, later lead singer of the Died Pretty), the Psychosurgeons (later known as Lipstick Killers), Johnny Dole & The Scabs and the Thought Criminals (who featured Steven Phillip, later of Do-Re-Mi and John Hoey, who was also later in Died Pretty).\n\nThese bands and other Australian and overseas punk acts were strongly supported by public radio stations, especially 2JJ. Punk bands like The Reals (featuring Ollie Olsen) and The Babeez (later known as The News) were also being formed in Melbourne. In Brisbane, The Survivors (who showed a 1960s influence), The Leftovers (diverse influences), Razar (contemporary British punk) and the Fun Things (Detroit rock) all followed in the wake of the Saints.\n\nAfter the British punk scene took off in 1977, both The Saints and Radio Birdman moved to the UK. This proved to be disastrous for both bands. Neither of them fit in with, or were inclined to adjust to aspects of the London scene at the time, such the now-established punk fashion in clothes. Radio Birdman were dumped when their record company got into financial difficulty, and soon broke up. Later recordings saw The Saints adopt soul, blues and jazz influences, although their most successful single, \"This Perfect Day\" – which reached number 34 in the UK pop charts – was typical of the band's musical style. After another acclaimed single, \"Know Your Product\", and second and third albums failed to make an impression, EMI dropped The Saints. (Kuepper left in 1979 and Bailey began to pursue a more mainstream musical direction.) Last Words later followed their predecessors to the UK and also failed to make a strong impression.\n\nBy the end of 1977, the \"supergroup\" Young Charlatans had formed in Melbourne out of the ashes of earlier bands. Ollie Olsen, Rowland S. Howard (guitar, later in The Birthday Party), Jeff Wegener (drums, former member of The Saints, later in the Laughing Clowns) and Janine Hall (later in The Saints). The band recorded the first version of the Howard song \"Shivers\" (made famous by the Boys Next Door and hard rockers Screaming Jets). In Sydney, a Birdman offshoot, The Hitmen, had started to gig and Ian Rilen formed the longevitous X.\n\nEntrepreneurs began to realise the potential of the growing scene and Michael Gudinski launched the Melbourne-based Suicide Records, which in May 1978 released a compilation, \"Lethal Weapons\". The album included tracks by the Boys Next Door, Teenage Radio Stars (featuring future Models members Sean Kelly and James Freud, and also La Femme members bassist Graham Schiavello and drummer Pete Kidd), JAB (ex-experimental rockers from Adelaide, featuring Bohdan X and synthesizer player Ash Wednesday), The Survivors and X-Ray-Z (former pub rockers from Adelaide). However the royalty rate offered by Suicide was low and both The News and Young Charlatans decided not to get involved. Keith Glass launched the Melbourne-based Missing Link Records, which between 1978–80 released La Femme's singles & Album, They were the first independent band on \"Countdown\" and opened \"Suburban pub rock\" to local punk bands. Keith Glass also managed the Boys Next Door and released all their music through to the change to The Birthday Party.\n\nAustralian chart success eluded all of these bands in the late 1970s. Radio programmers were conservative and unenthusiastic about punk. The above artists who eventually found success either did so overseas, or after a remove of several years in Australia, and/or in different bands.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, former members of Radio Birdman contributed to several new Sydney bands: The New Christs, The Visitors, The Passengers (featuring Angie Pepper) and The Screaming Tribesmen. Two distinctive, long-lasting Sydney bands, The Celibate Rifles and Lime Spiders, were formed in 1979. In Melbourne, post-punk sounds began to take over, typified by the \"little band scene\". By the early 1980s, only a handful of bands were still playing songs with classic punk sounds, such as the Cosmic Psychos and the satirically-inclined Painters and Dockers.\n\nMelbourne’s La Femme were a fascinating meld of late Seventies influences: punk, new wave, glam and hard rock. Their 1978 debut single Chelsea Kids is one of the all-time classic Australian singles and their only LP: La Femme, is arguably one of the best to come out of Melbourne's late 1970s punk/new wave scene (which included Models and The Boys Next Door). It contains many fine examples of the band’s confident, swaggering glam-infused punk-metal sound. Lead singer Chane Chane was a charismatic, hyperactive front man, a refreshing personality with a strong audience rapport. Guitarist Brett Walker was a real live flashy guitar hero for the times, coming on like a punk-metal Mick Ronson by pealing off large chunks of dense power riffing when other guitarists were still going plink-plonk. The thuggish rhythm section of Peter Kidd and Graham Schiavello played it mean and hard, providing the relentless, driving beat. La Femme could well have made it into the big league if they’d wanted but swimming against the commercial tide seemed to be their raison d'être. In many ways they were their own worst enemies. An unwillingness to play the pop star game and the serious drug addiction, among other things, perhaps ended up compromising the band’s drive. For an inner-city band with so much potential, in the end they really did give it away. They toured constantly, built up a huge support base on the suburban pub circuit, scored several prestigious support gigs, made three appearances on Countdown (one of the first punk/new wave/alternative bands to do so), released one of the great Melbourne punk albums and yet they never rose above being a cult attraction.\n\nThe Quick and the Dead, who played in Perth during 1979–81, pioneered a sound closely related to Oi!. They attracted media attention resulting from the behaviour of some fans, including violence and the use of Nazi regalia. Some Brisbane punk rock bands prolonged their unique punk direction from the Seventies, that was in part due to Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen's continued use of the Queensland Police against perceived threats to the government.\n\nThe Boys Next Door, renamed The Birthday Party in 1980 and featuring Nick Cave, were pioneers in incorporating \"darker\" elements into their image, with connections to the genres of gothic rock, horror punk and deathrock. Other prominent examples included Brisbane bands Vampire Lovers (band) and Mystery of Sixes.\n\nA fourth generation of bands, such as the Hard-Ons (from Sydney) and Exploding White Mice (from Adelaide), also emerged. Former members of The Celibate Rifles and Lime Spiders formed The Eastern Dark, a short-lived but well-regarded act.Australian hardcore punk acts also emerged, such as Massappeal, who began gigging in Sydney during 1985.\n\nFrom Brunswick emerged the smooth distorted sound of the Zorros with their single from Missing Link records \"Too Young\" reaching Number 3 in Radio RRR charts. The Zorros would play hard and fast and pack out many venues.\n\nBy the early 1990s, the success of grunge music, American punk veterans and revivalists, as well as local bands like The Hybernators, The Speed Demons, The Meanies, Frenzal Rhomb, and Screamfeeder led to the formation of punk-influenced bands such as The Living End, Jebediah, Bodyjar, 28 Days, Dreamkillers, Four Zero One Four, Align, and Guttersnipes. Punk revival scenes began in various cities around Australia.\n\nIn one of these cities (Melbourne) punk has seen a resurgence in recent years. Along with straight up punk bands like Dixon Cider, Scrayfish, The Half Pints, Let's Jump Ship and The Flying Rats forming, there have also been the emergence of folk punk bands like Gentleman's Riot, Mutiny and Catgut Mary and skate punk bands such as Bombs Are Falling and Postscript . The reforming of many earlier punk bands from the 1980s (such as Bastard Squad and Depression) has also been prominent.\nThe Late 2000s has also seen a resurgence in street punk across the Australian east coast with bands like No Idea (VIC), The Scam(QLD), The Lost Cause (QLD), Deputy Dipshit (QLD),The Worst (VIC), Stay Down (TAS), Wot Rot (VIC) and many more leaving their mark.\n\nVans Warped Tour successfully returned to Australia in 2013 after an 11-year hiatus, however many DIY grass roots events have stepped up to fill the gap.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7725127", "categories": ["Australian fringe and underground culture", "Australian punk rock groups", "Australian styles of music", "Punk by country"], "title": "Punk rock in Australia"}

It is a remake of the 1912 hand-colored, black-and-white film \"The Miracle\", which was in turn a production of the 1911 pantomime play, \"The Miracle\", written by Karl Vollmöller and directed by Max Reinhardt.\n\nThe 1959 film version for Warner Bros. was shot in Technirama and Technicolor, with an original score by Elmer Bernstein. The film was shot in the Los Angeles area, the Gypsy camp sequence was shot in the Santa Susana Mountains around Calabasas, California.\nTeresa (Carroll Baker), a postulant at the convent of Miraflores in Salamanca, Spain, is an orphan taken in by the sisters there. She enjoys the convent life, despite being a handful for her superiors. She sings worldly love songs to the other postulants and reads secular stories and plays such as \"Romeo and Juliet\". Still, she has a lively devotion to Christ and to His Blessed Mother. A statue of the Madonna, in fact, is held in high regard by Teresa as she goes about her duties.\n\nWhen the British march through the town on their way to battle Napoleon, Teresa is drawn to a handsome captain (Roger Moore) she sees while he waters his horse. After a defeat at the Battle of Salamanca the British regiment limps back to the convent which the Mother Superior offers as a hospital for the wounded. Here Teresa learns more about the young captain who had attracted her interest. He is Michael Stuart, he finds Teresa fascinating, and before long he and Teresa find themselves falling in love.\n\nRecovered, the soldiers march out of the convent grounds to be billeted in the nearby town of Miraflores. The seventeen-year-old Teresa is filled with desire for Michael and begins to question her calling. Returning to duty, Michael asks Teresa to marry him; she hesitates, but runs after him. They kiss and Michael proposes that they meet at the town's inn if she wants to leave the religious life and marry him.\n\nTeresa is in a quandary. In the chapel she begs for guidance. When no tangible sign is forthcoming she strips off her postulant's habit, wraps a cloak about herself and dashes off into the night to meet with Michael in the town. At this point the miracle occurs. The cherished statue of the Virgin Mary comes to life, dons the discarded habit, and secretly takes Teresa's place at the convent.\n\nA thunderstorm roars up as the statue of the Holy Mother steps off its pedestal, but it is the last rain the people of the valley will see for several years. A period of drought begins in the surrounding countryside, seriously damaging the local crops. (The townspeople are convinced that the beneficent intercession of the Virgin Mary has caused the area to flourish, and their belief seems to contain an element of truth for the drough began with the disappearance of the Blessed Mother's statue.)\n\nThe French return to the town and ravage the people. Teresa is nearly raped by a French sergeant, but is saved by a band of gypsies. One of them is a handsome young man for whom the French have offered a reward, calling him Guido the Gypsy (Vittorio Gassman). He is the gypsies' leader. He has Michael's watch, which he gives Teresa when she reacts to the tune that plays when the case is opened (Michael had shown her the watch before.). Guido's brother, Carlito (Carlos Rivas), had remarked that he took it from a dead Englishman. Hearing this Teresa is aghast. When the gypsy named Flaco (Walter Slezak) mentions that he had seen the girl at the convent, he laughingly says, \"A Christian gypsy - that's a joke.\" As the other gypsies also laugh, Teresa, now angry with God, denounces Christianity as a lie that deceives its believers. To make her point she rips off a necklace with a crucifix and throws it to the ground, screaming that she is no Christian.\n\nWhat Teresa doesn't know is that Michael has been captured and taken to a prison camp. After some time he escapes and returns to the convent to take Teresa with him to England to marry her. He's too late, the Mother Superior informs him, \"Teresa is now the Bride of Christ,\" meaning that she has taken her final vows and is now a fully professed nun. Michael pushes past her only to find \"Teresa\" in full habit - actually the Virgin Mary impersonating her - in a procession singing \"Ave Regina Coelarum\" (\"Hail, Queen of Heaven\"). Disillusioned, he leaves to return to duty.\n\nMeanwhile, Teresa, believing Michael dead, falls in love with Guido. The resentful Carlitos, is eaten up by envy and jealousy. On the eve of their wedding, Guido is betrayed to the French by Carlitos. A detachment of soldiers sweeps the gypsy camp pushing Carlitos before them to show them the way. The soldiers shoot a number of men, including Guido.\n\nAfter the French captain tosses a bag of gold to Carlitos, he is in turn shot to death by La Roca, the two men's mother (Katina Paxinou) for betraying his brother. In agony La Roca turns on the despondent Teresa as the cause of this disaster and banishes her from the camp. Flaco decides to act as Teresa's protector as they begin to wander Spain together.\n\nComing to Madrid, Teresa flirts with Cordoba (Gustavo Rojo), a bullfighter while being pursued by the wealthy Count Casimir (Dennis King) who finances her career as a singer. The bullfighter is gored in the bullring while smiling at her, deepening Teresa's belief that she the cause of his death as, she believes, she was for Michael and the two gypsy brothers, \"I'm bad luck to anyone who shows me any kindness or affection,\" as she once told Flaco. She also abandons the portrait Casimir had commissioned from \"my friend, Goya,\" leaving him in despair when he discovers her sudden departure.\n\nDuring the next four years Teresa travels the Continent becoming a celebrated singer. In Belgium on a concert tour, a special ball is being prepared for the British officers stationed there before they again meet the armies of Napoleon, now escaped from Elba. In her carriage, Teresa catches sight of a British colonel - it is Michael.\n\nThe two lovers attend the ball. On the terrace Teresa asks Michael why, after his escape, he did not come back for her. But he did, Michael tells her. In fact he is surprised to see her, considering that he had seen her in nun's habit after taking final vows. She persuades him that he must have hallucinated this while he was lying ill at the prison camp. Michael agrees. At the same time he does recall that the statue of the Madonna had disappeared. This news distresses Teresa even more; because she had so loved the statue. Just then word comes to Colonel Stuart that Michael's uncle, the Duke of Wellington, has called all officers to join their ranks. The ball had been allowed to go on as a ruse to fool all the spies infesting Belgium (this is an actual historical event). Michael asks Teresa to pray for him.\n\nTeresa has now come to a crossroad. Because she believes herself cursed she is terrified that Michael will die in battle for having loved her. She goes to a church to pray. There she makes her peace with God, asking Him to keep Michael safe so that he may return to his own people, and not to her. Leaving word with the parish priest, she decides to return to the convent and leaves with Flaco in a coach.\n\nThe next day, Michael leads the cavalry charge that finally breaks the ranks of Napoleon's soldiers. A cannonball explodes near him. Wellington sees Michael fall from his horse. Bodies litter the field but Michael comes to his senses. Picking up his helmet, he sees where shrapnel has torn a slice across it. It appears that Michael has been saved through divine intervention.\n\nMichael returns to Teresa's flat. She has sent the priest to tell him of her decision and to deliver a letter to him in which Teresa begs Michael not to follow her. She must return to her true vocation. In anguish Michael asks the priest for his spiritual guidance, knowing that he must respect Teresa's choice and do what is right by letting her go.\n\nBack in Salamanca Teresa finds the region suffering a drought \"for four years now,\" as a woman tells her - ever since the statue of Mary disappeared. Bidding farewell to Flaco, Teresa enters the chapel she'd left so long ago and prays. Weeping, she prostrates herself on the floor as the Blessed Virgin enters, pauses to bless her, and then returns to the pedestal that had been for so long vacant. When she looks up, Teresa finds the statue returned to its pedestal and gazes on it in awe.\n\nImmediately, a thunderstorm erupts, the drought is over. The joyous people of the town come to the chapel of the convent, including Flaco. As the nuns assemble for prayer, they are struck with the realization that the statue of the Virgin Mary is back in its place and Teresa is kneeling in front of it, properly habited, firmly in prayer. Everyone is struck by what is considered the miraculous reappearance of the statue and join in singing Mozart's beautiful motet, Ave verum corpus.\n\nThe movie was based on a play produced by Max Reinhardt, who staged it successfully in London (1911) and New York (1924). Warner Bros bought the film rights from Reinhardt in 1927. Various scripts were written over the years by Ulrich Steindorf, Wolfgang Reinhardt, and James Hilton, among others. The film was scheduled for filming in 1942, and was to have been presented in a four-hour version produced by Wolfgang Reinhardt, son of Max Reinhardt. However, the project was shelved until 1958, when a script from Frank Butler was announced as film-able. The movie was to be shot in the Cinemiracle process in association with National Theatres, but this did not happen.\n\nWhile the original play and film had been set in medieval times, this version was set during the Napoleonic era in Spain – its climax involved the Battle of Waterloo, with Torin Thatcher making a cameo appearance as Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (Napoleon is never seen in the film).\n\nFollowing her success in \"Baby Doll\", Carroll Baker turned down parts in \"God's Little Acre\" and \"Too Much, Too Soon\". Warner Bros put her under suspension for refusing the latter; she agreed to play \"The Miracle\" for the studio, in part because the role was \"sympathetic\" and similar to a \"feminine Faust\".\n\nIt is possible that Carroll Baker was selected to star in the production as a way for Warner Brothers to make peace with the Catholic Church in the United States and \"rehabilitate\" her reputation in the eyes of the Church. The Legion of Decency, a Catholic film review board, had denounced Baker's suggestive performance in \"Baby Doll\" four years earlier, placing that film on its \"Condemned\" list. Such a drastic classification had seldom been given to any domestic releases due to the strict enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code in the film industry. Francis Cardinal Spellman, then archbishop of New York, had even gone so far as to threaten excommunication to any Catholic going to see \"Baby Doll\". The film's poor box office reflected the Catholic boycott. \n\nRoger Moore was signed by Warner Bros to a long term contract.\nFilming took place between July and November 1958 in part on location at the Santa Susana Mountains.\n\n\"Our director was a humorless jerk,\" recalled Baker later. \"Roger [Moore] took so much abuse from Irving Rapper that I was appalled, but he took it like a man and went on to do a very professional job.\"\n\nRapper later said the \"main trouble\" on the film \"was casting. The girl who played the nun [Baker] was thrust on me without a test. I was furious. I was floored. The whole thing was unspeakably bad because of her. I didn't even talk to her.\" \n\n\"I was difficult,\" admitted Baker. \"I always wanted things my way. I wanted things to be artistically wonderful, and when I worked with a bad director when I did with \"The Miracle\", I was jumping all over him and saying, \"No, you can't do that\" and \"No, you're not going to have me do this.\" I was very difficult. He worked with Bette Davis and she was difficult, so I guess the studio thought he would be able to handle me. Obviously I was more difficult than Bette Davis.\"\n\nIt was Katrina Paxinou's first film in Hollywood since appearing in \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" 15 years earlier. \"All the people I know are gone,\" she said during filming. \"Where are they? The whole personality of Hollywood has changed. It's not colourful anymore; it's a dull neutral.\"\n\nNot presented as a pantomime but as a regular epic, the 1959 film was panned by critics, and had the misfortune to be released to theatres the same week as MGM's widescreen remake of \"Ben-Hur\" starring Charlton Heston – one of the most successful epic films of all time. Even worse, Warner Bros. had earlier that same year released \"The Nun's Story\", a film starring Audrey Hepburn in which the main character was also a nun having doubts about her vocation, as in \"The Miracle\". \"The Nun's Story\" had been a commercial and critical smash hit, gaining several Oscar nominations. Both that film and \"The Miracle\" were produced by Henry Blanke, and most likely, one drew unfavorable comparisons with the other. It was not released in Great Britain until December 26th, 1960, accompanied by a large advertising campaign for its ABC circuit release.\n\nCarroll Baker claims the film made money at the box office but says she disliked it so much she bought out her contract with Warner Bros. This cost her a considerable amount of money and she later wrote that she regretted the decision.\n\nThe film, which was originally shot in wide screen Technirama and Technicolor and projected with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio was issued on videocassette in a cropped 4 x 3 Pan and Scan transfer in 1997, appearing on DVD in a Korean subtitled version. Warner Archive have been intending to release a restored 2.35:1 wide screen DVD transfer of the film for some time, but their plans have been delayed due to technical problems with the original film elements.\n\n\n", "id": "7725128", "categories": ["1950s drama films", "Warner Bros. films", "American films based on plays", "Films scored by Elmer Bernstein", "Sound film remakes of silent films", "1959 films", "American films", "Films directed by Irving Rapper"], "title": "The Miracle (1959 film)"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7725171", "text": "RUNX2\n\nRunt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) also known as core-binding factor subunit alpha-1 (CBF-alpha-1) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the \"RUNX2\" gene. RUNX2 is a key transcription factor associated with osteoblast differentiation.\n\nIt has also been suggested that Runx2 plays a cell proliferation regulatory role in cell cycle entry and exit in osteoblasts, as well as endothelial cells. Runx2 suppresses pre-osteoblast proliferation by affecting cell cycle progression in the G1 phase. In osteoblasts, the levels of Runx2 is highest in G phase and is lowest in S, G, and M. The comprehensive cell cycle regulatory mechanisms that Runx2 may play are still unknown, although it is generally accepted that the varying activity and levels of Runx2 throughout the cell cycle contribute to cell cycle entry and exit, as well as cell cycle progression. These functions are especially important when discussing bone cancer, particularly osteosarcoma development, that can be attributed to aberrant cell proliferation control.\n\nThis protein is a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors and has a Runt DNA-binding domain. It is essential for osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis. It acts as a scaffold for nucleic acids and regulatory factors involved in skeletal gene expression. The protein can bind DNA both as a monomer or, with more affinity, as a subunit of a heterodimeric complex. Transcript variants of the gene that encode different protein isoforms result from the use of alternate promoters as well as alternate splicing.\n\nThe cellular dynamics of Runx2 protein are also important for proper osteoblast differentiation. Runx2 protein is detected in preosteoblasts and the expression is upregulated in immature osteoblasts and downregulated in mature osteoblasts. It is the first transcription factor required for determination of osteoblast commitment, followed by Sp7 and Wnt-signaling. Runx2 is responsible for inducing the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells into immature osteoblasts, as well as activating expression of several key downstream proteins that maintain osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix genes.\n\nKnock-out of the DNA-binding activity results in inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation. Because of this, Runx2 is often referred to as the master regulator of bone.\n\nIn addition to being the master regulator of osteoblast differentiation, Runx2 has also been shown to play several roles in cell cycle regulation. This is due, in part, to the fact that Runx2 interacts with many cellular proliferation genes on a transcription level, such as c-Myb and C/EBP, as well as p53/ These functions are critical for osteoblast proliferation and maintenance. This is often controlled via oscillating levels of Runx2 within throughout cell cycle due to regulated degradation and transcriptional activity.\n\nOscillating levels of Runx2 within the cell contribute to cell cycle dynamics. In the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell line, Runx2 levels are a maximum during G1 and a minimum during G2, S, and mitosis. In addition, the oscillations in Runx2 contribute to G1-related anti-proliferative function. It has also been proposed that decreasing levels of Runx2 leads to cell cycle exit for proliferating and differentiating osteoblasts, and that Runx2 plays a role in mediating the final stages of osteoblast via this mechanism. Current research posits that the levels of Runx2 serve various functions.\n\nIn addition, Runx2 has been shown to interact with several kinases that contribute to facilitate cell-cycle dependent dynamics via direct protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, Runx2 controls the gene expression of cyclin D2, D3, and the CDK inhibitor p21(cip1) in hematopoietic cells. It has been shown that on a molecular level, Runx associates with the cdc2 partner cyclin B1 during mitosis. The phosphorylation state of Runx2 also mediates it’s DNA-binding activity. The Runx2 DNA-binding activity is correlated with cellular proliferation, which suggests Runx2 phosphorylation may also be related to Runx2-mediated cellular proliferation and cell cycle control. To support this, it has been noted that Runx is phosphorylated at Ser451 by cdc2 kinase, which facilitates cell cycle progression through the regulation of G2 and M phases.\n\nMutations in Runx2 are associated with the disease Cleidocranial dysostosis. One study proposes that this phenotype arises partly due to the Runx2 dosage insufficiencies. Because Runx2 promotes exit from the cell cycle, insufficient amounts of Runx2 are related to increased proliferation of osteoblasts observed in patients with cleodocranial disostosis.\n\nVariants of Runx2 have been associated with the osteosarcoma phenotype. Current research suggests that this is partly due to the role of Runx2 in mitigating the cell cycle. Runx2 plays a role as a tumor suppressor of osteoblasts by halting cell cycle progression at G. Compared to normal osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1, the oscillations of Runx2 in osteosarcoma ROS and SaOS cell lines are aberrant when compared to the oscillations of Runx2 levels in normal osteoblasts, suggesting that deregulation of Runx2 levels may contribute to abnormal cell proliferation by an inability to escape the cell cycle. Molecularly, It has been proposed that proteasome inhibition by MG132 can stabilize Runx2 protein levels in late G and S in MC3T3 cells, but not in osteosarcoma cells which consequently leads to a cancerous phenotype.\n\nDue to its role as a master transcription factor of osteoblast differentiation, the regulation of Runx2 is intricately connected to other processes within the cell.\n\nTwist, Msh homeobox 2 (Msx2), and promyeloctic leukemia zinc-finger protein (PLZF) act upstream of Runx2. Osterix (Osx) acts downstream of Runx2 and serves as a marker for normal osteoblast differentiation. Zinc finger protein 521 (ZFP521) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) are cofactors of Runx2.\n\nFurthermore, in proliferating chondrocytes, Runx2 is inhibited by CyclinD1/CDK4 as part of the cell cycle.\n\nRUNX2 has been shown to interact with:\n\nmiR-133 and CyclinD1/CDK4 directly inhibits Runx2.\n\n\n", "id": "7725171", "categories": [], "title": "RUNX2"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7725180", "text": "(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story\n\n\"(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story\" is a popular song published in 1970, with music by Francis Lai and lyrics by Carl Sigman. The song was first introduced as an instrumental theme in the 1970 film \"Love Story\" after the film's distributor, Paramount Pictures, rejected the first set of lyrics that were written. Andy Williams eventually recorded the new lyrics and took the song to number nine on \"Billboard\" magazine's Hot 100 and number one on their Easy Listening chart.\n\nThe score for \"Love Story\" was written by Francis Lai, and the company that published the music for Paramount felt that the track heard over the opening and closing credits, which was titled \"Theme from Love Story\", needed lyrics. Michael Sigman, son of lyricist Carl Sigman, recalled that his father was asked to provide the words and received \"a synopsis of the script and the lead sheet of the music. The story was schmaltzy, but the music inspired words that expressed the sadness beneath the schmaltz.\" The initial set of lyrics his father wrote mirrored the storyline of the film from the prospective of the male protagonist, who describes a woman who enters his life (\"So Jenny came\") and then \"suddenly was gone.\" Paramount executive Robert Evans \"thought the lyric was a 'downer.' Further, he couldn’t abide the phrase 'Jenny came,' believing it too sexually suggestive for a mainstream audience. He demanded a rewrite,\" and this upset Carl. \"At first, justifiably proud of the fine lyric he crafted, he was angry and felt like refusing to do a rewrite. But the next day he cooled off and, pacing around his living room, said to his wife, 'Where do I begin?' and the new lyric was launched.\" \n\nBefore the film opened in theaters on December 25, 1970, the recording of \"Theme from Love Story\" by Henry Mancini was released as a single and made its debut on \"Billboard\"'s Easy Listening chart in the issue of the magazine dated December 19. Two versions of \"(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story\"—one by Williams and one by Tony Bennett—were released on January 15, 1971, and an article in the magazine's January 23 issue tried to explain the gap between releases of the instrumental and vocal versions as intentional. The logic behind the decision was that \"only the instrumental version should hit the market before the picture's release, and that the vocal version should be held up until several weeks after the film's release so that 'the theme and the image of \"Love Story\" would be implanted in the audience's mind.'\"\n\nThe Mancini version spent two of its 16 weeks on the Easy Listening chart at number two and also began a run of 11 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the January 16 issue, during which time it got as high as number 13. The track that Francis Lai and his orchestra recorded for the film first charted on the Hot 100 in the January 31 issue and made it to number 31 over the course of nine weeks. It also reached number 21 on the Easy Listening chart during its five weeks there that began in the February 6 issue.\n\nThe Williams version of \"(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story\" also debuted in the February 6 issue on both the Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts, while the Bennett version only managed to \"bubble under\" the Hot 100 for five weeks that began in the February 13 issue and eked out a peak position at number 114. Williams reached number nine on the Hot 100 during a 13-week stay and enjoyed four of his 15 weeks on the Easy Listening chart at number one. Roy Clark entered the Country singles chart with his rendition six weeks later, on March 27, and made it to number 74 during his two weeks there. (The flip side of Clark's single was his guitar rendition of the \"Theme from Love Story\"\nthat also appeared on his 1973 album \"Superpicker.\")\n\nIn the UK Williams began a run of 18 weeks on March 20 of that year that led to a number four showing. His competition on the UK singles chart came from Shirley Bassey, who debuted her rendition of the song on March 27 and made it to number 34 during her nine weeks there.\n\nA pop version of \"(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story\" by Nino Tempo & April Stevens went by the title \"Love Story\" and \"bubbled under\" the Hot 100 to number 113 during its three weeks on the chart in December 1972.\n\nThe song has been covered by many artists, including as an instrumental theme. The most notable are the versions by Andy Williams and Tony Bennett. In his AllMusic review of the 1971 Johnny Mathis album \"Love Story\", Joe Viglione wrote, \"His rendition of '(Where Do I Begin) Love Story' is riveting, a sweeping and majestic piece to lead off the record, and not the usual Jack Gold musical movement, but more pronounced and determined.\"\n\n\"Theme from Love Story\" also served as the theme of the 1973–74 NBC romantic anthology television series \"Love Story\".\n\nIn 1979 Williams acted as executive producer of a disco version of his original recording that was arranged, conducted and produced by Bob Esty.\n\nThe Mancini version was sampled in a 2001 song called \"Dance with the Devil\" by the rapper Immortal Technique.\n\n\n", "id": "7725180", "categories": ["Songs written by Carl Sigman", "1970 songs", "Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one singles", "Songs with music by Francis Lai", "Songs written for films", "Andy Williams songs", "Glen Campbell songs", "Shirley Bassey songs"], "title": "(Where Do I Begin?)

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7725185", "text": "PJ Maybe\n\nPhilip Janet Maybe is a fictional character in the \"2000 AD\" comic strip \"Judge Dredd\". He is a notorious serial killer, and most notably assumed the identity of Mayor Byron Ambrose, whom he murdered.\n\nThe only child of the Maybe family and a relative of the wealthy Yess family (a family of trouser makers), he was a child genius and serial killer. (His middle name is Janet because his parents wanted a girl.) He deliberately kept his high intelligence secret, by learning to spell badly and act stupidly, in order to avoid getting caught. He killed for the first time at age 12, by murdering a neighbourhood couple whom he chose at random from the phone book, as an experiment. He moved on to gradually killing members of the Yess family, setting things up so his father could assume control of the company. After being apprehended by Judge Dredd, he was sent to an asylum.\n\nDuring Necropolis, he escaped from the overrun asylum and fled back home (the Sisters of Death spotted him, patted his head, and told him \"goood boyyy\"). He witnessed his parents' suicide. Shortly afterward, he was contacted by a family friend, Mrs Urchison, who intend to let the Maybes take refuge in her family's bunker. He killed both her and her only child, and used the family's face changing machine to alter his appearance to impersonate her son. After inheriting the family fortune and killing several more associates, he was arrested by Dredd as he was escaping to Ciudad Barranquilla. By this time he had murdered 21 people before his eighteenth birthday.\n\nImprisoned for seven years in Iso-Block 666, he escaped again by drugging his psychiatrist and another patient with a mind-altering drug, to convince both of them that the hapless patient was in fact PJ Maybe. Using the Second Robot War as cover, he left the Iso-Block and attempted to change his face into that of billionaire Gunga Dinsdale. Tricked by a back street merchant (who disfigured him), he killed a street judge nearby and fled the city.\n\nOnce free, he stole the identity of Pedro Julio Montez and faked his own death. Maybe had his heart removed and replaced with an artificial one, the real heart being given to Judge Dredd as proof of death. The heart went on display in the Black Museum inside the Grand Hall of Justice. He later went back to Mega-City One to set up a lucrative business deal with the city - in reality a cover to kill six childhood tormentors for (correctly) accusing him at age 6 of attempting to injure them. After killing five of the six, he realised that Dredd may identify and protect the sixth, since Dredd had by now deduced that Maybe was still alive. He instead drugged a pilot and ordered him to crash into the sixth victim's apartment block, creating an inferno that killed twenty thousand citizens.\n\nShortly after his escape, several ambassadors from Mega City One came to Ciudad Barranquilla with Dredd guarding them - a cover for the Judge's secret attempts to locate him. Maybe was prepared for this, and murdered four ambassadors to taunt Dredd. He then kidnapped doctor and millionaire philanthropist Byron Ambrose and switched Ambrose's heart for an artificial one. After having his own DNA records swapped with those of Ambrose by drugged judges, he then tricked Dredd into believing he was dead by letting Ambrose die in a fire, to be identified as Maybe from the DNA and the heart, while Maybe assumed his identity. Maybe also had Ambrose's real heart swapped for his own in the Black Museum, and ordered the drugged judges to kill themselves, to avoid any possibility of his plans being discovered. He returned to Mega-City One, already planning more killings.\n\nUnfortunately the real Ambrose had been disowned by his wealthy Grandfather, who controlled the family fortune, and while Maybe was able to use the real Ambrose's reputation to gain influence in MC1 and be elected a councilor, the fortune he'd hope to obtain remained out of his reach.\n\nIn 2129 Maybe was elected Mayor of Mega-City One running for the illiberal party after killing the incumbent mayor, running as a candidate in the ensuing election, and framing his opponent for the murder (and a string of other murders). With Maybe now in a place of limited power, his murders led Dredd to suspect that once again Maybe has cheated death. By Christmas, he began killing for fun again (starting with the deputy mayor), though at the same time he proved to be a highly effective civic leader, even gaining Dredd's approval.\n\nIn early 2130, a biography of his life was published; Maybe planned to kill the author. A young boy named JP Buwick began emulating PJ Maybe's early killings after reading the biography (including signing the killings \"PJ Mabey\"), and Maybe became paranoid that his identity was known and he was being challenged. He tracked down Buwick but was beaten to the punch by Judge Beeny, who was investigating Buwick's murders. Instead he killed the biography author by the same method he had intended to kill Buwick with: drowning her in a PortaPool of jelly which was then allowed to set, and left for the judges to find.\n\nIn 2132 Chief Judge Sinfield ordered Maybe to raise more revenue for the city, and threatened to undermine his re-election campaign if he did not comply. Maybe did not take kindly to these threats, and resolved to murder Sinfield instead.\n\nTo Maybe's extreme fury, two attempts involving infecting the Chief Judge with horrible (and normally fatal) diseases failed to kill Sinfield, and even worse inspired a wave of other people to attack the Chief Judge. Adamant that only he could kill the Chief Judge, Maybe stepped up his efforts, eventually sending a robot (disguised as former chief judge Hershey) to kill Sinfield. However Dredd destroyed the robot and saved Sinfield. Maybe's DNA was found on the remains of the robot, and because it matched Ambrose's DNA record, Maybe was arrested. Maybe successfully stood up to interrogation, but his true identity was finally discovered when Dredd compared his DNA to an old sample of Maybe's DNA from an archived evidence file pertaining to his earliest murders. When that DNA sample was found to match Ambrose's DNA record, instead of Maybe's, the record switch was found out, and Maybe finally confessed and was subsequently sentenced to death. The people were never informed of Ambrose's true identity, and they were told that the mayor had died of natural causes. Maybe later informed Dredd of his suspicions about Sinfield's drugging of Judge Francisco and helped him uncover the truth. As a result, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, although Dredd stated that he personally voted for Maybe to be executed.\n\nMaybe escaped the following year. Over the next few months he managed to marry a wealthy but old woman and also executed a daring plan to murder his successor as head of the Illiberal Party (and leading candidate to replace Maybe as Mayor), as well as other candidates in the election. This occurred under the very noses of the Judges, though Dredd was lenient in their criticism, recalling the number of times Maybe had eluded him as well.\n\nDuring the events of \"Day of Chaos\", PJ had to defend his wife's house from constant raids. When three of the Dark Judges turned up, Maybe managed to trick them into underestimating him and then trapped them in a wine bottle. They were rescued by Judge Death, who killed Maybe's wife. Maybe escaped by simply running one way when Death looked the other.\n\nSeveral months later he began writing to Dredd, informing him of his belief that several different serial killers were in fact one person. This turned out to be correct and the offender was captured and executed thanks to some of his hints. Maybe though managed to elude capture and even framed another citizen into confessing he was Maybe, but Dredd's intuition prevented the man's execution.\n\nSome time later Maybe was once again in the spot light when the Judges began an appeal for information on him. A seriously ill man came forward claiming Maybe had been his lover and had poisoned him when he became aware of his true identity. Maybe was now transgender and dating and sleeping with men as a disguise (an extent that even surprised Dredd). When the Judges began closing in, he attempted to kidnap Dredd's niece Vienna, but suspecting this, Dredd had replaced her with an undercover Judge. Eventually cornered on a ledge he attempted to blow up himself and Dredd with a grenade, but was shot, fell over the edge and then blown to pieces by the grenade detonating.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7725185", "categories": ["Judge Dredd characters", "Fictional serial killers", "Fictional shapeshifters"], "title": "PJ Maybe"}

The village and the manor house are mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 - with the entry reading: \"Malpertesselle/Maperteshale: Gilbert FitzSolomon.\"\n\nThe Manor House belonged to the De Meppershall family for nearly 300 years following 1086; however, the present house is early 17th century.\n\nUntil 1844 Meppershall was partially in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. The detached portion of Hertfordshire was transferred to Bedfordshire in 1844, following the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844.\n\nSt. Mary's church dates back to the Normans. The Parish Records of St Mary, Meppershall, have been published on CD by the Parochial Church Council.\n\nBefore the advent of greenhouses, Meppershall was a very poor community with large families living in two up, two down type thatched cottages built of brick with stone floors. However so many greenhouses were built in the village that it was known as \"glass city\" growing salad crops for local markets and shipped further afield via the railway. \n\nAs well as farming the village earned its income from coprolite digging. Coprolite is the fossilised dung of pre-historic creatures, which when ground and treated with sulphuric acid produces a superphosphate fertiliser. To extract it a long trench was dug on one side of a field. The overlaying clay was then dug out until the nodule bed was reached. If the depth of clay to be removed was more than eight to nine feet, the trench was made in two or three steps and as the nodules were taken out, so the trench was re-filled with the earth already removed. The nodule bed was shovelled into barrows and taken to the washing mill. This consisted of a circular iron trough with a pivot in the centre to which a set of travelling rakes was attached, these being dragged round by horses and a constant stream of water was kept running through the trough until the clay washed off. The dirty water then was drained off and the nodules carted away. The coprolite was worth about £3 a ton in 1890, yielding some 300 tons per acre. A good fossil digger could earn as much as £2 a week. This industry has also died out.\n\n", "id": "7725227", "categories": ["Civil parishes in Bedfordshire", "Villages in Bedfordshire"], "title": "Meppershall"}

It was originally developed for food canning and has found applications in cosmetics, producing salmonella-free feeds for animals (e.g. poultry) and pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn 1895, William Lyman Underwood of the Underwood Canning Company, a food company founded in 1822 at Boston, Massachusetts and later relocated to Watertown, Massachusetts, approached William Thompson Sedgwick, chair of the biology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, about losses his company was suffering due to swollen and burst cans despite the newest retort technology available. Sedgwick gave his assistant, Samuel Cate Prescott, a detailed assignment on what needed to be done. Prescott and Underwood worked on the problem every afternoon from late 1895 to late 1896, focusing on canned clams. They first discovered that the clams contained heat-resistant bacterial spores that were able to survive the processing; then that these spores' presence depended on the clams' living environment; and finally that these spores would be killed if processed at 250 ˚F (121 ˚C) for ten minutes in a retort.\n\nThese studies prompted the similar research of canned lobster, sardines, peas, tomatoes, corn, and spinach. Prescott and Underwood's work was first published in late 1896, with further papers appearing from 1897 to 1926. This research, though important to the growth of food technology, was never patented. It would pave the way for thermal death time research that was pioneered by Bigelow and C. Olin Ball from 1921 to 1936 at the National Canners Association (NCA).\n\nBigelow and Ball's research focused on the thermal death time of \"Clostridium botulinum\" (\"C. botulinum\") that was determined in the early 1920s. Research continued with inoculated canning pack studies that were published by the NCA in 1968.\n\nThermal death time can be determined one of two ways: 1) by using graphs or 2) by using mathematical formulas.\n\nThis is usually expressed in minutes at the temperature of . This is designated as \"F\". Each 18 °F or 10 °C change results in a time change by a factor of 10. This would be shown either as F = 10 minutes (Celsius) or F = 10 minutes (Fahrenheit).\n\nA lethal ratio (\"L\") is also a sterilizing effect at 1 minute at other temperatures with (\"T\").\n\nwhere \"T\" is the reference temperature, usually ; \"z\" is the z-value, and \"T\" is the slowest heat point of the product temperature.\n\nPrior to the advent of computers, this was plotted on semilogarithmic paper though it can also be done on spreadsheet programs. The time would be shown on the x-axis while the temperature would be shown on the \"y\"-axis. This simple heating curve can also determine the lag factor (\"j\") and the slope (\"f\"). It also measures the product temperature rather than the can temperature. \n\nwhere \"I\" = RT (Retort Temperature) − IT (Initial Temperature) and where \"j\" is constant for a given product.\n\nIt is also determined in the equation shown below:\n\nwhere \"g\" is the number of degrees below the retort temperature on a simple heating curve at the end of the heating period, \"B\" is the time in minutes from the beginning of the process to the end of the heating period, and \"f\" is the time in minutes required for the straight-line portion of the heating curve plotted semilogarithmically on paper or a computer spreadsheet to pass through a log cycle.\n\nA broken heating curve is also used in this method when dealing with different products in the same process such as chicken noodle soup in having to dealing with the meat and the noodles having different cooking times as an example. It is more complex than the simple heating curve for processing.\n\nIn the food industry, it is important to reduce the amount of microbes in products to ensure proper food safety. This is usually done by thermal processing and finding ways to reduce the number of bacteria in the product. Time-temperature measurements of bacterial reduction is determined by a D-value, meaning how long it would take to reduce the bacterial population by 90% or one log at a given temperature. This D-value reference (D) point is .\n\n\"z\" or z-value is used to determine the time values with different \"D\"-values at different temperatures with its equation shown below:\n\nwhere \"T\" is temperature in °F or °C.\n\nThis \"D\"-value is affected by pH of the product where low pH has faster \"D\" values on various foods. The \"D\"-value at an unknown temperature can be calculated knowing the \"D\"-value at a given temperature provided the \"Z\"-value is known. \n\nThe target of reduction in canning is the 12-\"D\" reduction of \"C. botulinum,\" which means that processing time will reduce the amount of this bacteria by a factor of 10. The D for \"C. botulinum\" is 0.21 minute (12.6 seconds). A 12-D reduction will take 2.52 minutes (151 seconds).\n\nThis is taught in university courses in food science and microbiology and is applicable to cosmetic and pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\nIn 2001, the Purdue University Computer Integrated Food Manufacturing Center and Pilot Plant put Ball's formula online for use.\n\n", "id": "7725229", "categories": ["Food science"], "title": "Thermal death time"}
