Recorded at DEP International Studios in Birmingham with producer Dan Sprigg, it was originally released in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2006 by Visible Noise. The album was later issued by Earache Records in the United States on 14 August 2007. \"Count Your Blessings\" was supported by the release of music videos for two of the album's tracks: \"Pray for Plagues\" on 4 June 2007 and \"For Stevie Wonder's Eyes Only (Braille)\" on 6 March 2008.\n\nNamed after a lyric in the album's opening song \"Pray for Plagues\", \"Count Your Blessings\" is representative of the band's early deathcore sound, which was phased out on later releases and eventually abandoned in favour of other, less aggressive styles. The band members were young when they recorded the album, and both the band and its fans have largely disregarded it later in their career as inferior to their later material; it began as early as 2008, when guitarist Lee Malia was already criticising the album's quality. Most of the songs on the record quickly faded from the band's live setlists. Most band members recorded their parts individually, rather than the group doing so as a whole, with the central location of the studio blamed for distracting the young musicians. The album received some negative reviews, with the main complaints revolving around musical originality, although it still reached number 93 of the UK Albums Chart.\n\nFollowing the release of their first extended play \"This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For\" in October 2004, Bring Me the Horizon toured extensively while writing new material for their full-length debut album. Due to the number of shows the band were playing at the time, much of the material was written quickly before recording was due to begin – drummer Matt Nicholls claimed that three songs were written in the space of two days due to the upcoming deadline. A number of songs are re-recordings of early demos that the band had taped for a project titled \"The Bedroom Sessions\" and in a broadcast session for the UK station Radio 1, namely \"(I Used to Make Out With) Medusa\", \"Off the Heezay\" and \"Liquor & Love Lost\" (then known as \"Dragon Slaying\").\n\nRecording took place at DEP International Studios in Birmingham with producer Dan Sprigg, who had previously worked with bands including Cradle of Filth, Napalm Death and, more recently, Lostprophets. Frontman Oliver Sykes described the recording process as \"an intense experience\" due to the group's desire to make the best debut album they could, with biographer Ben Welch claiming that they \"were starting to feel the pressure of all of the hype that was building around them\" at the time. Due to the studio's location in the centre of the city, the young band members (all under 20 years old at the time) were often distracted and would not spend a lot of time in the studio; this meant that each individual member ended up recording the majority of their contributions to the album alone, rather than the full unit performing together.\n\nWhen recording \"Count Your Blessings\", Bring Me the Horizon intended to make an album which sounded \"as heavy and brutal as they possibly could\"; Welch claims that the band scrapped any song ideas that \"didn't fit that criterion\". Speaking in 2014 about the band's intentions when writing and recording music during their early years, Sykes claimed the group \"just wanted to make noisy music\". Similarly, when asked about the band's beginnings in a 2014 interview, guitarist Lee Malia explained, \"When you're young, you just want to do everything to extremes. That's what the first EP and the album were like: too over-excited sounding\". Matt Nicholls said that on \"Count Your Blessings\", Bring Me the Horizon \"were influenced a lot by Swedish metal – At The Gates and stuff like that.\" Nicholls also said that on \"Count Your Blessings\", Bring Me the Horizon's members \"were 18 or 19 years old and wanted to be as metal as possible.\" Specifically, the band's members were influenced by Norma Jean, Skycamefalling, Metallica, Pantera, At the Gates, Arch Enemy, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and In Flames at the band's beginning.\n\nThe musical style of \"Count Your Blessings\" is most often categorised as deathcore, but has also been labeled more generally as metalcore. In addition to metalcore, \"Count Your Blessings\" uses elements of genres like melodic death metal, death metal and black metal, drawing comparisons to bands like The Black Dahlia Murder, Cannibal Corpse, At the Gates, and Obituary. \"Last Rites\" compared the album's vocals (which consist of death growls and high-pitched shrieks) to black metal and the album's guitar playing to Gothenburg melodic death metal. According to \"Drowned in Sound\" columnist Raziq Rauf, the songs on the album \"generally consist of The Black Dahlia Murder-style thunderous riffs mixed with some dastardly sludgy doom moments and more breakdowns than your dad's old Nissan Sunny\". The lyrical content is admittedly simple, which according to Sykes is due to the fact that his life had \"never been that bad\" at the time he wrote them; the singer has noted that most songs on the album are \"about girls or just growing up\", which he claims contributes to the group's brand of \"party music\".\n\n\"Count Your Blessings\" was originally released in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2006 by Visible Noise. It was not released in the United States until 14 August 2007, when it was issued by Earache Records. The version released by retailer Hot Topic featured a cover version of Slipknot's \"Eyeless\" as a bonus track, which had originally been recorded for \"Higher Voltage: Another Brief History of Rock\", a CD released for free with an issue of \"Kerrang!\" magazine in June 2007. A first music video for \"Pray for Plagues\", was directed by Kenny Lindström and released on 4 June 2007. A second music video, directed by Perrone Salvatore, \"For Stevie Wonder's Eyes Only (Braille)\" was issued on 6 March 2008.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Count Your Blessings\", Bring Me the Horizon toured extensively in support of the album. Throughout October and November the group toured the UK with American black metal band Abigail Williams, although the Phoenix, Arizona-based band left the tour early on after drummer Zach Gibson suffered a wrist injury. Centurion replaced Abigail Williams for the remainder of the tour, and Bring Me the Horizon spent the rest of the year supporting labelmates Lostprophets. The band later replaced Bury Your Dead supporting Killswitch Engage on their European tour in January 2007, then continued to tour the UK through March and April. During the summer, the band played a number of festivals (including Download Festival).\n\nUpon its release, \"Count Your Blessings\" debuted at number 93 on the UK Albums Chart. It also peaked at number 9 on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart and remained there for two further weeks, first dropping to number 14 and then to number 26.\n\nMost of the media response to \"Count Your Blessings\" was mixed to negative. \"Exclaim!\" writer Bill Whish wrote positively about the release, praising the \"vitriolic lyrics and brutally heavy guitar work\" and welcoming the band as \"a little more interesting\" than some other metalcore artists. \"DIY\" magazine's Tom Connick dubbed \"(I Used to Make Out With) Medusa\" the \"crowning jewel\" of \"Count Your Blessings\" in a 2014 feature, claiming that it \"Perfectly [captures] that youthful, drunken recklessness that defined [the band's] most controversial years\" with its \"razor sharp\" guitar work and \"thunderous breakdowns\". Aaron McKay, a writer for \"Chronicles of Chaos\", praised Sykes' vocal delivery, likening it to Obituary frontman John Tardy. \n\nHowever, many commentators criticised the lack of invention on the album. While AllMusic's Stewart Mason praised the album for being \"vaguely interesting musically\" as well as claiming that there is \"a greater sense of dynamic than usual\" in the genre on the release, he also commented on the \"generally unimaginative songwriting\", claiming it adds \"little to the existing knowledge base\" of the genre. Furthermore, he also criticised Sykes's vocal style on the record, which he described as an \"immediately irritating\" and a \"high-pitched gibber\". Chad Bowar for About.com highlighted the band within their scene, praising their \"catchy melodies\" and \"decent riffs and solos\", and on \"Count Your Blessings\" welcomed the variety in styles of vocal delivery across the collection. However, similarly to Mason, Bowar dubbed the album \"way too generic and repetitive\", claiming that it features \"too many breakdowns\" and a majority of \"extremely forgettable\" songs. Axl Rosenberg of MetalSucks complained that the band displayed \"nothing to distinguish them from the pack\" on the album, although he did praise the presence of \"some decent breakdowns\" and claim that the songs would make \"good background noise\".\n\nDue to the young age of the band when they recorded the album and the drastic stylistic changes which followed its release, \"Count Your Blessings\" has largely been neglected in recent years, both by the band and by their fans. As early as 2008, guitarist Lee Malia was criticising the album's quality and noting that the band quickly wanted \"to do something better\" after its release. Following the release of \"Drown\" in 2014, described by \"Digital Spy\"s Adam Silverstein as \"a universe away from the ... full-on commotion\" of \"Count Your Blessings\", Sykes reflected that the single would have \"offended\" the band members when they were younger, adding that the group were \"never gonna sound like that again\".\n\nKeyboardist Jordan Fish (who joined Bring Me the Horizon about 6 years after the album's release) has explained the drastic evolution in style between \"Count Your Blessings\" and later releases as simply being due to the fact that the band members \"don't listen to deathcore anymore\", claiming that to attempt that type of music would be dishonest due to the members' change in tastes and feelings. \"Alternative Press\" writer Tyler Sharp has added that \"The members of Bring Me the Horizon have evolved from teenage metalheads to a group of mature, progressed songwriters\" in response to criticism of their change in style. Most of the album's songs were dropped from live performances in the years following the release of \"Suicide Season\" and \"There Is a Hell...\", although \"Pray for Plagues\" returned to set lists briefly in late 2014 when the band performed with original guitarist Curtis Ward at a few shows. The song is featured on the video album \"Live at Wembley\", recorded in December 2014.\n\nDespite the radical evolution of the band since \"Count Your Blessings\", the album has still received some retrospective praise. In a feature published in 2015, \"Kerrang!\" writer Emily Carter credited the album for increasing the popularity of the band during their formative years, as well as praising its guitar riffs and the song \"Pray for Plagues\". AXS contributor Rey Harris described the album as \"a classic among deathcore fans\", highlighting \"Black & Blue\" in particular. Sarai C. of Loudwire named \"Pray for Plagues\" the fourth best Bring Me the Horizon song to date (as of May 2014), praising it as \"one of Bring Me the Horizon's most timeless tracks\". Dan Slessor for \"Alternative Press\" included \"Tell Slater Not to Wash His Dick\" as the alternative tenth choice in his feature of \"The 10 best Bring Me the Horizon songs\", praising its \"exuberant energy and rich melody\".\n\nAll lyrics written by Oliver Sykes; all songs produced by Bring Me the Horizon and Dan Sprigg.\n\nBring Me the Horizon\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Count Your Blessings\", Visible Noise\n\n", "id": "7710636", "categories": ["2007 debut albums", "Bring Me the Horizon albums", "Deathcore albums"], "title": "Count Your Blessings (Bring Me the Horizon album)"}

Born in Lincolnshire, England, he emigrated to the United States as a young man after being ordained as a Methodist minister.\n\nHe served in parishes in Nevada and Southern California, gradually beginning his journalism and writing career. An editor of two magazines, he also wrote more than 40 books and many articles and pamphlets on California and the American Southwest.\n\nGeorge Wharton James was born in Lincolnshire, England. He married and was ordained as a Methodist minister. He and his wife immigrated to the United States in 1881.\n\nHe served in parishes in Nevada and southern California. However, in 1889 his wife sued for divorce, accusing him of committing numerous acts of adultery. He was tried by the Methodist Church, charged with real estate fraud, using faked credentials, and sexual misconduct. He was defrocked, although he was later reinstated.\n\nIn addition to writing his own books, James was associate editor of \"The Craftsman\" (1904–05), and editor of \"Out West\" (1912–14). In the style of the times, he was a popular lecturer in the region. He also lectured at both the Panama-Pacific and Panama-California expositions 1915–16.\n\nJames had a long-running feud with Charles Fletcher Lummis, a California writer with similar regional interests. Both men also explored the American Southwest, becoming acquainted with Father Anton Docher, a French-born missionary priest who served at Pueblo of Isleta in New Mexico for 34 years.\n\nJames' books included the well-received \"The Wonders of the Colorado Desert\" (1906), \"Through Ramona's Country\" (1909), \"In and Out of the Old Missions of California\" (1905), and \"The Lake of the Sky\" (1915). Characteristics of his writing included romanticism, an enthusiasm for natural environments, idealization of aboriginal lifeways, and promotion of health fads.\n\nAfter his divorce, James married again, living in Pasadena, California with his second wife at 1098 North Raymond Avenue. Writer Lawrence Clark Powell later described James' home as serving as \"a kind of museum salon in the same way that El Alisal served as the center for his rival booster Lummis' Los Angeles followers. He founded the Pasadena Browning Society, and the Anti-Whispering Society. According to Powell, the Anti-Whispering Society was \"devoted to the suppression of (1) talking audiences, (2) peanut fiends, and (3) crying babies.\"\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7710657", "categories": ["American travel writers", "1858 births", "American male non-fiction writers", "American nature writers", "Writers from California", "American non-fiction outdoors writers"], "title": "George Wharton James"}

He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1954 and a Royal Academician (RA) in 1963.\n\nBorn in Woolwich, England, Aldridge grew up in a comparatively wealthy military family. After attending Uppingham School in Rutland, Aldridge studied ‘Greats’ at Corpus Christi College at Oxford University and graduated in 1928 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. After finishing university, Aldridge settled in London, taught himself to paint and held his first mixed exhibition in 1931.\n\nAldridge exhibited with the 'Seven and Five Society' at the Leicester Galleries from 1931 to 1933. In 1933, he presented his first one man-show at the Leicester Galleries in London and in 1934 he exhibited at the Venice Biennale art exhibition in Italy. During this period and for the rest of his life, Aldridge associated with the British poet Robert Graves and the poets and artists centred on him in the village of Deià, Mallorca. In 1933, at age 28, Aldridge, and his cats, moved to Great Bardfield in the Essex countryside and acquired 'Place House'. He quickly became a friend of his neighbour, Edward Bawden, himself a painter. The two artists collaborated in designing ‘Bardfield’ wallpapers during the later 1930s, which were distributed by Cole & Sons, a British wallpaper company. In 1941, Aldridge joined the British Intelligence Corps as an officer interpreting aerial photographs. After leaving the army in 1945, Aldridge returned to landscape painting. Although he was a skilled 'plein air' painter, many works were produced in his studio at his home; his subjects were the Essex countryside, scenes from his many visits to Italy and to Mallorca, and his much-loved garden at Place House.\n\nStarting in 1949, Aldridge taught at the Slade School for Fine Arts of University College London, under the realist painter Sir William Coldstream. At the same time, other artists started moving to Great Bardfield, making the village a dynamic centre for the visual arts. Aldridge and his wife Lucie Aldridge (née Brown) frequently opened Place House for summer exhibitions in the village. These well-organised shows attracted thousands of art lovers. In 1955, Aldridge told a London Observer reporter that \"“people seem to prefer this domestic informality to galleries”\". At these summer exhibitions, Aldridge exhibited his oils while Lucy exhibited her hand-knitted rugs. Although Aldridge's work was well-received, it seemed the most conservative of the Great Bardfield Artists as it possibly reflected the art scene of the 1920s and 1930s in Britain.\n\nThe early 1960s saw the Bardfield art community fragment but Aldridge would remain in Place House until his death. After his 1970 divorce, Aldridge married Gretl Cameron, the widow of his poet friend Norman Cameron. In 1980, on Aldridge's 75th birthday, London's New Grafton Gallery held a retrospective on his work. He died in 1983, his wife Gretl having deceased a few months earlier.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7710696", "categories": ["People from Woolwich", "Royal Academicians", "20th-century English painters", "People educated at Uppingham School", "English male painters", "English designers", "1905 births", "Alumni of Corpus Christi College, Oxford", "1983 deaths"], "title": "John Aldridge (artist)"}

It was originally used as a poorhouse and is the oldest surviving building built for housing the poor in Connecticut, as well as one of the oldest such in the United States. One of the largest structures of the Federal period in Middletown, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\n\nThe Town of Middletown built the Alms House in 1814 to house the town's poor. Many of the people housed there were required to work, either in the Alms House or in a local industrial business.\n\nThe building at 53 Warwick Street served as a poorhouse until 1853, when the institution was moved to the Middletown Town Farms facility on Silver Street in the town's South Farms district.\n\nShortly after, the Hubbard and Curtis Hardware Company occupied the building. This company, which manufactured tools, hardware, and wood-burning stoves, had its principal place of commerce on Main Street (359 Main Street) and manufactured its goods in this building. In the early 20th century, Fred I. Hodge, Sr. owned the Middletown Fire Arms and Specialty which manufactured valve wheels and guns. The Middletown Rifle Club had a rifle range in the basement and Hodge also repaired automobiles there. By 1981, C.B. Stone Inc., a home heating oil dealer, had occupied the building since the early 1930s. It is currently used for offices.\n\nThe three-and-a-half-story building is constructed in the Federal style and made of brick with Flemish bond and a brownstone foundation with an asphalt shingle roof. The architect and builder are unknown. A graphic depiction on an 1825 map indicates that the building was originally embellished by a segmental arch over the entrance door and a classical cupola. A central, slightly projecting, pavilion is still discernible. The building has a structural system of load-bearing masonry with a gable roof.\n\nLocated to the north on the premises, facing Warwick Street, is a late-Victorian brick residence. This substantial structure, once owned by Mayor Leo B. Santangelo, displays intricate stickwork on the veranda, and decorative brickwork, and is in relatively original condition. The southeast section of this structure is supported by large brownstone blocks. These blocks are the remains of a jail which was built on the Alms House grounds in 1846. It was a small facility, containing only twelve cells, with the principal jail being in Haddam.\n\nThis structure, which faces north, sits on a lot on the south side of residential Warwick Street. It is set back from the road behind two late-19th-century houses. A large oak tree to the west shades it.\n\n\nMiddletown, Connecticut Historical and Architectural Resources.

He also accompanied Khomeini in the exile period in both Iraq and France. He cofounded an armed group in the 1970s with Mohammad Montazeri, son of Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, in Lebanon and Syria, aiming at assisting liberation movements in Muslim countries.\n\nFollowing the revolution he served as Iran's ambassador to Syria from 1982 to 1986. He later became Iran's minister of interior. While ambassador to Syria, he is thought to have played a \"pivotal role\" in the creation of the Lebanese radical Shia organization Hezbollah, working \"within the framework of the Department for Islamic Liberation Movements run by the Iranian Pasdaran.\" Mohtashami \"actively supervised\" Hezbollah's creation, merging into it existing radical Shi'ite movements: the Lebanese al-Dawa; the Association of Muslim Students; Al Amal al Islamiyya. In 1986 his \"close supervision\" of Hezbollah was cut short when the Office of Islamic Liberation was reassigned to Iran's ministry of foreign affairs. He is also described as making \"liberal\" use of the diplomatic pouch as Ambassador, bringing in \"crates\" of material from Iran.\nHe was remained among radical hard line parties even when he choose as the minister in the government of Musavi.\n\nIn 1989 the new Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ousted Mohtashami from the Lebanon desk of the Iranian ministry of foreign affairs, replacing him with Rafsanjani's brother Mahmud Hashemi. This was seen as an indication of Iran's downgrading of its support for Hezbollah and for a revolutionary foreign policy in general.\n\nIn August 1991 he regained some of his influence when he became chairman of the defense committee of the Majlis (parliament) of Iran.\n\nMore controversially, Mohtashami is thought\nto have played an active role, with the Pasdaran and Syrian military intelligence, in the supervision of Hezbollah's suicide bomb attacks against the American embassy in Beirut in April 1983, the American and French contingents of the MNF in October 1983 and the American embassy annex in September 1984.\n\nand to have been instrumental in the killing of Lt.

The killing of Higgins is said to have come \"from orders issued by Iranian radicals, most notably Mohtashemi,\" in an effort to prevent \"improvement in the U.S.–Iranian relationship.\"\n\nWhile Mohtashami was a strong opponent of Western influence in the Muslim world and of the existence of the state of Israel, he was also a supporter and advisor of reformist Iranian president Mohammad Khatami who was famous for championing of free expression and civil rights. Mohtashemi was in the Western news again in 2000, not as a hardline radical but for refusing to appear in court in Iran after his pro-reform newspaper, \"Bayan\", was banned.\n\nBehzad Nabavi and Ali Akbar Mohtashami were among those who prevented by the Guardian council from taking part in the elections of Majlis.\n\nIn 1984, after the Beirut bombings, Mohtashami received a parcel containing a book on Shia holy places when he was serving as Iranian ambassador to Damascus.

He aided Mughal Emperor Humayun in his reconquest of the Subcontinent. He is considered a folk hero of the Baloch people and an important figure in the Baloch epic \"Hani and Sheh Mureed.\"\n\nMirjat : Chakar Rind lived near Sibi and became the head of Rind tribe at the age of 18 after the death of his father Mir Shahak Khan Rind. Mirjat Chakar's fiefdom was short-lived because of a civil war between the Lashari and Rind tribes of Balochistan. Mir Chakar Rind, head of the Rind tribe, went to war, which resulted in thousands dead. The war and the gallantry of the two tribe leaders continues to be a part of the Baloch peoples' history. After the \"Thirty Years' War\" against the Lashari Tribe. Mir Chakar Rind defeated the Lasharis.\nMir Chakar was a very brave man who desired to make the Baloch nation powerful. \nWhen Mir Chakar left Sibi, his next stop was Sanghar Desert. He ruled the Sanghar area for many years. No one could defeat Mir Chakar and his army until Mir Doda Khan arrived with his army. Although Mir Chakar had defeated Mir Doda once before, Mir Doda was badly frozen.\nMir Doda Khan defeated Mir Chakar in the desert of Sanghar, after which Mir Chakar and his army left Sanghar and moved to the Multan area where he shook hands with the Multan king. On the other side, Shehmureed had gone to Saudi Arabia. After Sheh Mureed, one of his best fighters was Mir Malagh Khan Rind.\n\nIt is said that Mir Malagh Khan's sword weighed . No one but Mir Malagh could handle it. \nMir Qaiser Khan, Mir Sanjar Khan and Mir Mandar Khan were some of Mir Chakar's best fighters. \nMir Chakar and the Multan king then planned to conquer Delhi, in India. The Multan king asked for Mir Chakar's help, and he gave him his best fighters. The Lashkar was led by Mir Malagh Khan and Mir Qaiser Khan, who went and they conquered Delhi. \nAfter this, the Delhi king purportedly said, \"There was not a single nail uncovered of the Baloch. Their head could reach the glaring sun. They were united; they were brave!\" \nOn the other side, Mir Doda was gaining power. His grandsons Mir Ghazi khan and Mir Ismail khan were his best fighters. The Dera Ghazi Khan and Dera Ismail Khan district of Pakistan are named after these two. \nThe Multan king invited Mir Doda to dinner. When Mir Doda came, the Multan king said that from then on he would be his left hand. \nMir Chakar became angry and planned to attack Mir Doda. In the battle, Mir Doda was badly defeated and his people and army moved to Sindh and never came back.\n\nNear the desert of Sanghar he built 100 houses for his relatives to live in, and he named the place Sowkar (also written Sokar). This place is still located near the Sanghar desert in Tehsil Taunsa, Dera Ghazi Khan District.\nMir Malagh Khan also lived there as he was the best fighter of Mir Chakar. Malghani Balochs are the descendants of this great man. Now Sokar is the hometown of Malghani Baloch Tribe.\n\nMir Chakar then settled in Satghara and gained power and respect in the area. Sher Shah Suri sent a message to Mir Chakar to unite with him and consolidate his gains. Mir Chakar appreciated the offer but refused to help Sher Shah Suri. Under the command of his son, Mir Shahdad Khan, his forces instead joined the Mughal army of Emperor Humayun in 1555 after a long exile in Persia. Emperor Humayun came back, recaptured Delhi, and ousted the Suri dynasty in 1556. As a reward, Emperor Humayun conferred a vast Jagir, including horses and slaves, to Mir Chakar.

The street and market are named for Albert Cuyp, a painter from the 17th century.\n\nThe market began as an ad hoc collection of street traders and pushcarts. By the beginning of the 20th century, this had become so chaotic that in 1905, the city government decided to set up a market, at first only held on Saturday evenings. In 1912, the market became a daytime market open six days a week. Originally the street was accessible while the market was taking place, but more recently the street has been completely closed off to traffic during market hours.\n\nThe product selection at the market varies from the traditional range of vegetables, fruit and fish to clothing and even cameras. There are many products sold that are of interest to the city's residents of Surinamese, Antillean, Turkish, and Moroccan origin, giving the market and neighbourhood a strong multicultural feel.\n\nThe market is the busiest in all of the Netherlands and is reputedly the largest daytime market in Europe. It is also an important tourist attraction. The famous Dutch Stroopwafels are prepared fresh here. \n\nAlso popular are the many ethnic restaurants and bars that are found behind the market stalls.\n\n\n\n\"100 Jaar Albert Cuyp Markt\", Marcella van der Weg en Maria Douwes.

Also in 1998, Canarie funded a project titled \"Distributed Interactive Virtual Environment (DIVE) over CA*net II\", with three partners, the universities of\nOttawa and Western Ontario, and\nCRC Canada. FreeWRL was used by CRC in this project, as it ran on their platform of choice, Linux, and supported VRML additions (the EAI protocol) that allowed control of a VRML scene from outside entities.\n\nAt the end of the DIVE project, CRC took the knowledge gained from it, and combined this knowledge with other on-going projects (European Commission funded projects of Meccano, MERCI and MICE ) and created a form of conferencing by designing a distributed multicast enabled virtual world with position-dependent audio capabilities. This project, MVIP , and the follow on, MVIP-II , leveraged VRML and Multicast to enable interaction in shared worlds where participants were physically distant, by removing both high bitrate applications (video) and \"time sinks\" (client-server interaction) to best give the participants the feeling of being in a shared space.\n\nMVIP and MVIP source is available , and papers describing MVIP can be found on acm.org here and\nhere.\n\nMVIP-II tests were conducted between Ottawa, Canada, and Denmark, and between Ottawa, and Hawaii.\n\nCRC, with the valued support of Open Source contributors, continued to develop FreeWRL during the MVIP and MVIP-II projects. CRC co-sponsored the Web3D Consortium's\nSoftware Development Kit, and chaired the Web3D Consortium's Conformance Working Group, giving both industry and the public a common set of functionality to strive for.\n\nAs of the 2007-2008 timeframe, CRC was researching better ways of bridging audio, physical interfaces, and 3D visuals. To this end, FreeWRL now interfaces with MIDI\ndevices on both Linux and Mac OS X; and with Propellerheads Reason.\n\nFreeWRL has been developed by Open Source contributors, and managed by John Stewart, CRC Canada. It is believed to be the first sanctioned Open Source project\nsupported by the Federal Government of Canada, and gave CRC considerable in-depth knowledge on this and related technologies, in accordance with CRC's mandate. In April 2010 CRC cancelled its financial and official support of the project. The participants and project continued to thrive and in mid-2011 the list of ongoing improvements included smart phone and GPU initiatives.\n\nFreeWRL follows the Web3D Consortium's ISO standards, and is certified \"Interchange Profile\" Compliant by the Web3D Consortium.\nIt is in daily use worldwide. It is multi-threaded, written in C, and uses OpenGL for rendering. Source code is available . Development of FreeWRL has been continuous,\nand is expected to continue, with focus on interactivity, usability, and rendering fidelity. As with most Open Source projects, help with code development and testing is\nalways welcome.\n\n\n", "id": "7710797", "categories": [], "title": "FreeWRL"}

All steps along the manufacturing process, and more, must be taken into account in the design of the package for any given product. Package engineering is an interdisciplinary field integrating science, engineering, technology and management to protect and identify products for distribution, storage, sale, and use. It encompasses the process of design, evaluation, and production of packages. It is a system integral to the value chain that impacts product quality, user satisfaction, distribution efficiencies, and safety. includes industry-specific aspects of industrial engineering, marketing, materials science, industrial design and logistics. Packaging engineers must interact with research and development, manufacturing, marketing, graphic design, regulatory, purchasing, planning and so on. The package must sell and protect the product, while maintaining an efficient, cost-effective process cycle.\n\nEngineers develop packages from a wide variety of rigid and flexible materials. Some materials have scores or creases to allow controlled folding into package shapes (sometimes resembling origami). Packaging involves extrusion, thermoforming, molding and other processing technologies. Packages are often developed for high speed fabrication, filling, processing, and shipment. Packaging engineers use principles of structural analysis and thermal analysis in their evaluations.\n\nSome packaging engineers have backgrounds in other science, engineering, or design disciplines while some have college degrees specializing in this field.\n\nFormal packaging programs might be listed as package engineering, packaging science, packaging technology, etc. BE, BS, MS, M.Tech and PhD programs are available. Students in a packaging program typically begin with generalized science, business, and engineering classes before progressing into industry-specific topics such as shelf life stability, corrugated box design, cushioning, engineering design, labeling regulations, project management, food safety, robotics, RFID tags, quality management, package testing, packaging machinery, tamper-evident methods, recycling, computer-aided design, etc.\n\n\n", "id": "7710805", "categories": ["Packaging", "Engineering disciplines", "Packing problems"], "title": "Packaging engineering"}

It was formed in 1991 as a continuation of the underground cult group I Loschi Dezi.\n\nThe band, which mixes African and Latin traditions, was formed in 1991 by Luca Morino and Fabio Barovero, from the Piedmont region of Italy, and Bienvenu Tatè Nsongan, from Cameroon. The band's name has a double meaning: it references the Kenyan Mau Mau uprising against British colonial rule, and, in the Piedmontese language, \"Mau Mau\" designates \"people who come from afar\".\n\nThe band released their first EP, \"Soma la macia\" (\"We are the scrub\") in 1992. Sung in Piedmontese, the EP attracted the attention of Peter Gabriel, who invited them to record their first full album at his Real World Studios. The result was \"Sauta Rabel\" (\"Let's Jump, Let's Make Such a Row\"). It was followed by a tour of festivals, including appearances at the \"Palestine International Dance & Music Festival\" and the \"International Festival of Babylon\" in Iraq.\n\nIn 1994, Mau Mau returned to Real World Studios to record their second album, titled \"Bàss paradis\" (\"Low Paradise\"). They dedicated it to all people who suffered under colonialism. The album was released in quite a few European countries, as well as in Japan, and was followed by a tour numbering over 100 performances.\n\nTheir third album, \"Viva Mamanera\", was released in 1996. It was recorded with Eric Sarafin in Los Angeles, Paris (including in the Paris Metro) and Turin. \"Viva Mamanera\" includes more electronic sounds than earlier releases, and was successful in Italy and in France.\n\nIn the summer of 1996 the band played to over seventy thousand people when they opened for Paolo Conte at the Paleo Festival in Nyon.\n\nSubsequently, the principle band members travelled to Morocco to study Arab culture and to work with artists of different backgrounds. The result of this experience was \"Eldorado\", the band's 1998 album. It includes a collaboration with the \"Meninos do Pelo\" (the street urchins of Salvador de Bahia). The promotional tour began at the \"Feira das Mentiras\", Manu Chao's festival in Santiago de Compostela, (Galicia). After the tour, the band organized the \"PiemontAfrique Festival\" in Turin to promote the Africans culture.\n\nIn 2000, EMI released \"Safari Beach\", the fifth album of the band, a collaboration with Sargento Garcia. The album was less successful than earlier releases. \"Marasma General\", Mau Mau's first live album, is released in 2001. It includes a collaboration with Inti-Illimani on the song \"Eldorado\". The band went on hiatus after the release of the live album.\n\nDuring the break, Luca Morino wrote for the newspaper \"La Stampa\" and released a solo album called \"Mistic Turistic/Moleskine Ballads\". Fabio Barovero founded the folk band Banda Ionica and wrote soundtracks for movies, including Davide Ferrario's \"Dopo Mezzanotte\" (\"After Midnight\") and Alessandro d'Alatri's \"La Febbre\".\n\nMau Mau returned in 2006 with the album \"Dea\", which combined Brazilian and Piedmontese traditions and includes a collaboration with Sud Sound System. The tour in the same year included performances at the inauguration day for \"Turin Rome—World Book Capital\", organized by Subsonica. At this show the band plays a version of its song \"Campeador de Vigna\" that weaves together the thread of the Miguel Cervantes's \"Don Quixote\". The band also organized the inauguration day of \"Terra Madre\" in Turin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7710839", "categories": ["Italian musical groups", "1991 establishments in Italy"], "title": "Mau Mau (band)"}

It was built as a residence which is its current use.\n\nThis colonial saltbox house is sited on a large lot at the rural western edge of Middletown. Screened from the front by bushes, trees, and a stone wall, and on the east by a cedar paling fence, the house is very secluded. A two-story gambrel-roofed wing on the west, a two-car garage on the north, and a large nineteenth-century barn south of the house complete the estate.\n\nThis house was the home of Nehemiah Hubbard, a prominent banker and merchant of late eighteenth-century Middletown. The land, part of an original tract, belonged to the Hubbard family, noted early settlers of the town, for a number of generations. Nehemiah was in the fourth generation of Middletown Hubbards. Although the house was some distance from the commercial section of Middletown, Hubbard used the property as a home and for extensive farming operations.

The original school was part of the segregated \"colored schools\" system, which was abolished by 1954. The present school is part of the Baltimore City Public Schools system. It was named in memory of Paul Laurence Dunbar, a famous African-American poet, who had died twelve years before the school opened. In 1925, it was renamed Dunbar Junior High School, No. 133. In 1940, Dunbar became a high school and awarded its first diploma, the second school for African-Americans in Baltimore to do so.\nIn the summer of 2007, after thirty years of heavy use, the main high school building was emptied for renovations. Students were moved to Thomas G. Hayes Elementary School, behind Dunbar at 601 North Central Avenue. The renovations were completed in late August 2009 with costs totaling $32 million. Newly renovated features include science and robotics labs, wider interior hallways, larger windows, a new cafeteria, and a new library.\n\nDunbar High School is a magnet school, offering biotechnology, emergency medical technology (EMT), accounting, nursing, and health care delivery systems programs. Dunbar High School has been named a Bronze Medal School by U.S. News and World Report.\n\nThe male varsity sports offered at Dunbar are baseball, basketball, football, soccer, and wrestling. The women's varsity sports offered are badminton, basketball, soccer, softball, and volleyball. The four varsity teams that are coed are cross country, swimming, indoor track and field, and outdoor track and field.\n\nThe Baltimore City Public Schools withdrew from the Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) in 1993, its long-time home since 1909 and the home of the formerly segregated schools, Dunbar and Douglass, since 1956. The schools then joined the larger, statewide Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA), and since then Dunbar has had great success in the class 1A division. The Dunbar football team, the Poets, won state championships in 1994, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2017.\n\nSince 1993, the school's basketball team, the Poets, have won the State Championship fifteen times. Additionally, the Poets were National Champions in 1983, 1985 and 1992. Dunbar's girls basketball team, the Lady Poets, have excelled as well, winning the state girls basketball title in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2011 and 2012.\n\nDunbar is one of the partner schools of Thread, formerly the Incentive Mentoring Program, an organization formed by Johns Hopkins School of Medicine that tutors high school students to help prevent them from failing high school.

LGC serves customers in various fields including pharmaceuticals, agricultural biotechnology, diagnostics, food, environment, government, and academia.\n\nLGC participates in the European Reference Materials consortium, together with the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) of the European Commission's Directorate General Joint Research Centre and the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM).\n\nIts operations are extensively accredited to international quality standards such as ISO/IEC 17025, ISO 13485, ISO 9001, GMP, GLP and ISO Guide 34.\nThe Government Chemist is a person appointed with statutory duties prescribed in seven acts of Parliament, supported by the Laboratory of the Government Chemist (LGC). In addition this person acts as an advisor to the government on relevant matters. As of 2018, both these functions are funded by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), but the LGC is a private company, and the Government Chemist, Julian Braybrook, is an employee of LGC. \nIn 1842 the Department of Excise set up a laboratory to check tobacco for adulteration, i.e. the addition of other substances to increase profits and evade duty. (The amount of tobacco being sold was much greater than that being imported.) It had one employee, George Phillips who used a microscope and chemical tests, most of which he had developed himself. The work of the laboratory expanded to check for adulteration in pepper, beer and coffee with further staff being employed under Phillips, and a new laboratory in 1859, by which time Excise had joined the Inland Revenue. In 1861 it dealt with 11,000 samples. The work also expanded to include foodstuffs and soap and in 1874 Phillips had 12 permanent staff. The Inland Revenue Laboratory as it was now known was appointed a Referee Analyst under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875, i.e. one whose findings were accepted in a court of law. This greatly added to the number of samples being submitted. \n\nIn 1894 an official Government Laboratory was set up, combining both the Inland Revenue Laboratory and a separate Customs Laboratory which had been set up in 1860, moving to purpose-built premises in 1897. The head was Dr Edward Thorpe, with the title of Principal Chemist, who expanded its activities to include health problems caused by the match and lead-glazing industries. His report of 1907 states that 173,606 analyses and examinations were made on behalf of the departments of Customs and Excise, other departments and in connection with two acts, the Food And Drugs Act and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act. \n\nIn 1911 the Government Laboratory became an independent department of government (the smallest one under the Treasury) as the Department of the Government Chemist. The Principal, Dr James Dobbie was the first to be given the new title of Government Chemist. The analysis of tobacco remained a substantial part of the work, being greatly increased during World War I because of supplies to troops. Demand increased with interwar legislation, and the Laboratory had to do considerable original research to develop new and better methods of analysis. The number of routine samples between 1920 and 1939 went from 199,388 to 430,314. It was also asked by government to look into methods associated with the carriage of dangerous goods, atmospheric pollution, and the possible dangers to health arising from the use of tetraethyllead in motor fuel. World War II produced a peak demand of 560 354 samples.\nIn 1959 the Government Laboratory ceased to be a separate department but instead was under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and in 1963 moved to new premises in Cornwall House, Waterloo, London as the Laboratory of the Government Chemist. In 1989 it was changed into an Executive Agency under the Department of Trade and Industry. This gave it the remit to seek outside work (which it already did to a significant extent) and earn income to fully cover costs, while having more management autonomy.. It also moved to new premises in Teddington.\nAs part of a general programme of privatization of public services by the government, Michael Heseltine announced that Laboratory of the Government Chemist would become independent non-profit distributing company limited by guarantee, or could possibly be bought by a company or institution which could show that it would still remain sufficiently independent to fulfill its statutory duties. However the undertakings required to meet these obligations indefinitely meant that 40 initial expressions of interest produced only three considered suitable to bid, and no actual bids. A consortium of Laboratory employees, the Royal Society of Chemistry and 3i put together a bid in 1995 which was accepted, taking the form of a management buyout and it became LGC Ltd in February 1996.\n\nSince privatisation, LGC has changed ownership and significantly expanded its activities. Valued at £3 million when privatized, it was sold for £80 million in 2003 to LGV, part of Legal & General, who sold it in 2010 to Bridgepoint Capital for the sum of £257 million, who in turn sold it in 2015 to KKR. \n\nEmployee numbers have risen from 270 in 1996 to about 2,600 in 2017, as the company has grown organically and through multiple acquisitions. Significant acquisitions since 1996 include: KBioscience, AGOWA, Forensic Alliance Limited, Mikromol, Promochem, University Diagnostics Ltd, HFL, ARMI, VHG Labs, Quotient Bioanalytical Sciences, Dr Ehrenstorfer, Biosearch Technologies, Thistle QA, Maine Standards, Prime Synthesis, immunosuppressive proficiency testing (PT) scheme from ASI, BRC Global Standards and o2si; and the outsourcing of analytical services from BNG and Sentinel Performance Solutions.\n\n\n", "id": "7710982", "categories": ["Organisations based in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames", "Standards organisations in the United Kingdom", "Chemical companies of the United Kingdom", "Privatised executive agencies of the United Kingdom government"], "title": "LGC Ltd"}

He established the relief agency Calcutta Rescue.\n\nPreger graduated from St Edmund Hall, Oxford with a post-graduate degree in economics and political science. He worked for a few years as a farmer in Wales before selling his farm and deciding to become a doctor instead. In 1965, he was admitted into the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin at the age of 35.\n\nIn 1972, when he had just finished his internship, although his plans had been to dedicate his life to the poor in South or Central America, and he had prepared himself by learning Spanish, he answered a call over the radio for doctors to help the people of then newly independent Bangladesh. He was soon in Dhaka, where he worked, under squalid conditions, in refugee camps filled with Urdu-speaking people who intended to return to Pakistan. He learnt Urdu and later Bengali. In 1975, he set up a 90-bed clinic in Dhaka and two farms on the outskirts of the city.\n\nHowever, his work in Dhaka came to an abrupt end when he discovered that Dutch non-government organisation Terre des Hommes was operating a child-smuggling racket, and exposed it despite the Bangladesh government warning him not to. He was deported to Bangkok in 1979.\n\nAfter being deported from Bangladesh, he went to India the same year and worked in Kolkata for six months under Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity. However, Preger criticized the inadequate conditions in Mother Teresa's charities, saying \"If one wants to give love, understanding and care, one uses sterile needles. This is probably the richest order in the world. Many of the dying there do not have to be dying in a strictly medical sense.\"\n\nPreger thought that he would be able to do more if he operated independently, and started a clinic for the poor below the flyover connecting the Howrah Bridge. He also requested a work permit, which ultimately was not given.\n\nToday, Calcutta Rescue operates three clinics, two schools and two vocational centres. It employs 150 locally hired staff. \nSupport Groups for the work of Preger have been formed in several other countries, mostly spurred on by tourists returning home, who had witnessed his selfless work : England, Switzerland, France, Germany, Norway, The Netherlands, Canada, the US.\n\nIn 1980, the Foreigners' Registration Office (FRO) of the West Bengal government noted that Preger had accepted a donation from a missionary organisation based in the United States, and demanded that he declare himself as a missionary worker, in addition to being a doctor. He resolved this only after explaining to New Delhi officials that he was not a missionary worker. (Calcutta Rescue is entirely secular), and was permitted to stay in Kolkata without a visa. In 1981, the FRO charged him with entering India without a missionary visa, but he was released on bail. The FRO dropped the charge in 1989 after intervention by the then high commissioner of New Zealand to India, Sir Edmund Hillary.\n\nAfter Preger registered Calcutta Rescue as a charity in 1991, he started two more clinics in Kolkata and donations came in from eight European countries. He also obtained a resident's permit. However, the government refused to grant him the clearance needed to accept foreign donations. Preger then sued the government in Kolkata's courts. Eventually the courts struck down the government's rejection, and Preger was allowed to accept 1.5 million rupees per month in donations.\n\nAs of 1999, Preger has to apply for a re-entry visa from the FRO before he leaves India for any reason. Most of these applications have required legal intervention to succeed. On 23 February that year, the FRO suddenly asked Preger to leave India within seven days. The Calcutta High Court intervened by ordering the government to speedily grant him a return visa.\n\nAged 88 and in declining health, Preger retired in January 2019 and returned to the United Kingdom after 40 years of service to the poor in Kolkata. The work continues in his absence. \"\n\nIn 1993, Preger was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his \"continued perseverance and incredible selflessness\".\n\nIn 2017, Preger was named \"Philanthropist of the Year\" by The Asian Awards at a ceremony in London, England on 5th May 2017. \" \"\n\n", "id": "7711074", "categories": ["20th-century English medical doctors", "Members of the Order of the British Empire", "1930 births", "Alumni of St Edmund Hall, Oxford", "Living people", "British humanitarians"], "title": "Jack Preger"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7711194", "text": "Speech codes theory\n\nSpeech codes theory refers to a framework for communication in a given speech community. As an academic discipline, it explores the manner in which groups communicate based on societal, cultural, gender, occupational or other factors.\n\nA speech code can also be defined as \"a historically enacted socially constructed system of terms, meanings, premises, and rules, pertaining to communicative conduct.\" \"This theory seeks to answer questions about the existence of speech codes, their substance, the way they can be discovered, and their force upon people within a culture\" (Griffin, 2005). This theory deals with only one type of human behavior, which is speech acts.\n\nA basic definition of speech code by sociologist Basil Bernstein is, \"...a coding principle is a rule governing what to say and how to say it in a particular context\".\n\nWork by Gerry Philipsen has been influential in the development of speech codes theory. Work in the 1960s influences the theory as it stands today in the field of communication.\n\nBefore speech codes theory got its name Philipsen first referred to this theory as the Ethnography of Communication. He decided to change it because he recognized that many people could not get past the idea of Ethnography as simply a research method. He was considered a naturalist who watched, listened and recorded communicative conduct in a cultures natural setting. Em Griffin stated that, \"Many people can't get past the idea of ethnography as simply a research method.\" With that being said, Philipsen moved from description to explanation, resulting in him labeling his work \"speech codes theory\". Philipsen's ultimate goal was to develop a theory that would capture the relationship between communication and culture.\n\n\"The Speech Codes theory was created for ultimately two purposes. The first was to distill some of what might be learned from a large body of fieldwork research on culturally distinctive ways of speaking. The second was to provide a focus for further research and discussion. The theory was first published in prototypical form with an introduction to the concept of speech codes and a presentation of four empirically grounded principles about speech codes. It was presented as a formal theoretical statements with five empirical grounded propositions, four of which were carried over intact from the earlier version.\" (Philipsen, Coutu and Covarrubias).\n\nThere were four questions that Philipsen sought to answer through his research on the Speech Code Theory:\n\nWorks by Basil Bernstein heavily influenced Philipsen. Bernstein used the term \"speech codes\" in sociology and further elaborated on speech codes and their contexts. He stated that, \"within the same society, there can exist different social groups or social classes whose communicative practices differ in important ways\" (Philipsen,1997). Bernstein argues that people have different ways of speaking, which shapes and reinforces their understanding of themselves, other people, and social life. Bernstein believes that a coding principle is, \"a rule governing what to say and how to say it in a particular context.\" \n\nLisa Coutu, an ethnographer, helped to formulate the second proposition of Speech Codes Theory. This proposition states that within any given speech community, there are multiple speech codes. Her evidence comes from a large body of research surrounding Robert McNamara's book, \"In Retrospect.\"\n\nAnother important influence is the work of anthropologist and linguist Dell Hymes. His focus was on local speech practices in various cultural and social situations.\n\nDell Hymes constructed the S.P.E.A.K.I.N.G. model to aid in the search for speech codes in specific speech communities. The letters stand for the following (as reported by Miller):\n\n\nAn often cited study, the \"Teamsterville\" study, was conducted by Philipsen in Chicago. The study took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. According to Miller, the \"Teamsterville\" nickname was given to the area of Chicago studied because the primary job of the area's men was truck driving. For three years, Philipsen spoke with everyone he could; from a kid on the corner to the women on their front porches, and men in bars. Although the people all spoke English, Philipsen could recognize the differences between their speech codes and his. As a follow up, another study, the \"Nacirema\" (American spelled backwards) study was conducted that contrasted the speech of Teamsterville with that of the average American.\nThe typical Nacirema speech is a \"generalized U.S. conversation that is carried at the public level and at the interpersonal level in face-to-face interaction.\"\n\nUsing these two studies above, Philipsen outlined statements that summarize the work within speech code theory. The statements are reported by Em Griffin as follows:\n\n1. The distinctiveness of speech codes (In any given culture, there is a speech code.)\n\n2. The multiplicity of speech codes (Multiple speech codes exist in any given speech community.)\n\n3. The substance of speech codes (A speech code has a distinctive psychology, sociology and rhetoric.)\n\n4. The meaning of speech codes (The speech community assesses the meanings of speech.)\n\n5. The site of speech codes (The terms, premises, and rules of a speech code are inextricably woven into the speech itself).\n\n6. The discursive force of speech codes (Speech Codes impact life.)\n\nAccording to Philipsen there are three defining characteristics of the speech codes theory and he illustrated these by referencing Carbaugh's previous study. The first characteristic being that speech codes are, \"grounded in the observation of communication conduct in particular times and places\" (Gudykunst, 2005). Speech codes theory is concerned about observing communication conduct through noticing, describing, interpreting and explaining the findings. The second is that speech codes present, \"a way to interpret or explain observed communicative conduct by reference to situated codes of meaning and value.\" Different meanings are interpreted in multiple ways depending on that community's discursive life. The last characteristic is that this theory, \"provides a general understanding of communicative conduct.\"\n\nPhilipsen characterizes the Speech Code Theory by stating that, \"It is general in 3 ways. It presents a characterization of the nature of all speech codes. It contains a general answer to the question of how an observer might systematically try to learn about the particularities of particulars, local ways of speaking. It presents a general answer to the question of how speech codes relate to communicative conduct.\"\n\nAccording to Gerry Philipsen, the Speech Codes Theory is a historically enacted, socially constructed system of terms, meanings, premises, and rules, pertaining to communicative conduct. One of his six general propositions is that wherever there is a distinctive culture, there is to be found a distinctive speech code. For example, when we are immersed in a new community with a culture that is unfamiliar to us, we often find certain patterns of speech to be strange. Because we are an outsider, we pick up on these differences initially. Yet over time, we grow accustomed to these patterns and no longer notice a difference in pronunciation and/or grammar. Speech codes are seen in the way a group determines when to communicate and what is appropriate to say at a particular time.\n\nPhilipsen addresses the criticisms of Speech Code Theory by saying that:\n\n1. \"Speech Codes Theory does not account for manifestations of power in discourse. This is a matter of omission in the theoretical assumptions, methodological framework, and examination of fieldwork materials.\n\n2. Speech Codes Theory treats culture as overly deterministic. A corollary to this is that it reifies culture as a static entity.\" \n\nThis is a strong force of conduct within communication. It has a social perspective that directly addresses the issue of \"a universal possibility in any body of discourse of manifestations of power, solidarity, intimacy\" and other important aspects of social life.\n\n", "id": "7711194", "categories": [], "title": "Speech codes theory"}

More recently, Kawamoto is known for owning 30 properties in the Kāhala area of Honolulu where he has allowed them to be run down, attracting many complaints and media attention. Although these homes are vacant, boarded up and often vandalized, their estimated total value is $200 million. In September 2013, Kawamoto sold all of his Hawaii assets to Alexander and Baldwin for $128 million.

Together with fellow Tosa \"samurai\" Sakamoto Ryōma, he was attracted by the radical pro-Imperial \"Sonnō jōi\" movement. After being promoted, he essentially seized power within the Tosa Domain's politics and exerted influence on Tosa \"daimyō\" Yamauchi Toyoshige to call on \"shōgun\" Tokugawa Yoshinobu to return power peacefully to the Emperor.\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Gotō was appointed to a number of posts, including that of Governor of Osaka, and \"sangi\" (councillor), but later from the Meiji government in 1873 over disagreement with the government's policy of restraint toward Korea (i.e. the \"Seikanron\" debate) and, more generally, in opposition to the Chōshū-Satsuma domination of the new government. Jointly with Itagaki Taisuke, he submitted a memorandum calling for the establishment of a popularly elected parliament. In 1874, together with Itagaki Taisuke, and Etō Shinpei and Soejima Taneomi of Hizen Province, he formed the \"Aikoku Kōtō\" (Public Party of Patriots), declaring, \"We, the thirty millions of people in Japan are all equally endowed with certain definite rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring and possessing property, and obtaining a livelihood and pursuing happiness. These rights are by Nature bestowed upon all men, and, therefore, cannot be taken away by the power of any man.\" This anti-government stance appealed to the discontented remnants of the \"samurai\" class and the rural aristocracy (who resented centralized taxation) and peasants (who were discontented with high prices and low wages).\n\nAfter the Osaka Conference of 1875, he returned briefly to the government, participating in the \"Genrōin\". He also managed a coal mine in Kyūshū (the Takashima Coal Mine), but finding it to be losing money, sold his interest to Iwasaki Yatarō.\n\nIn 1881, he returned to politics, assisting Itagaki Taisuke found the Jiyūto (Liberal Party) which developed the \"daidō danketsu\" (coalition) movement in 1887.\n\nIn 1889, Gotō joined the Kuroda administration as Communications Minister, remaining in that post under the first Yamagata cabinet and first Matsukata cabinet. Under the new \"kazoku\" peerage system, he was elevated to \"hakushaku\" (count). In the second Itō cabinet he became Agriculture and Commerce minister. He was implicated in a scandal involving futures trading, and was forced to retire. After a heart attack, he retired to his summer home in Hakone, Kanagawa, where he died in 1896.

His dam, Princess Turia, won the 1956 Kentucky Oaks, as well as the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes and Delaware Handicap during her racing career. Princess Turia's other progeny include graded stakes winner Turn to Turia and full brothers to Forward Pass Ever On, Dinamode, and Prince Turian.\n\nPrince Turian stood stallion duties in Venezuela, Dinamode stood in the United States at Marablue Farm in Florida, and Ever On had a brief stallion career in the United States at Winston Farm, the farm of his owner Suzanne Perdue.\n\nOwned and bred by Calumet Farm, the colt was trained by Henry Forrest.\n\nRacing at age three, Forward Pass won several graded stakes races, including three important U.S. Triple Crown prep races: the Everglades Stakes, the Florida Derby and the Blue Grass Stakes.\n\nThe betting favorite going into the 1968 Kentucky Derby, Forward Pass finished second, but winner Dancer's Image was disqualified to last place after traces of phenylbutazone were discovered in the mandatory post-race urinalysis. As a result, Forward Pass was declared the winner. The controversy filled the sporting news of media outlets in North America and was a cover story for \"Sports Illustrated\", which referred to it as \"the year's major sports story.\"\n\nIt was revealed that Dancer's Image had been plagued by sore ankles and on the Sunday prior to the Kentucky Derby, his handlers had a veterinarian give the horse a phenylbutazone tablet, a pain killer commonly used to relieve inflammation of the joints, which was legal at many race tracks in the United States but not at Churchill Downs. However, it was still a legitimate practice, as the medication would dissipate from the horse's system during the six days before the Derby. When the horse's post-Derby urinalysis revealed the phenylbutazone, his owner and handlers believed someone else may have been motivated to give the colt another dose of the drug, and they filed an appeal of the disqualification. The Kentucky State Racing Commission examined the matter and ordered distribution of the purse with first money to Forward Pass. This decision was upheld in April 1972 by Kentucky's highest court in Kentucky State Racing Commission v. Fuller, 481 S.W.2d 298 (Ky, 1972). In a subsequent decision, the Commission ordered that Forward Pass be considered the winner of the 1968 Kentucky Derby and that his owners were to receive the Derby's gold cup.\n\nIt was not until Country House in 2019 that another horse was declared winner of the Kentucky Derby as the result of a disqualification.\n\nIn a rematch with Dancer's Image in the Preakness Stakes, Forward Pass won by six lengths. As the third leg of the U.S. Triple Crown approached, the Derby controversy raged on. A victory by Forward Pass in the Belmont Stakes would make him the first Triple Crown winner in twenty years and many fans, experts, and racing commentators felt he would be an illegitimate champion. In the Belmont, Forward Pass finished second by one and a quarter lengths to Greentree Stable's colt Stage Door Johnny, a horse who had not raced in the Derby or the Preakness but had been specifically bred and conditioned for competing at longer distances.\n\nIn 1968, the Turf and Sports Digest poll saw Forward Pass named as Champion 3-Yr-Old Male. The other two organizations (Thoroughbred Racing Association and \"Daily Racing Form\") voted for Stage Door Johnny.\n\nRetired at the end of the 1968 racing season to Calumet Farm, Forward Pass was sent to stand at stud at Calumet Farm. In 1977, he was sold to a breeding farm in Japan. He died there in 1980.\n\nEven today, controversy and speculation surrounds the 1968 Kentucky Derby. \"The New York Times\" calls the ruling the \"most controversial decision in all of Triple Crown racing.\" The use of phenylbutazone was subsequently approved on March 6, 1974, by the Kentucky Racing Commission in recognition of medical research that showed it does not enhance a horse's performance.\n\n\n", "id": "7711277", "categories": ["1980 racehorse deaths", "Racehorses trained in the United States", "Preakness Stakes winners", "Racehorses bred in Kentucky", "Kentucky Derby winners", "1965 racehorse births"], "title": "Forward Pass (horse)"}

It was developed in 1946 by Wellman Chamberlin for the National Geographic Society.\nChamberlin was chief cartographer for the Society from 1964 to 1971.\nThe projection's principal feature is that it compromises between distortions of area, direction, and distance. A Chamberlin trimetric map therefore gives an excellent overall sense of the region being mapped.\nMany National Geographic Society maps of single continents use this projection.\n\nAs originally implemented, the projection algorithm begins with the selection of three points near the outer boundary of the area to be mapped. From these three base points, the true distances to a point on the mapping area are calculated. The distances from each of the three base points are then drawn on the plane by compass circles. Unlike triangulation on a plane where three such compass circles will intersect at a unique point, the compass circles from a sphere do not intersect precisely at a point. A small triangle is generated from the intersections, and the center of this triangle is calculated as the mapped point.\nA Chamberlin trimetric projection map was originally obtained by graphically mapping points at regular intervals of latitude and longitude, with shorelines and other features then mapped by interpolation. Based on the principles of the projection, precise, but lengthy, mathematical formulas were later developed for calculating this projection by computer for a spherical earth.\n\nThe Chamberlin trimetric projection is neither conformal nor equal-area. Rather, the projection was conceived to minimize distortion of distances everywhere with the side-effect of balancing between areal equivalence and conformality. This projection is not appropriate for mapping the entire sphere because the outer boundary would loop and overlap itself in most configurations.\n\n\n", "id": "7711317", "categories": ["Map projections"], "title": "Chamberlin trimetric projection"}

If a shareholder declined to tender, that shareholder risked being cashed-out for $54 in risky debt instruments instead of cash.\n\nIn response to the Mesa tender offer, Unocal made a self-tender at $72 for all but the Mesa shares. The Unocal board attempted to launch a self-tender offer to combat an unsolicited tender offer by Mesa Petroleum (Mesa). The self-tender offer would be triggered upon Mesa acquiring sixty-four million shares of Unocal, and would mean that Unocal itself would buy-back 49% of the outstanding shares of Unocal - but none of the shares to be bought-back could be shares held by Mesa.\n\nThe trial court found that this selective exchange offer was not legally permissible, and issued a preliminary injunction against the use of the self-tender offer defense.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court reversed the trial court.\n\nIt found that the Unocal's board of directors had reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to corporate policy or effectiveness existed and that the response was reasonable in relation to the threat posed. This reasonable relation analysis permitted an analysis of the price, nature, and timing of the offer as well as the impact on shareholders, creditors, customers, employees, and the community. Note that this permission to consider other constituencies besides the shareholders was curtailed in \"Revlon v. MacAndrews\".\n\n\"The Unocal\" test the court established in this case to determine whether directors may try to prevent a take-over is a two pronged test. The two prongs include:\n\nNote that whereas \"Cheff v. Mathes\" had sanctioned greenmail, or payment to the raider to go away, in Unocal the court sanctioned reverse greenmail, or payment to shareholders excluding the raider.\n\nThe significance of the opinion flows from the court's premise that, due to the inherent conflict of interest involved, takeover defenses pose a significant danger to shareholders. In essence, the Unocal court feared that a board may use takeover defenses to impermissibly prevent threats to corporate policy or to the board's control over the corporation. As a result, there was a need for \"an enhanced duty\" on the board, so as to ensure that their decisions in this area were meant only to further the welfare of the corporation and its shareholders. Therefore, the court ruled that in order for the board to be allotted the protection of the business judgment rule, the board must demonstrate that it was responding to a legitimate threat to corporate policy and effectiveness, and that its actions were \"reasonable in relation to the threat posed.\"\n\n", "id": "7711350", "categories": ["United States corporate case law", "1985 in United States case law", "Union Oil Company of California", "Delaware state case law"], "title": "Unocal Corp. v.

While involved in World War II, he studied malnutrition, and later was involved in food research important for space exploration.\n\nA native of Lawrence, Massachusetts, Goldblith was the son of a Russian immigrant. He received his S.B. in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1940. During his student days, he was also involved in Reserve Officers' Training Corps, and began serving with the United States Army Corps of Engineers as a Second Lieutenant in the Philippines.\n\nWhile at the Philippines, Goldblith would be part of the US Army contingent involved in the Battle of the Philippines and captured by the Japanese following the Battle of Corregidor. Having been surrendered on Corregidor, Goldblith avoided the Bataan Death March and Camp O'Donnell, being sent instead to one of the Cabanatuan POW camps. In November 1942 he endured a trip aboard the \"hell ship\", Nagato Maru, to Japan.\n\nDespite being a POW, Goldblith was able to conduct scientific research, even studying malnutrition and related diseases affecting those around him. His knowledge of botany and chemistry would save the lives of many of his fellow soldiers while a POW. These studies included beriberi, hypoproteinemia, and Vitamin A deficiencies. Goldblith was able to use iodine from his medical kit to dose the foul water in his canteen in an effort to prevent dysentery. His research would be published in the journal \"Science\" in September 1946 and in the \"Office of Naval Research Reports\" in 1947.\n\nGoldblith would earn two Bronze Stars and one Silver Star for his service and be discharged as a Captain in 1946. In later years, Goldblith and his wife, the former Diana Greenberg, would remain in close contact with the Belgian Catholic nuns in the Philippines who were instrumental in saving the lives of so many lives with their food and medical supplies during the war.\n\nUpon his discharge from the US Army, Goldblith would return to MIT where he would earn his S.M. in 1947 and his Ph.D. in 1949, both in food technology. He would join the food technology faculty at MIT in 1949, rising to the rank of professor in 1959. Goldblith would serve as acting department chair following Bernard E. Proctor's death in 1959 and remained in that position until Nevin Scrimshaw took over as department chair in 1961. Goldblith would remain as professor until 1974 when he became MIT's director of the Industrial Liaison Program (ILP), a position he would hold until 1978. After that, Goldblith would be promoted to MIT's vice president of resource development until 1986, then promoted again to Senior advisor to the President of MIT, where he would retire in 1992.\n\nDuring his service at MIT, Goldblith led the development of food irradiation, of freeze-drying and microwave technology, all of which would prove important for the Space Race. This included Project Mercury, Project Gemini, and Project Apollo, but would later stretch to Skylab, the Space Shuttle, and even to the International Space Station.\n\nThe first graduate student that Goldblith worked with was Yiachi Aikawa from Japan. Goldblith's work with Aikawa would both develop a lifelong friendship and allow Goldblith to heal from the emotional wounds he suffered as a POW from World War II. Aikawa would later create TechnoVenture Co., Ltd., the first venture capital firm in Japan. He was also the son of Yoshisuke Aikawa, the founder of Nissan Motors. Their relationship would lead to the opening of the MIT Japan office in 1976 as well. It would also earn Goldblith the Second Grade of the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1984 for his efforts in strengthening Japanese-American relationships, only the second non-Japanese to do so at that time.\n\nGoldblith authored over 250 articles in scientific journals and edited or co-edited six books in food science and technology. He would also author three additional books on the history of MIT, including his 1996 autobiography \"Appetite for Life.\"\n\n\nGolblith married Diana Greenberg in 1941 and they would remain married until her death in 1990. They would produce two sons (Errol (died 1963) and Jonathan), one daughter (Judith), and two granddaughters (Sarah and Rachel).\n\nGoldblith died on December 28, 2001 in Peabody, Massachusetts. A memorial service was held at MIT on May 28, 2002 to honor Goldblith. MIT established the Samuel A. Goldblith Career Development Chair in 1993, partially funded by Aikawa's family. This chair has been held by Peter Dedon (Toxicology), James L. Sherley (Bioengineering), and since 2006, Stuart Licht (Chemistry).\n\n\n\n", "id": "7711364", "categories": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni", "Recipients of the Silver Star", "American food scientists", "People from Lawrence, Massachusetts", "Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty", "American people of Russian-Jewish descent", "United States Army officers", "American army personnel of World War II", "1919 births", "Fellows of the Institute of Food Technologists", "Jewish American scientists", "World War II prisoners of war held by Japan", "Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences", "Bataan Death March prisoners"], "title": "Samuel Abraham Goldblith"}

It was formed by the governments of Australia (50%), New Zealand (30%) and the United Kingdom (20%) to pursue trans-Pacific flights. BCPA was later taken over by Qantas.\n\nBCPA was formed by treaty through an \"Agreement between the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom for the Formation of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited\" with an initial capital of 10,000 Australian Pounds. The initial agreement was signed on 4 August 1947, with ownership restrictions between the governments removed on 27 October 1949.\n\nThe original BCPA route was Sydney – Auckland – Fiji – Canton Island – Hawaii – San Francisco – Vancouver and later included Melbourne. Initially, BCPA chartered all flights to Australian National Airways, which used its Douglas DC-4s. The inaugural flight departed from Sydney on 15 September 1946.\n\nIn late 1948, BCPA took delivery of the first of four Douglas DC-6 aircraft, outfitted as Pullman-type sleepers, bundling board options with small port holes bedside. Each aircraft was named for one of the four sailing vessels of Captain Cook, \"Resolution\", \"Discovery\", \"Adventure\" and \"Endeavour\".\n\nThe airline had ordered six de Havilland Comet jet airliners in 1952 for delivery in 1954. In 1953 it had agreed to buy three Comet IIs for delivery at the end of 1956 and retain two of the DC-6s for tourist-class carriage.\n\nIn October 1953 discussions were held by the three governments to allow the airline to be taken over by Qantas Empire Airways.

On April 16, 2004, he was kidnapped from an Abidjan parking lot and has not been seen since. In early 2012 remains suspected to belong to Kieffer were found in the department of Issia, in the west of Côte d'Ivoire.\n\nKieffer was born and raised in France; his family lives in the region of Rhône-Alpes. He studied law in Montreal, and while there married a Canadian woman and obtained Canadian nationality; this marriage produced a son Sébastien-Cédric but later resulted in divorce. Kieffer was married to Osange Silou-Kieffer; they have a daughter Canelle.\n\nFrom 1984 to 2002, Kieffer worked for the French financial newspaper \"La Tribune\". Following this he worked in West Africa for a number of years, and wrote articles concerning Political corruption in African governments for several different publications.\n\nAmong these publications were his former newspaper \"La Tribune\" and also \"La Lettre du Continent\" as well as several Ivorian newspapers.\n\nAt approximately 1 p.m. on April 16, 2004, Kieffer was kidnapped in the parking lot of a shopping center in Abidjan. At the time he was working on a story about money laundering and illegal currency transfers allegedly involving the Ivorian government.\n\nHe had been drawn there by someone claiming to have leads on a government corruption story he was assembling. He has never been seen since, nor has a corpse been found. To this day his fate and the identity of his kidnappers remains a mystery.\n\nIn a 2006 interview regarding her book \"Bitter Chocolate\", CBC journalist Carol Off claimed that Kieffer's disappearance and probable murder was related to his investigation of the shady practices involving the Ivorian government and the cocoa industry. She had travelled to Côte d'Ivoire to research her book, and claimed that upon her arrival in the country Canadian embassy officials had given her a stern warning regarding Kieffer:\n\nIn May 2004, civil proceedings concerning Kieffer's disappearance were launched in France by Kieffer's family and Reporters sans frontières. The French magistrate charged with the case was sent to Abidjan and there interrogated Michel Legré, a brother-in-law of the wife of Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo, who was allegedly the last person to see Kieffer alive. Legré provided a list of names of influential Ivorians who he alleged were involved in Kieffer's kidnapping.\n\nThis list of names was subsequently published in some Ivorian newspapers. In 2004, Legré was arrested in Abidjan by Ivorian police and charged with complicity in a kidnapping, illegal imprisonment and murder. He was also charged with defamation for naming the individuals on the list. Legré was provisionally released in 2005 and has since fled the country – or is in an unknown location.\n\nSubsequently, the French magistrate was not granted access to all of the persons named by Legré. The magistrate questioned Legré himself on 21 October 2004, and on 13 December 2004 requested that Legré be temporarily moved to France, as he felt Legré was unable to speak freely in his Ivorian prison. However, the French government initially did not aid in this request, for which they were denounced by Kieffer's wife Osange Silou-Kieffer.\n\nOn August 23, 2007, French president Nicolas Sarkozy met with Kieffer's wife Osange Silou-Kieffer in Paris, and expressed his determination to aid in the case. Silou-Kieffer claimed that Sarkozy's predecessor Jacques Chirac had never answered her request for a meeting.\n\nSilou-Kieffer indicated she had asked Sarkozy to pressure Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo to allow French judges to interrogate Ivorian suspects in the case.\n\nIn July 2008 Simone Gbagbo – First Lady of Côte d'Ivoire – was formally called for questioning by a French investigative judge, examining the April 2004 disappearance and presumed death of Kieffer. Speculation has surrounded the Ivorian first family, as Michel Legré is the brother-in-law of Simone Gbagbo. French judicial officials have arrested and are investigating Jean-Tony Oulaï, a former member of the Ivorian Secret Services, whom they detained in Paris in 2006. Jean-Tony Oulaï's driver at the time Berte Seydou, as well as Mr Kieffer's brother, have alleged that Ms. Gbagbo and former Ivorian Minister of Planning and Development Paul-Antoine Bohoun Bouabré have knowledge of the events surrounding Mr Kieffer's death, and that Oulaï is responsible.\n\n", "id": "7711434", "categories": ["20th-century Canadian journalists", "Writers from Montreal", "Journalists from Quebec", "French male journalists", "Missing people", "Disappeared journalists", "21st-century French journalists", "History of Ivory Coast", "2000s missing person cases", "1949 births", "20th-century French journalists", "Canadian male journalists"], "title": "Guy-André Kieffer"}

It was a conversion of existing Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks, re-fitted with the larger turret of the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank.\n\nThe Type 4 Ke-Nu was a variant of the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank. The original Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank was armed with a low muzzle velocity 57 mm tank gun. Operational experience against the Soviet Red Army at Nomonhan during the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts in 1939 revealed that this gun was inadequate against opposing armor, and a new higher velocity 47 mm tank gun was developed. This was installed in the Type 97 Chi-Ha with a larger turret to produce the Type 97-\"kai\" \"Shinhoto\" version. This left a large number of surplus Type 97 Chi-Ha turrets, which were later retrofitted onto the hulls of the obsolete Type 95 Ha-Go light tank. The result was designated the Type 4 Ke-Nu. The retrofitting did decrease the problem of cramped turret place for the crew, which had been encountered in an earlier attempt to up-gun Type 95 tanks with a 57 mm tank gun in a modified turret of a prototype known as the Type 3 Ke-Ri light tank. As for the Type 4 Ke-Nu, approximately 100 units were converted in 1944.\n\nEssentially a Type 95 light tank with a Type 97 medium tank gun turret, the Type 4 Ke-Nu had slightly better firepower, but the retrofitting increased the weight of the tank to 8.4 tons. This reduced the top speed of the tank to 40 km/h. Given the replacement turret had thicker armor, it did provide the crew with some additional protection in that area, but did nothing to alleviate the Type 95's greatest weakness of the lack of suitable armor protection for the hull. Maximum armor protection for the tank (25 mm) was provided by the Type 97 turret, but it was defeated by the 37 mm, 75 mm and 2-pounders mounted on Allied tanks.\n\nThe conversion coming in 1944 was too late to make any impact on Japanese combat operations, and most of the Type 4 Ke-Nu were retained in the Japanese home islands in anticipation of the projected American invasion. Some were assigned to units in Korea and Manchukuo, and saw brief combat against Soviet forces in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. A surviving Type 4 Ke-Nu captured in Manchukuo is on display in Moscow at the Kubinka Tank Museum.\n\n\n", "id": "7711449", "categories": ["World War II tanks of Japan", "Light tanks of Japan"], "title": "Type 4 Ke-Nu light tank"}

She achieved recognition for her efforts this year as she was selected as one of the finalists in the prestigious \"BRDC McLaren Autosport Young Driver of the Year Award\" and was selected as the \"BRDC Rising Star of the Year\".\n\nIn 2004, she competed in her third season in the Formula Renault UK Championship, this time racing for the Comtec Racing team and she finished 5th overall in the championship with 3 podium finishes during the year.\n\nFor 2005, Wolff made the step up to the British Formula 3 Championship to race for the Alan Docking Racing team in the Championship Class, but her season was disrupted by an ankle injury sustained during the winter. She also made a one-off appearance in the Porsche Carrera Cup GB at Brands Hatch in June.\n\nIn 2006, Wolff made the step up to compete in the DTM, the German Touring Car series, one of the biggest Touring Car championships in the world. She drove a 2004-spec Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe for the Mücke Motorsport team and was teammates with Stefan Mücke and Daniel la Rosa. In her debut season she achieved a best finish of 9th overall in the final round of the season at the Hockenheimring.\n\nIn 2007, Wolff remained in the DTM series, driving a 2005-spec Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe for the Mücke Motorsport team and was teammates with Mathias Lauda and Daniel La Rosa. Her best finish was at Mugello in Italy, where she finished in 10th place.\n\nIn the 2008 season, Wolff moved up to a 2007-spec car, and joined Persson Motorsport, where she drove alongside Mathias Lauda and Gary Paffett. Wolff's best performance of the year was at the Norisring in June, where she finished in 10th position.\n\nIn the 2009 DTM season, Wolff remained with Persson Motorsport in a 2008-spec car, alongside her teammate Jamie Green. In the first race of the season at the Hockenheimring, Wolff had to retire after 24 laps because of damage caused by a first-lap accident with Gary Paffett.\n\nOn 11 April 2012, Wolff was named as a development driver for the Williams Formula One team of which her husband Toto Wolff was already a shareholder. In 2014, Williams announced that Wolff would be driving in two free practice sessions at the British and German Grands Prix. At the British Grand Prix, Wolff became the first woman to participate in a Formula One weekend since 1992, when Giovanna Amati made three unsuccessful Grand Prix qualification attempts. However her time on the track was cut short after an engine problem occurred after completing just one timed lap. On 18 July 2014, Wolff drove in a free practice session at the German Grand Prix. This session also started with car problems, but these were solved and Wolff managed to put in a good performance, finishing the session in 15th place out of 22 cars with a time of 01:20.769 just two tenths of a second behind teammate Felipe Massa's 11th place time of 01:20.542. On 28 November 2014, Williams announced that Wolff would stay with team for the 2015 season in an enhanced role as test driver, with her position expanded to include two runs in Friday practice and two tests. In 2015, Wolff, who drove during pre-season F1 testing, clocked a 1:29.708 (14th place) in Friday's first free session of the Spanish Grand Prix, six places and 0.877s adrift of regular driver Felipe Massa (8th place with 01:28.831). She then managed to post a 1:37.242 in the free practice session at the British Grand Prix for a respectable 13th place out of 20 cars.\n\nOn 4 November 2015, Wolff announced on the BBC that she was retiring from Formula One racing, citing that she had always said that she would go when she felt that she could go no further; she felt that she had gone as far as she could go, but expressed intentions to help other women in motor racing. However, she stated that she would compete in the 2015 Race of Champions at the end of November for Scotland with former F1 driver David Coulthard and would subsequently retire from all forms of motorsport.\n\nWolff joined Mercedes as one of their ambassadors in 2016. \n\nIn 2018 Wolff joined the Venturi Formula E Team as Team Principal and also became a shareholder in the team.\n\nThe Race of Champions planned to feature a female driver for the first time in its history when Wolff signed up for ROC 2013, to be held at Bangkok's Rajamangala Stadium on 14–15 December. The news was warmly welcomed by ROC co-founder Michèle Mouton, the world's most successful female rally driver. However, in early December 2013, the event was cancelled due to the political situation in Bangkok.\n\nIn the 2014 event in Barbados, the Wolff–David Coulthard pair was able to compete as Team United Kingdom. The pair reached the finals of the Nations' Cup but lost to Team Nordic. Wolff lost to Tom Kristensen in the Audi R8 LMS Ultra while Coulthard won against Petter Solberg in the VW Polo RX, but lost the tie-breaker to Kristensen in the Ariel Atom Cup. In the Drivers' Cup, Wolff was eliminated in the group stage.\n\nOn 8 October 2013, Wolff was awarded an Honorary Fellowship at the University of Edinbugh \"in recognition of her role as an ambassador for women in sport\". She had interrupted her studies at Edinburgh's Business School in 2001 in order to turn professional. Wolff was honoured as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) on the 2017 New Year Honours list for services to Women in Sport.\n\n\n", "id": "7711491", "categories": ["1982 births", "Members of the Order of the British Empire", "Scottish female racing drivers", "British Formula Three Championship drivers", "People from Oban", "People educated at Oban High School", "Living people", "Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters drivers", "Scottish racing drivers", "McLaren Autosport BRDC Award nominees", "Karting World Championship drivers", "British Formula Renault 2.0 drivers", "Scottish expatriates in Switzerland"], "title": "Susie Wolff"}

His fiction was heavily influenced by his philosophical ideas, and he has been compared to Franz Kafka in this regard. He was the most influential and important Danish philosopher since Søren Kierkegaard.\n\nBorn in Copenhagen, Sørensen graduated from the Vestre Borgerdydskole in 1947, and then attended the University of Copenhagen and the University of Freiburg studying philosophy. Although he did not graduate, he later received an honorary degree from the University of Copenhagen.\n\nSørensen published his first collection of short stories, \"Strange Stories\" in 1953, which many critics have identified as being the start of Danish literary Modernism. He published additional collections of short stories in 1955 and 1964, all winning various awards in Denmark. These stories generally explored the absurd and hidden parts of the human psyche.\n\nSørensen began editing the journal \"Vindrosen\" (with Klaus Rifbjerg) in 1959. Afterward, he became a member of the Danish Academy in 1965, subsequently editing several other Modernist journals and periodicals. Sørensen, though he continued to produce short fiction throughout his life, was also deeply engaged in philosophy, about which he wrote many essays and several books including \"Seneca: The Humanist at the Court of Nero\" and his response to Søren Kierkegaard's \"Either/Or\", \"Hverken-eller\" (i.e. \"Neither/Nor\"). He also published books and essays about Nietzsche, Kafka, Marx, Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard, and was a notable translator of over 20 books. He was awarded the Grand Prize of the Danish Academy in 1962, The Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1974, the Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1983, the inaugural Swedish Academy Nordic Prize in 1986, along with many other awards and recognitions.

They are notable for being associated with the new wave of British heavy metal movement.\n\nThe band spent the first time after having formed writing material and rehearsing. After brief stints as \"Purgatory\" and \"Hellfire\" the members finally decided on naming the band \"Elixir\". According to the biography on the band's website the name was chosen through Steve Bentley closing his eyes and putting his finger on a word in a dictionary at random. In need of a vocalist Elixir recruited singer Sally Pike, but after recording a four song demo tape and playing two gigs together, she left the band by the end of the year. In 1984 Pike was replaced by Paul Taylor, and later the same year guitarist Norman Gordon joined the band to fill the vacant spot left by Steve Bentley, who departured after Elixir had completed their second demo tape.\n\nIn 1985, Elixir released their debut single \"Treachery (Ride like the Wind)\" / \"Winds of Time\". This single was reviewed by Ronnie James Dio in \"Kerrang!\" (No 99), and was given the thumbs up.\n\nIn 1986, the band recorded their first album \"The Son of Odin\". In issue 137 (November 2005) of Terrorizer magazine, the album was included in the top 20 power metal albums of all time, alongside Judas Priest's \"Painkiller\", Helloween's \"Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II\" and Cirith Ungol's \"King of the Dead\".\n\nElixir recorded their second album, initially called \"Sovereign Remedy\" in 1988 with Mark White on the bass and former Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr. Stevie Hughes replaced Burr for the band's live commitments through 1989. At the end of the year, Phil Denton quit the band and was replaced by Leon Lawson for several live shows before the band came off the road. Their second album was released by the Sonic label as \"Lethal Potion\" in 1990. In 2004, the album was re-released as \"Sovereign Remedy\" on the TPL label, as it was originally intended, with all the tracks, the original mix and new artwork.\n\nIn 2001 the band reverted to the Paul Taylor, Phil Denton, Norman Gordon, Kevin Dobbs and Nigel Dobbs line up and in 2003 recorded their third album \"The Idol\", which was made up of material the band had written in the 1980s.

His father was a serf bonded to the estate of Count Joseph Johann von Thun, but Stich was taught singing, violin and finally the horn. The Count sent him to study horn under Joseph Matiegka in Prague, Jan Schindelarz in Munich, and finally with A. J. Hampel in Dresden (from 1763 to 1764). Hampel first taught Stich the hand-stopping technique which he later improved and extended.\n\nStich then returned to the service of the Count, where he remained for the next four years. At the age of 20 Stich and four friends ran away from the estate. The Count, who had invested heavily in Stich's education, dispatched soldiers with orders to knock out Stich's front teeth to prevent him ever playing the horn again, but they failed to capture the group, and Stich crossed into Italy, into the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nOn arriving in Italy, Stich changed his name to Giovanni Punto (an approximate Italianisation of his name) and went to work in the orchestra of Josef Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. From there he moved to Mainz, to the court orchestra, but left after a few years when they did not give him the post of Konzertmeister. After this he began to travel and play as a soloist, touring much of Europe including England. Charles Burney heard him play in Koblenz in 1772, describing Punto as \"the celebrated French horn from Bohemia, whose taste and astonishing execution were lately so applauded in London\".\n\nPunto was particularly active in Paris, playing there 49 times between 1776 and 1788, but his use of hand-stopping was criticized by some in London, possibly due to the novelty of the technique. In 1777, he was invited to teach the horn players in the private orchestra of George III.\n\nPunto also composed pieces to demonstrate his own virtuosity (a common practice then), which indicate that he was a master of quick arpeggios and stepwise passagework.\n\nIn 1778 Punto met Mozart in Paris, after which Mozart reported to his father Leopold that \"Punto plays magnifique.\" The same year Punto probably entered into an arrangements with some Parisian publishers; nearly all his subsequent compositions were published in Paris, whereas they were previously listed in Breitkopf's catalogue. A new horn was also made for him in 1778, a silver \"cor solo\", which he used for the rest of his life.\n\nPunto sought a permanent position in which he could conduct as well as compose and play, and in 1781 he entered the service of Franz Ludwig von Erthal, the Prince-bishop of Würzburg, later moving to become the Konzertmeister (with a pension) for the Comte d’Artois (later to become Charles X of France) in Paris. He was successful enough in this role that in 1787 he was able to secure leave of absence and tour the Rhineland in his own coach, a mark of considerable wealth at the time.\n\nOn returning to Paris in 1789 Punto was appointed conductor of the Théâtre des Variétés Amusantes, where he remained for ten years, leaving in 1799 when he was not appointed to the staff of the newly founded Paris Conservatoire. Moving on to Vienna via Munich, Punto met Ludwig van Beethoven, who wrote his Op. 17 Sonata for Horn and Piano for the two of them. They premiered the work on 18 April 1800 at the Burgtheater and played the work again the following month in Pest, Hungary.\n\nIn 1801, Punto returned to his homeland after 33 years, playing a grand concert on 18 May in the National Theatre in Prague. A reviewer commented that Punto \"received enthusiastic applause for his concertos because of his unparalleled mastery, and respected musicians said that they had never before heard horn playing like it\". The reviewer commented on his innovative techniques, noting that \"in his cadenzas he produced many novel effects, playing two and even three-part chords\", and added that Punto was evidence that Bohemia was able to produce \"great artistic and musical geniuses\".\n\nIn 1802, after a short trip to Paris, Punto developed pleurisy, a common illness among wind players. He died five months later on 16 February 1803, being accorded a \"magnificent\" funeral in the Church of St. Nicholas attended by thousands. Mozart's Requiem was performed at the graveside.\n\nFranz Joseph Fröhlich wrote that \"what distinguished Punto, in a way that one has never heard in any other artist heretofore, was his most magnificent performance, the gentlest portrayals, the thunder of tones and their sweetest indescribable blending of nuances with the most varied tone production, an agile tongue, dexterous in all forms of articulation, single and double tones, and even chords, but most important, a silver-bright and charming cantabile tone.\"\n\nAmong his surviving compositions are:\n\n\n\n", "id": "7711669", "categories": ["Czech expatriates in Germany", "Czech classical composers", "Czech classical horn players", "Czech male classical composers", "18th-century classical musicians", "1803 deaths", "1746 births", "18th-century classical composers", "18th-century Bohemian people", "Czech classical musicians", "Czech expatriates in France"], "title": "Giovanni Punto"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7711708", "text": "Mail coach\n\nIn Great Britain, a mail coach was a stagecoach built to a Post Office-approved design operated by an independent contractor to carry long-distance mail for the Post Office. Mail was held in a box at the rear where the only Royal Mail employee, an armed guard, stood. Passengers were taken at a premium fare. There was seating for four passengers inside and more outside with the driver. The guard's seat could not be shared. This distribution system began in 1784. In Ireland the same service began in 1789.\n\nA mail coach service ran to an exact and demanding schedule. Aside from quick changes of horses the coach only stopped for collection and delivery of mail and never for the comfort of the passengers. To avoid a steep fine turnpike gates had to be open by the time the mail coach with its right of free passage passed through. The gatekeeper was warned by the sound of the posthorn.\n\nMail coaches were slowly phased out during the 1840s and 1850s, their role eventually replaced by trains as the railway network expanded.\n\nThe postal delivery service in Britain had existed in the same form for about 150 years - from its introduction in 1635, mounted carriers had ridden between \"posts\" where the postmaster would remove the letters for the local area before handing the remaining letters and any additions to the next rider. The riders were frequent targets for robbers, and the system was inefficient.\n\nJohn Palmer, a theatre owner from Bath, believed that the coach service he had previously run for transporting actors and materials between theatres could be utilised for a countrywide mail delivery service, so in 1782, he suggested to the Post Office in London that they take up the idea. He met resistance from officials who believed that the existing system could not be improved, but eventually the Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Pitt, allowed him to carry out an experimental run between Bristol and London. Under the old system the journey had taken up to 38 hours. The coach, funded by Palmer, left Bristol at 4pm on 2 August 1784 and arrived in London just 16 hours later.\n\nImpressed by the trial run, Pitt authorised the creation of new routes. By the end of 1785 there were services from London to Norwich, Liverpool, Leeds, Dover, Portsmouth, Poole, Exeter, Gloucester, Worcester, Holyhead and Carlisle. A service to Edinburgh was added the next year and Palmer was rewarded by being made Surveyor and Comptroller General of the Post Office.\n\nInitially the coach, horses and driver were all supplied by contractors. There was strong competition for the contracts as they provided a fixed regular income on top of which the companies could charge fares for the passengers. By the beginning of the 19th century the Post Office had their own fleet of coaches with black and maroon livery. The early coaches were poorly built, but in 1787 the Post Office adopted John Besant's improved and patented design, after which Besant, with his partner John Vidler, enjoyed a monopoly on the supply of coaches, and a virtual monopoly on their upkeep and servicing.\n\nThe mail coaches continued unchallenged until the 1830s but the development of railways spelt the end for the service. The first rail delivery between Liverpool and Manchester took place on 11 November 1830. By the early 1840s other rail lines had been constructed and many London-based mail coaches were starting to be withdrawn from service; the final service from London (to Norwich) was shut down in 1846. Regional mail coaches continued into the 1850s, but these too were eventually replaced by rail services.\n\nThe mail coaches were originally designed for a driver, seated outside, and up to four passengers inside. The guard (the only Post Office employee on the coach) travelled on the outside at the rear next to the mail box. Later a further passenger was allowed outside, sitting at the front next to the driver, and eventually a second row of seating was added behind him to allow two further passengers to sit outside. Travel could be uncomfortable as the coaches travelled on poor roads and passengers were obliged to dismount from the carriage when going up steep hills to spare the horses (as Charles Dickens describes at the beginning of \"A Tale of Two Cities\"). The coaches averaged 7 to 8 mph (11–13 km/h) in summer and about 5 mph (8 km/h) in winter but by the time of Queen Victoria the roads had improved enough to allow speeds of up to 10 mph (16 km/h). Fresh horses were supplied every 10 to 15 miles (16–24 km). Stops to collect mail were short and sometimes there would be no stops at all with the guard throwing the mail off the coach and snatching the new deliveries from the postmaster.\n\nThe cost of travelling by mail coach was about 1d. a mile more expensive than by private stage coach, but the coach was faster and, in general, less crowded and cleaner. Crowding was a common problem with private stage coaches, which led to them overturning; the limits on numbers of passengers and luggage prevented this occurring on the mail coaches. Travel on the mail coach was nearly always at night; as the roads were less busy the coach could make better speed.\n\nThe guard was heavily armed with a blunderbuss and two pistols and dressed in the Post Office livery of maroon and gold. The mail coaches were thus well defended against highwaymen, and accounts of robberies often confuse them with private stage coaches, though robberies did occur.\nTo prevent corruption and ensure good performance, the guards were paid handsomely and supplied with a generous pension. The mail was their sole charge, meaning that they had to deliver it on foot if a problem arose with the coach and, unlike the driver, they remained with the coach for the whole journey; occasionally guards froze to death from hypothermia in their exposed position outside the coach during the harsh winters (see River Thames frost fairs). The guard was supplied with a timepiece and a posthorn, the former to ensure the schedule was met, the latter to alert the post house to the imminent arrival of the coach and warn tollgate keepers to open the gate (mail coaches were exempt from stopping and paying tolls: a fine was payable if the coach was forced to stop). Since the coaches had right of way on the roads the horn was also used to advise other road users of their approach.\n\nA twice-weekly stage coach service operated between Dublin and Drogheda to the north, Kilkenny to the south and Athlone to the west as early as 1737 and for a short period from 1740, a Dublin to Belfast stage coach existed. In winter, this last route took three days, with overnight stops at Drogheda and Newry; in summer, travel time was reduced to two days.\n\nIn 1789, mail coaches began a scheduled service from Dublin to Belfast. They met the mail boats coming from Portpatrick in Scotland at Donaghadee, in County Down.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, most of the mail coaches in Ireland were eventually out-competed by Charles Bianconi's country-wide network of open carriages, before this system in turn succumbed to the railways.\n\nAustralia's first mail coach was established in 1828 and was crucial in connecting the remote settlements being established to the larger centres. The first mail contracts were issued and mail was transported by coach or on horseback from Sydney to the first seven country post offices – Penrith, Parramatta, Liverpool, Windsor, Campbelltown, Newcastle and Bathurst. The Sydney to Melbourne overland packhorse mail service was commenced in 1837. From 1855 the Sydney to Melbourne overland mail coach was supplanted by coastal steamer ship and rail. The rail network became the distributor of mail to larger regional centres there the mail coach met the trains and carried the mail to more remote towns and villages.\n\nIn 1863 contracts were awarded to the coaching company Cobb & Co to transport Royal Mail services within New South Wales and Victoria. These contracts and later others in Queensland continued until 1924 when the last service operated in western Queensland. The lucrative mail contracts helped Cobb & Co grow and become an efficient and vast network of coach services in eastern Australia.\n\nRoyal Mail coach services reached their peak in the later decades of the 19th century, operating over thousands of miles of eastern Australia. In 1870s Cobb & Co's Royal Mail coaches were operating some 6000 horses per day, and traveling 28,000 miles weekly carrying mail, gold, and general parcels.\n\nSome Concord stagecoaches were imported from the United States made in New Hampshire by the Abbot-Downing Company. This design was a 'thorough-brace' or 'jack' style coach characterized by an elegant curved lightweight body suspended on two large leather straps, which helped to isolate the passengers and driver from the jolts and bumps of the rough unmade country roads. Soon Australian coach builders using many of the Concord design features customized the design for Australian conditions.\n\n\n", "id": "7711708", "categories": ["Postal system", "Carriages", "Postal infrastructure in the United Kingdom"], "title": "Mail coach"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7711779", "text": "Arthur Allen Leff\n\nArthur Allen Leff (1935–1981) was a professor of law at Yale Law School who is best known for a series of articles examining whether there is such a thing as a normative law or morality. Leff answers this question in the negative and follows the consequences to their logical conclusions.\n\nLeff's first major work \"Economic Analysis of the Law: Some Realism About Nominalism\" is putatively a book review of Richard Posner's Economic Analysis of the Law. In actuality it is a critique of the use of any single methodology to provide normative rules for law and morality. The article is still, today, the main critique of Posner's work and economic analysis generally and is usually read in graduate seminars on Economic Analysis (though sometimes misidentified as the Legal Realist critique). Leff makes two fundamental propositions in \"Some Realism About Nominalism\": (1) that all models are only very limited views of the real world. When Posner views the world through the economic model much more is hidden than is revealed; (2) there is no system of logic for preferring one model (e.g. economic, social, political) over another unless an axiom is inserted early on into that system of logic. Leff notes that the opening of Posner's work does just that—inserts a proposition that rational economic behavior is to be preferred to other behavior. Leff follows his insight to its logical conclusion and notes that similarly there is no way, using logic, to prove that any particular act, no matter how horrible, is normatively wrong. Put it another way, one can never prove to another person that a particular set of behaviors is right or that a different set of behaviors is wrong. He states:\n\nLeff continues his critique of attempts to find normative rules in law and morality in \"Law and Technology: On shoring up a Void\", \"Unspeakable Ethics, Unnatural Law\" (alluding to the title of a collection of stories by Donald Barthelme), and his review of Robert Unger's \"Knowledge and Politics\" in the form of a letter from The Devil. In these works, Leff attempts to directly address whether a normative morality can exist without God. Leff answers the question in the negative. Leff states that absent an ultimate authority figure (i.e. God) handing down moral laws from on-high there is no reason for any person to prefer one set of behavior identified as \"moral\" to another. Leff terms this \"the Grand Sez Who.\" In particular, it is impossible to resolve the conflict between the rights of the individual and the power of the collective, even though much of the time we can pretend that, for instance, the Constitution tells us where to draw the line. There are bound to be cases where we are left on our own, with no authoritative referee; there is no \"brooding omnipresence in the sky\", in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., whom Leff quotes approvingly.\n\nIn \"Unspeakable Ethics, Unnatural Law\" Leff also criticizes the views of Robert Nozick and Roberto Unger, noting that for all their differences they end up with remarkably similar solutions to the problem of resolving differences among morally sovereign individuals: agglomerations of the like-minded, geographically separated. Leff claims that this move merely shifts the problem. Against Nozick, Leff states that his entire book, \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\", is built on the naked assertion that \"individuals have rights\", and that an entirely different yet equally valid argument could be built on the premise \"individuals have duties\". The arbitrary choice of starting point decides everything.\n\nLeff states as follows in the closing of \"Unspeakable Ethics, Unnatural Law\":\n\nIn \"Swindling and Selling\", Leff presented a wry analysis of the blurry lines between what we consider honest salesmanship and illegal fraud. Not all selling is swindling, but all swindling is selling, Leff explains. He shows how both sellers and swindlers have to overcome similar forms of buyer resistance. Leff explains these dynamics in the language of Erving Goffman and through some use of behavioral economics.\n\nIn the case of swindling, con artists weave a dramaturgy where they hold a monopoly over some valuable asset, and the mark is set up as monopsonist, an exclusive buyer with access to a special deal. The scheme is premised on mutual need, and policing of these schemes is difficult because for part of the transaction, the mark is a willing participant. Here, Leff describes scams such as the “Spanish Prisoner,” where a mark is promised great riches if he will only bribe some minor official to free the holder of the treasure (the modern version of this includes the “419” scheme). Leff then pans out to show how the elements of swindling are present in some political and religious movements (although these may not be scams). The “ancient estate” scam, where marks are convinced that a fantastic old property was improperly distributed, making many modern-day people claimants to it, is similar to political movements to repatriate lands. “Godcons” are con games where the “conman…induces one or more marks to trade money…of this world value in exchange for the promised delivery of quantities of exceedingly valuable divinely manufactured goods.” Pyramid schemes operate by distracting marks from the opportunity costs of their labor, and by getting them emotionally attached to a swindle instead of more viable employment.\n\nLeff then switches from “bunco” to legal selling. In a perfect market, bargains should not exist. Thus, sellers must create a plausible dramaturgy to explain why a buyer gets a bargain. This could be a clearance sale, with praises the buyer as parsimonious while implying that less careful consumers are getting the anti-bargain. Leff then turns to mass advertising, which relies upon several predicable cons: the “sufficiency switch” and the “Calvinist causation.” The former refers to the many products that suggest some cause and effect between the purchase of a product and some goal—clear up one’s complexion with a skin cream and get the girl. The latter is Leff’s term for positional objects: the Cadillac or the Mercedes. These things operate from an opposite logic. They do not make one successful, they license a script (and a prop) to the mark: “Buy this symbol with which you can advertise, powerfully and convincingly, that you are what you, and those about whose opinions you care, devoutly wish to be.\"\n\nLeff was an agnostic but his writings have been influential on Christian discussions of morality in the modern era. Phillip E. Johnson has suggested that Leff's work is really a critique of the God is dead argument. Johnson argues that the presence of evil in the world is evidence that there is an absolute morality which requires an absolute authority. Other Christian scholars have also applied Leff's critique to secular arguments for a normative morality. \n\nPosner has responded to Leff by stating that the purpose of any methodology or model is to simplify. Otherwise it would be impossible to achieve any kind of understanding of the real world.\n\nIn \"Grounding Normative Assertions: Arthur Leff’s Still Irrefutable, but Incomplete, Sez Who Critique\", 20 J. L. & Religion 31 (2004-2005), Washington and Lee University Law Professor Sam Calhoun agrees with Leff that attempts to ground secular, universal norms are doomed to fail. Calhoun argues, though, that Leff’s critique of moral norms is incomplete because Leff ignores a God-based morality. If God is introduced, normative assumptions can be securely grounded, although Calhoun acknowledges that looking to God for moral truth has many challenges.\n\nhttp://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/2814/\n\n\n", "id": "7711779", "categories": ["Yale Law School faculty", "American agnostics", "1935 births", "1981 deaths"], "title": "Arthur Allen Leff"}

Via the Hocking and Ohio Rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 116 square miles (300 km²) on the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau. Monday Creek has been badly affected by acid mine drainage.\n\nMonday Creek rises north of Shawnee in southern Perry County, and flows generally southwardly through northeastern Hocking County and northwestern Athens County, passing through the eastern part of Nelsonville to its confluence with the Hocking River about 2 miles (3 km) southeast of that city. Its largest tributaries are Little Monday Creek, 14.3 miles (23 km) long, which flows through Perry and Hocking Counties, and the Snow Fork, 10.7 miles (17.2 km) long, which rises in Perry County and flows through Hocking and Athens Counties, through the communities of Murray City and Buchtel.\nAs of 1994, land use in the Monday Creek watershed was occupied this way:\n\nThe Wayne National Forest owns 38% of land in the watershed; the largest private landowner is the Sunday Creek Mining Company.\n\nThe Adena, who lived in the region around 1000 BC, were the earliest known inhabitants of the Monday Creek area. Later native people of the region included the Lenape, Shawnee and Wyandot. According to legend, early European explorers of the region named the stream for the day on which it was discovered. The previous day the explorers had similarly named nearby Sunday Creek. The earliest white settlements in the area date to 1774; the Ohio Company purchased all the land in the watershed in two installments in 1787 and 1792.\n\nThe aggressive pursuit of natural resources, including coal, timber, salt, iron, and clay took its toll on the watershed from the mid-19th century until well into the 20th century. Iron production in the area aided the North during the Civil War. As much as 89% of the Monday Creek watershed was deforested by 1885, with replanting beginning with the establishment of the Wayne National Forest in 1935. Salt mining occurred in the watershed in the 19th century; clay brick production peaked in the early 20th century; oil and natural gas production began in 1909.\n\nThe earliest coal mines in the watershed can be traced to the 1860s. Early mines were underground, a practice which was in sharp decline by the 1920s and had ended completely in the watershed by 1991. Surface mining was begun post-World War II and declined in the 1970s. Coal in the watershed is primarily of the Middle Kittaning #6 variety, which is high in sulfur and has been identified by the Ohio EPA as having a high potential for pollution.\n\nThe Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has identified Monday Creek as having been \"irretrievably altered to the extent that no appreciable aquatic life can be supported\" due to severe contamination by acid mine drainage.\n\nThe Monday Creek Restoration Project, sponsored by Rural Action, has been working since 1994 to address water quality issues in the Monday Creek watershed.\n\n\n", "id": "7711820", "categories": ["Rivers of Hocking County, Ohio", "Rivers of Perry County, Ohio", "Rivers of Athens County, Ohio"], "title": "Monday Creek"}

The series was released in Japan during the height of the media franchise's popularity. By 1995, there were ten game releases, each with sales figures of about 200,000 to 300,000. By 1998, twenty games were released. They have never been released in any other country, with the exception of the \"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon\" game developed by Angel, which was released in France in 1994.\n\nSailor Moon (or Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon) is a beat 'em up video game developed by Angel in 1993, and ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was localized in Europe exclusively in French in 1994. A version for the Sega Mega Drive (known as the Genesis in North America) was developed and published by Ma-Ba, although certain elements were recycled from the Super NES version.\n\nThe game is set in the first series of \"Sailor Moon\", and the players take control of one or two of the five heroines. Each Sailor Soldier has some sequences of blows, three aerial attacks (neutral, moving forward/backward, downward) and a special charge-up projectile.\n\nThe enemies are the monsters of the Dark Kingdom that appeared in the anime, but if more than one of the same kind appears at once, the others use palette swaps.\n\nThe Mega Drive version features most of the stages from the Super NES version but a few were removed and replaced. Some of the boss battles are different as well, and a new hidden final boss, Queen Metallia is featured when playing on Hard Mode. The Mega Drive counterpart does not contain any of the music from the Super NES game, with the exception of the main theme song at the title screen. Bosses also has their own song rather than a generic theme for all of them. The game has different endings for each playable character.\nSailor Moon R is the sequel to the first \"Sailor Moon\" and introduced a new playable character, Chibiusa. The sprites from the previous game were redesigned with more detail and more animation frames for this game and the later games. \n\nLike the Mega Drive version of the previous game, the bosses have their own theme music. By playing the game on hard mode, there is a minor change to the ending that involves Sailor Pluto. Monsters in this game were all droids. Like the previous game, there are several different shades of them. One of the other differences from the first game is the special attack that destroys all on-screen enemies.\nBishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Jougai Rantou!? Shuyaku Soudatsusen is a fighting game developed by Arc System Works and published by Angel and released on December 16, 1994.\n\nThe game features three game modes: A single-player plot-based Story mode, as well as a Tournament mode and 2-Player Versus mode where all the Sailor Soldiers are able to be selected including the Outer Soldiers. Sailor Saturn is the only Soldier not featured in the game.\nPretty Soldier Sailor Moon S is a 2D fighting game for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, featuring nine Sailor Soldiers (Sailor Saturn is not present) and based on Sailor Moon S season. Each Soldier has a set of special attacks. Virtual camera is zooming during battle, approaching the fighters and retreating from them. Opening intro combines sprite and 3D animation.\n\nPretty Soldier Sailor Moon (or Sailor Moon Arcade) is a beat 'em up video game developed by Gazelle (one of the offshoots of shooter developer Toaplan) and published by Banpresto in March 1995 and released only in Japan. The game has been described as a beat 'em up inspired by Capcom's \"Final Fight\".\nBishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Another Story is an RPG. In battle, compatible Sailor Soldiers (2 or 3) can use \"Link Techniques\", which are unique team up attacks with various effects, be they offensive, healing, or defensive.\n\nEP (energy points) regenerate after each battle. The storyline of the RPG is fairly linear. All ten members of the Sailor Soldiers are playable. Only five members of the team can be in the player's party at one time. For a good part of the game, the storyline dictates which Soldiers are playable, however further into the game the player may choose which Soldiers are in the party (though certain Soldiers are still required to be in the party at certain points).\n\nThe game is set between the third and fourth story arcs and combines original elements with elements from both the anime and manga. Throughout the game, the player can also collect puzzle pieces which make an image of the Soldiers and Tuxedo Mask. If the puzzle is completed, there is a reward at the end.\n\nIn \"Another Story\", a sorceress named Apsu arrives from the 30th century. She has formed a group of girls from Crystal Tokyo known as the Opposito Soldiers and ordered them to alter the past in order to change the future to her liking, with the ultimate goal of attaining the Silver Crystal. Apsu and her followers succeed in changing the fates of the defeated villains from the first three story arcs, bringing deceased villains back to life and turning reformed and healed individuals back to the darkness.\n\nWith the advice of the ghosts of the Four Kings of Heaven, the Soldiers set out to regain the Barazuishou (\"Rose Crystal\"), Tuxedo Mask's stone (which replaces the Golden Crystal in the game) in order to change Sailor Moon's destiny back and to save Crystal Tokyo.\n\nThe game has two endings. If the player loses to the final boss, Chibiusa and the remaining Soldiers will fight a slightly easier form of it and the player will receive the \"bad\" ending.\n\nBishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Zenin Sanka!! Shuyaku Soudatsusen is a 2D fighting game for the Super Famicom based upon the Sailor Moon Super S season. In story mode five Guardian Soldiers and Chibimoon are available.

However, in story mode, players can only choose from the six main Soldiers. All six major Soldiers now have four specials techniques, three power attacks, and their new power from the show. The four other Soldiers only have three powers available to them.\n\nPlayers can also customize characters, by assigning up to 20 points to increase the attributes of each of the characters. The game offers four levels of difficulty, ranging from Easy to Hardest.\n\nQuiz Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Chiryoku Tairyoku Toki no Un is a quiz game developed by Gazelle (one of the offshoots of shooter developer Toaplan) and released by Banpresto in 1997.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7711850", "text": "List of EastEnders two-hander episodes\n\n\"EastEnders\" two-hander episodes refers to singular episodes of the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\" that feature only two members of the cast for the duration. Scripted like mini-plays, two-hander episodes have become a tradition in \"EastEnders\" over the years, dating back to a groundbreaking episode in 1986, which featured publicans Den Watts and Angie Watts. Devoting an entire half an hour of drama to just two characters had previously been unheard of in a bi-weekly serial before this episode aired, but it set a precedent for the programme and it has featured two-handers ever since.\n\nTypically the episodes feature revelations and major character changes to an important relationship, and intense interactions between two prominent characters. Structuring the episode in this way allows for in-depth focus on a specific character/storyline that would be impossible to achieve in the fast-moving and rapidly cut regular episodes. It also relies on just the one story and two actors to hold the audience for the entire duration of the episode.\n\nPractically, these episodes were originally created for speedy filming purposes, as while the two actors were filming the two-hander, the remaining cast could be filming another episode.\n\nThe first two-hander features Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) and is structured like a tennis match, with a non-speaking window cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. The episode is written by Jane Hollowood and directed by Antonia Bird. This episode was watched by 14.0 million viewers in its original broadcast. Writers chose to give Den and Angie a two-hander episode due to their popularity.\n\nDen and Angie's marriage has broken down, and before the episode, Den finally decides to end the marriage and leave Angie for his mistress, Jan Hammond (Jane How). The episode begins with Den trying to talk to Angie to tell her that he wants to leave her and get a divorce. Angie stalls but Den persists and explains to her that he wants a clean break from her, their pub, The Queen Victoria, Albert Square and Walford. Den tells Angie that he shall get another pub through a deal with James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde) and Jan would be doing the books. Angie is shocked and feels defeated, but she then reveals that she is terminally ill with only six months to live. Den does not believe her, but Angie explains her story to Den; Angie's hysterical performance eventually convinces him. Den crumbles and promises to stay with her, adding that he will kill Angie if she is lying. Consumed by guilt, Den asks Angie for her forgiveness. As Den leaves Angie alone and takes their dog Roly for a walk, she gives a deranged smile, revealing that she has been lying to Den.\n\nThe second two-hander features old friends Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), who are babysitting Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry) one rainy afternoon. This episode centres around nostalgia and growing old and was scripted to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Dot and Ethel. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by Mike Gibbon, a future producer of the show.\n\nWhile baby Vicki sleeps, Dot and Ethel reminisce about their lives during World War II and share secrets from their girlhoods. During the war Ethel was 17 and remained in London where she witnessed the death of her family, who were killed by a German doodlebug. Dot was evacuated to Wales when she was three years old and stayed with a couple she called Auntie Gwen (Eve Miles) and Uncle Will (Daffyd Emyr), who wanted to adopt her. Dot later confessed that she had an abortion soon after she married Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) because he told her he would leave her if she kept the baby. This caused a furious Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton) to punch Charlie on the nose in The Queen Victoria pub. Towards the end of the episode Dot goes out to the shop for a loaf bread and some fig rolls. When she returns Ethel is asleep and Dot thinks she has died and begins weeping and reciting the Lord's Prayer. When Ethel rouses, Dot panics and Ethel has to slap her out of it. Ethel then tearfully reminisces about her dead husband William (Ian Brimble) and the past. As the episode ends, Dot and Ethel tend to Vicki while singing.\n\nThe third two-hander featured the best friends Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). In the aftermath of Sharon's father's death, the two friends started an evening at home with a bottle of wine and their memories. This episode was written by Tony McHale and directed by Mike Gibbon.\n\nAfter Den Watts's (Leslie Grantham) supposed murder, Sharon - his adoptive daughter - began to speculate about the identity of the mysterious woman who had been seen with him prior to his death. When Sharon told Michelle that she felt that she and her daughter Vicki Fowler (Samantha Leigh Martin) were now her family, Michelle blurted out a secret that she'd been keeping for over 3 years - that Den was Vicki's father and she was the mystery woman who was seen with Den before his death. Michelle thought Sharon would be comforted to know that she was, in a sense, Vicki's sister, and that a part of Den lived on in Vicki. However, Sharon took the news very badly, feeling hurt, angry and deceived. After slapping Michelle and having an emotional showdown, Sharon left their flat wishing that Michelle had never told her.\n\nThis episode featured the Mitchell brothers, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp). Following Grant's discovery that Phil had slept with his wife, Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), Grant had beaten Phil so badly that he was hospitalised with a dangerous blood clot to the brain. Phil was rushed into surgery, and the clot was removed. As Grant sat with his brother, the two made a pact and promised that they would never let a woman come between them again.\n\nAs Phil awoke from his surgery he found his brother sleeping next to him, holding his hand. Grant awoke and instantly got defensive claiming that he was only there because their friend Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley) had persuaded him. As the two started talking Grant started to reminisce about the past when a girl he was dating came onto Phil and he told him. He asked him if that's what it was like with Sharon. Did she come onto him? And why didn't he tell him? Phil told him it wasn't like that, but Grant kept on calling Sharon a slut and blaming her for the whole affair. He was angry with himself for marrying a slapper. Phil tried to tell him that Sharon wasn't a slut, but his protests fell on deaf ears. Grant proceeded to ask Phil how easy Sharon was to pull. He wouldn't answer, but Grant persisted saying that he never used to be so bashful. After continual pestering Phil began to get agitated and told Grant that Sharon was easy and he didn't even have to get out of first gear.\n\nThey then began to talk about their relationship, how people used to hate them because they were so close and could do anything together and this was always Sharon's problem. After they reminisced about their many conquests with women Grant returned to the topic of Sharon. He was planning to crush her \"like a table tennis ball\" and make her pay for what she'd done. Phil warned him not to do anything stupid, which angered Grant and he accused him of sticking up for Sharon, but Phil assured him he was merely concerned for his welfare. He persuaded Grant that if the two of them didn't stick together, Grant would end up back in prison. He promised Grant that he'd do anything for him and as Grant began to weep Phil promised that from now on, it will be just the two of them.\n\nThis episode featured Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement) and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Peggy was on the warpath after being told about a fabricated affair between her fiancé Frank (Mike Reid) and his ex-wife Pat. However Pat had other concerns. Her husband, Roy Evans (Tony Caunter), had driven off like a suicidal maniac nearly hitting her in the process. As Frank sped off after Roy, Pat and Peggy waited it out in the Evans household and made their feelings to each other clear.\n\nPat was in shock about Roy nearly hitting her, but convinced herself that he merely didn't see her. Peggy was not so sure and commented that running her down was cheaper than divorce, and suggested that Roy had also found out about her affair. Pat insisted that nothing happened between her and Frank, but Peggy took a lot of convincing, and they both traded insults at each other. Pat told Peggy that Frank talked about her a lot, but Peggy couldn't accept this and when Pat left the room for a bath, Peggy began to sob. Pat eventually joined her and Peggy accused her of still loving Frank. Pat didn't quite deny it, but said she has moved on and knows when to give up on something. Peggy was convinced that Frank had feelings for Pat too.\n\nAfter opening a bottle of wine Pat began to feel sorry for herself, saying that she was cursed and turned rich, happy men into disasters - Roy was broke and impotent, whereas Frank who has spent a couple of years away from her, was back to his old virile self. Peggy was amazed to discover that Roy was impotent and Pat was quick to point out that sex wasn't important and she was happy to have finally found a man who wanted her to settle down.\n\nAfter the police arrived to inform Pat that their search for Roy had been fruitless, Peggy pestered them for some information, which made her suspect that Roy had come to harm. Now feeling more sympathetic Peggy went to converse with Pat, but the atmosphere soon became frosty once again when each began to recount their wonderful times with Frank. Pat stuck the knife in further by saying that she could have slept with Frank if she'd wanted to the night before, he still fancied her and the least encouragement would have sufficed. The bitching continued with Pat branding Peggy \"mutton dressed as lamb\" and Peggy blaming Pat's appearance for Roy's impotence. Their rowing finally descended into violence as both ladies threw wine glasses at each other and then a fight started when Peggy grabbed the edge of the kitchen table and threw it over to clear the way to attack Pat. The episode ended with Pat slapping Peggy, saying \"YOU BITCH!\" and Peggy slapping Pat right back, exclaiming \"YOU COW!\", right before the doorbell rang.\n\nOccurring simultaneously to the Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement) and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) two-hander described above, this episode featured Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) and Frank Butcher (Mike Reid). After Roy sped off nearly hitting Pat with his car, Frank followed him and forced him to rethink a drastic decision.\n\nFrank followed Roy's car as he sped off extremely erratically. Eventually Roy turned into a multi-storey car park, drove to the top and crashed the car into some rubble. He then made his way to the roof, and stood on the edge contemplating suicide. Frank followed and tried to persuade him to get down, saying he should think about his family, who will blame themselves and about Pat who thinks that he tried to kill her earlier. Roy claimed that he didn't see her, but added that it was all hopeless and he had lost everything, so there was no point living. Frank pointed out that he had a family who loved him and money was not important. Frank eventually persuaded him to come down to talk, promising that if he felt the same afterwards, he would bring him back and not stop him from taking his own life. Roy agreed and the two of them went to a strip club and ordered a couple of brandies. Roy continued to explain the reason for his depression. He had been conned in a car deal and was facing bankruptcy. Frank told Roy that they had more in common than he might think, as he once tried to commit suicide too, was left bankrupt and he made the mistake of not going back to Pat then, but for Roy it wasn't too late.\n\nRoy felt that Pat was still in love with Frank, and then accidentally let slip about his impotency, which only humiliated him further. Frank was understanding and promised he wouldn't tell anyone, and he in turn shared a story with Roy, relaying that he had fathered a child with some young girl he met when he had his breakdown, and no one else knew. Roy was comforted to know that Frank had skeletons in his closet too, and eventually agreed to go home. Frank drove them back, they rang the bell at the Evanses just as Peggy and Pat's fight was in full flow. Pat was thrilled to see Roy, and Peggy a little less thrilled to see Frank, so he asked her if they were still engaged. She responded \"Just\".\n\nThis episode featured Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom). Steve had let Matthew serve time in prison for Saskia Duncan's (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) murder. Upon his release Matthew came to Walford looking for revenge. 19.8 million viewers watched this episode.\n\nWhen Matthew turned up at e20 nightclub Steve was shocked by the visible transformation and could see that Matthew was seeking revenge. Matthew produced a video - he had rigged Steve's flat with booby traps and Steve knew it was only a matter of time before his sister Jackie Owen (Race Davies) arrived home to trigger them. Matthew demanded £10,000. Steve tried to gain the upper hand by pulling his gun from the safe, but Matthew was one step ahead and had already removed the bullets. As they struggled Matthew grabbed a bottle and knocked Steve unconscious. He then tied and bound him to the chair.\n\nWhen Steve came to he tried to use a piece of smashed bottle to free himself, and managed to grab hold of the gun Matthew was waving in his face. He demanded that Matthew remove the booby traps from his flat. However Matthew stopped Steve in his tracks by revealing that he had killed Saskia's sister, Claudia (Romla Walker), and framed him for the deed, just as he had done to him. Steve buckled and fell to the floor, unable to take in what was happening. He began to beg and cry, whilst Matthew splattered petrol around the room and then pulled a zippo lighter from his pocket. As he lit the lighter and dropped it to the floor Steve was gripped with fear. However he soon realised that there was no fire or smoke. Matthew had used water instead of petrol and had invented the whole scenario to belittle him and watch him beg for mercy.\n\nThis episode featured Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and his long-time employer Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). After losing his wife, son, and finally his mind Ricky said an emotional farewell to the Square, and Phil tried to talk him out of leaving.\n\nRicky had sped out of Walford in his car and been involved in an accident. Phil went after him and passed the police retrieving the wreck of Ricky's car. They told him to go to the police station. Phil arrived and Ricky appeared - he had been caught over the limit doing when he crashed.\n\nRicky was furious with Phil for allowing him to work on dodgy motors at The Arches, and was even more annoyed when he discovered that the car he had totalled was stolen. Ricky threatened to go back to the station to tell the police everything. Phil forced him to get into the car, but whilst he was being driven away he told Phil that he was not going home, and started fighting with Phil in order to get him to stop. The car swerved dangerously and Phil was forced to stop at the next service station.\n\nPhil tried to explain the situation with the car-scam, saying that he only got involved to bail Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) out and it was just a favour. Ricky was furious that he could have been jailed for helping Phil. Ricky felt that there was nothing to go back to Walford for. He had lost his wife and son and was devastated that Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) was seeing another man. Ricky was also hurt because he had trusted Phil - he was the only thing that held him together over the last few weeks, but now he could no longer trust him. As he went to leave Phil chased him and tried to stop him leaving. However Ricky refused to let Phil push him around and informed Phil that he had purposefully driven his car into the back of the truck. Phil tried to reason that he had also lost his family. He had managed to turn his life around and Ricky could do the same. Phil tried to make Ricky think of the ramifications of his departure - Pat would dump Roy, Frank would go mad and run away again, and Phil would be dumped in it with the police. Ricky didn't care and as he began to walk off Phil shouted after him that everyone needs him to stay, and he was Ricky's friend and was there for him when he found out his unborn baby had spina bifida. The memory stirred up buried emotions in Ricky, and as he burst into tears Phil embraced him.\n\nAs dawn began to break Phil tried to coerce Ricky home by offering him partnership in The Arches. He promised to take the rap for the dodgy motor that Ricky was driving and to sort out his nemesis Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for him. Phil apologised for all the things he'd done to Ricky in the past, but wanted the chance to make it up to him, and turn things around. Ricky begrudgingly accepted, but when Phil left briefly to make a quick phone call Ricky decided that he couldn't return to Walford. While Phil's back was turned he asked a lorry driver for a lift and departed.\n\nThis episode features Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her daughter Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), who up until this moment has lived her life thinking that Kat is her sister. In the previous episode, Zoe announces that she is leaving Walford to live with her uncle, Harry Slater (Michael Elphick), in Spain, but Kat is adamant that she will not. A screaming row in the street ensues and Zoe shouts \"You can't tell me what to do, you ain't my mother!\", to which Kat's desperate reply is, \"Yes I am!\". 16.9 million viewers tuned in for this episode.\n\nThis episode began with Zoe still reeling from Kat's outburst. Back at the Slaters', Zoe demanded to know what Kat meant. Kat tried to take back what she had said, but after continuous pestering, she finally relented and admitted that what she said was the truth. This devastated Zoe, and while she locked herself in her room distraught, Kat sat outside and began to explain the reason for the deception. She had fallen pregnant when she was 13, and her parents, disappointed and ashamed, forced her to hand Zoe over to them at birth. They proceeded to bring her up as their own child. Kat relayed her heartache at having to watch her own child being brought up by her parents, and the anxiety she felt at having to pretend that she was her sister for her whole life. The lies and deception were too much for Zoe, and when she discovered that Kat had wanted to abort her, the two lashed out at each other in fury.\n\nThe news made Zoe all the more determined to live with her uncle Harry in Spain, and upon hearing this Kat dropped her second bombshell - she couldn't go and live with Harry because he was her father. Kat's uncle had sexually abused her as a child, leaving her pregnant with Zoe. This meant that Zoe's father was simultaneously her great uncle.\n\nThis episode featured Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) and her step-grandmother Dot Branning (June Brown). Sonia had kidnapped the daughter she had given up for adoption and was keeping her hidden away at the Brannings'. Dot tried to reason with Sonia and shared a secret of her own.\n\nWith Rebecca Miller asleep upstairs, Sonia ransacked the house for money in order to make her getaway. Dot frantically knocked at the door, shouting that Rebecca's adoptive parents, Neil Miller (Robin Sneller) and Sue Miller (Victoria Willing), were going to call the police unless Sonia let her in. Sonia tried to deny Rebecca was there, but Dot knew otherwise and made it clear that she was there to retrieve the baby for the Millers. Sonia became distressed by this, arguing that as she was Rebecca's mother she can look after her. The Millers had given Dot a deadline, she had 15 minutes to persuade Sonia to surrender Rebecca or they would involve the police.\n\nSonia tried to explain herself. The Millers had planned to take Rebecca away without granting her a last visit. She was also upset at how much her baby had changed since she was born and she had decided that she wanted her back. Dot argued that she couldn't change her mind now that Rebecca had been adopted and she no longer had any rights as her mother. When Dot instructed Sonia to take Rebecca outside, she threatened to abscond with the baby. She begged Dot to stall the police so she could escape via the back door and was furious when Dot refused. Dot proceeded to point out that Sonia had missed out on 18 months of Rebecca's life and that she hardly knew her daughter now. Despite her pleas, Dot refused to help Sonia - and threatened to call the police herself if the kidnapping continued.\n\nSonia became inconsolable. Dot tried to reassure her that everything would be alright, she just needed some inner strength. Sonia became angry with Dot for living her life by the Bible and Dot was mortified when she threw the holy book across the room. Sonia wondered why Dot was so willing to help her criminal son Nick Cotton (John Altman), but wouldn't help her. Dot explained that she helped Nick because she had something to make up for. She had an abortion when she was 21 years old. Her husband Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) had forced her to terminate the pregnancy against her wishes. Dot described how guilty she felt after the abortion. She thought she had put it all behind her until the christening gown was found buried in the garden of Mark Fowler's (Todd Carty) house. She wished she had kept the baby, now she's left feeling cold and empty. Sonia wondered whether she should have been a single mum like her own mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson). She relayed that Carol was furious about the adoption, but Dot reassured her that Rebecca would have a good life with the Millers.\n\nJust as the Millers decided to call the police, Rebecca began to cry. When Sonia was unable to console her she finally realised that it was time to give her up. Tearfully, she passed Rebecca over to her relieved parents.\n\nThis episode featured the ex-lovers Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). Sharon and Phil had a heart to heart about their troubled pasts. They laid ghosts to rest and agreed to move on with their lives.\n\nSharon and Phil were simultaneously having problems in their relationships. Sharon had fallen out with Tom Banks (Colm Ó Maonlaí), due to malicious stirring from his ex-wife Sadie, and Phil had given Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) an ultimatum - she was to leave her husband Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) before the day was over. As Phil waited for Lisa to arrive in the middle of the night, he heard a knock at the door of The Queen Vic. He opened the door expecting to find Lisa, but found Sharon instead.\n\nSharon declared that she and Tom were over. Phil accused her of being stroppy and spoilt and she retaliated by accusing him of using Lisa so he could get his hands on their daughter, Louise Mitchell (Rachel Cox). The ex-lovers began drinking and flirting and talked about their past relationship. As they talked Phil relaxed and opened up about his father. Phil relayed how he idolised his father but that all changed when he saw how badly he treated his mother. He admitted that his deepest wish was to be a good father and expressed his sorrow that his two children were living with other men. Phil began to shake with emotion as he recalled the beatings he received from his father, whilst his brother Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) could do no wrong. After one horrific Christmas, Phil vowed to run away and he still carried the note he was going to leave his parents. He never did run away, but the violence continued until he was big enough to fight back. Sharon had also had issues with her parents. She loved them both, but was caught in the middle of their volatile marriage. After they rowed, they used to compete with each other for her affections.\n\nSharon then realised that they both had to stop living in the past. She decided to sell her share in The Vic as it reminded her of her parents and Grant. Phil agreed to buy her out. Sharon then urged Phil to put his troubled relationship with his father behind him. Their heart to heart helped her to realise that she wanted to make a go of things with Tom. As Sharon left, Phil took the note that he wrote when he was a boy out of his pocket. He set it on fire to signify that it was time for him to move on too.\n\nThis episode featured Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth) and her abusive husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). It was the night of Little Mo and Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) engagement party. Trevor snatched Little Mo from the party at \"Angie's Den\" and imprisoned her in the Slater house. To make matters worse, Trevor's baby son Sean was his other hostage.\n\nTrevor had imprisoned Little Mo in the Slater house. He called her stupid for believing he'd ever grant her a divorce. Ominously, he reminded her of their marriage vows - including \"till death us do part\". Trevor began to weep as he admitted he was totally obsessed with Little Mo. He was furious that she had been unfaithful to him with Billy and reminded her that she will always be his. Little Mo was disgusted and wondered how Trevor had ended up in such a pitiful state. The early years of their marriage had been happy - so why did Trevor start beating her? He explained that he couldn't stand sharing her and resented the time she spent caring for her sick mother. He never liked Viv, and was glad when she died. Trevor raged that it wasn't enough for him to be part of her family, he wanted to be all of it.\n\nTrevor then turned violent, pushed Little Mo against the wall and reminded her that he'd kill her if she ever slept with another man. Terrified, Little Mo tried to escape but found that all the doors were locked. She ran upstairs in a panic, but Trevor followed and threw her to the ground saying that she will never hurt him again. Half-crazed with anger, Trevor barked questions at Little Mo, forcing her to admit that it was morally wrong for her, as his wife, to sleep with another man. He claimed that Billy couldn't possibly love her like he did. His questions took on an intimate nature and as he made a move towards Little Mo she recoiled in fear, but Trevor then declared there was no time for that, he had other plans for her. After calmly leaving the room, Little Mo followed to find Trevor pouring petrol on the stairs and suddenly she heard baby Sean crying upstairs. Out of desperation, Little Mo claimed that she still loved Trevor and she had never wanted a divorce. Thinking fast, she blamed Billy for turning her against him. She tore off her engagement ring and threw it away. Trevor slumped to the ground, eager to believe that she still loved him. Little Mo beckoned to him and they embraced. As she cradled him in her arms he sobbed that he never meant to hurt her.\n\nLittle Mo suggested they go away together, but that she first needed to return Sean to his mother. When Trevor tried to get romantic, Little Mo shrieked and shook him off. Realising that he was being fooled, Trevor turned violent and Little Mo froze with fear, but seeing Billy's ring on the carpet gave her courage. She stared at Trevor and proclaimed that she wasn't frightened of him anymore. She told him that she could see him for what he was - a coward and a bully. Shocked at her defiance, Trevor whispered that she should be scared, but Little Mo was defiant and told him that he didn't have the guts to go through with his threat. She lit a match forcing an alarmed Trevor to grab it from her. In his haste the match fell to the floor and flames began to fill the room, Trevor was killed though Little Mo and the baby survived.\n\nThis episode featured Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) and her ex-boyfriend Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) in flashbacks to October 2002 while Phil recounts the events to Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny). After Lisa abducted Phil's daughter and fled to Portugal, Phil tracked her down and was adamant that he was returning to Walford with his daughter. \n\nAfter fleeing from Phil, Lisa was trapped at the edge of a cliff grasping her daughter, Louise Mitchell (Rachel Cox). Phil implored her to move away from the cliff edge, but Lisa was terrified and yelled at Phil to get away from her. Phil stepped back and urged Lisa to consider Louise's safety and slowly, Lisa moved away from the edge.\n\nLisa saw a man walking his dog and shouted in vain for help. Her yelling made Louise cry and Lisa tried to calm her with a lullaby. Phil was biding his time and refused to leave without Louise. Lisa finally began to calm down so Phil led to her to an abandoned cottage so they could talk. As they settled inside Phil remarked how beautiful his daughter was, and paid the same compliment to Lisa. He told Lisa that he missed them both so much. Lisa was suspicious, but after continual pressure she allowed Phil to hold Louise.\n\nPhil tried to persuade Lisa that children need their fathers', and whilst Lisa admitted that she missed her own father she insisted that neither of them were going back with Phil. Phil tried to keep her talking, he questioned her about her father. Lisa confessed that she had a recurring dream involving her dad. As she recalled the dream, she becomes highly distraught and informed him that it involved coffins and babies. Phil found this disturbing and did his best to convince Lisa that she wasn't well. He offered to arrange the professional help that she obviously needed, but Lisa accused Phil of trying to trap her into returning to England. Phil immediately got defensive, he continued his mind games and managed to make Lisa consider that a life in Portugal, with an unskilled, jobless mother was not appropriate for their daughter. Phil fired question after question at Lisa, and the continual probing began to baffle Lisa. As he saw it, she had no money and no plans. It was not enough to merely love her daughter if she couldn't provide for her. He told her that babies need stability and their first year was hugely important. Lisa had moved from man to man, and from one place to another in that time. Distressed, Lisa put her hands over her ears, whilst Phil continued to rant that she was not fit to look after a dog let alone a baby! He declared that Lisa was mentally unstable and Lou was not safe with her. Phil urged Lisa to do what was best for her baby.\n\nExhausted by Phil's personal attacks, Lisa fell quiet. Phil then stated calmly that if she tried to stop him taking Louise, he'd have her committed. Lisa protested that the only mad thing she had ever done was get involved with him, but Phil proceeded to plants doubts in her mind. He reminded her that she shot him and left him for dead and asked if that was how a sane person behaved. Lisa was visibly distressed and shaking. Sensing that the moment was right, Phil ordered her to fetch Louise and hand her over to him. Bewildered, Lisa obeyed him. He then announced that it was best if Lisa didn't ever try to return to Walford. He was prepared to reveal all about the shooting if she did.\n\nLisa staggered outside in confusion and grief. Phil ignored her howls of anguish and walked away with Louise whilst Lisa stared over the edge of the cliff.\n\nThis episode reunited Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) with his adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), after she'd spent 14 years thinking that he was dead. Sharon had the shock of her life when her dad emerged from the shadows and muttered \"Hello, Princess!\". Sharon couldn't believe that her dad was still alive. Den did his best to explain where he'd been, but Sharon was torn between delight and anger.\n\nSharon touched Den, dumbstruck to see her dad after all these years, but before she had a chance to take it in she began to feel nauseous and ran to the toilet to be violently sick. Upon her return, Den proceeded to try to explain himself. Sharon stared in disbelief and wanted to know how he could let her think that he was dead all this time. As emotions began to run high, Sharon revealed that she'd never stopped grieving for him. Den explained that he couldn't take the risk in contacting her, or they would have both been in danger. Den only felt safe to return to Walford after hearing that Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett) - a gangster associated with his attempted murder - had died. He apologised to Sharon for never having the guts to get in touch. Sharon sobbed as she recalled the last conversation she ever had with him. She washed her hands of him, and the next thing she knew he was dead. She'd regretted her harsh words ever since, she thought he'd died thinking that she hated him. Sharon confessed that she'd made a mess of her life. Things would have been easier if he'd been around. Just his voice on the end of the phone would have helped. Den had tears in his eyes as he hugged Sharon.\n\nAs the two began to bond, Den brought the conversation round to his first wife, Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) and offended Sharon by referring to her as a \"barmy old lush\". Sharon announced that Angie had died. Den didn't even know. Furious, Sharon then decided it was too late for Den to make amends, and yelled at him to leave her alone. Den did as she wanted and wandered though the Square, before breaking into The Vic, the pub he used to own. Den surveyed the pub and Sharon followed him inside. They drank a toast to Angie and Sharon revealed how she nursed her mum during the painful final days of her fatal illness. Den reflected that he had some good times in the pub, but Sharon couldn't remember many good times – she just recalled her parents' furious rows. She mentioned how she once ran it with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), whom Den had never even heard of. Sharon then remembered that she had an axe to grind with her father, for getting her best friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) pregnant when she was only 16. Den tried to explain what happened between him and Michelle, but Sharon was furious with him for cheating on her mother and blamed him for sending her to an early grave.\n\nSharon decided that she wasn't going to allow Den to ruin her life again. Den tried to calm her, but she insisted that she, Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson) and Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) didn't need him. Den assumed that Dennis was Sharon's boyfriend and told her he wasn't important. Then Sharon revealed that he wasn't her boyfriend, Dennis was his son.\n\nThis episode featured Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman). Father and son went head to head in The Vic. Both were desperate to win the battle. It ended with violence, and one being the definite loser.\n\nDen had just discovered that his adopted daughter, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), was sleeping with his son. He was not happy. In The Vic, Den took Dennis aside for a chat. Dennis sat down with trepidation but was amazed that Den was so calm. He explained that he and Sharon were in love, but Den had doubts. With Dennis showing no signs of budging, Den reluctantly decided to that Dennis had to be forced away from Sharon rather than persuaded. When Dennis referred to their bonding chat last Christmas and that he was glad that Den now knew about him and Sharon, Den mocked him cruelly, claiming that their prior bonding was all an act. He was only pretending when he acted fatherly towards him and didn't care about him in the slightest. Dennis was hurt and taken aback and as Den belittled him further, remembering the way Dennis melted when he called him \"son\", Dennis became enraged. Den continued his diatribe on Dennis, threatening to inform Sharon that he had killed Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), but it wasn't enough to scare Dennis off.\n\nDen continued to goad him, asking how long it would be before he turned his attentions to his biological sister Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson) and Dennis was sickened by the remark. Den argued that Dennis couldn't tell the difference between female relatives and lovers. He taunted Dennis about his background, telling him that years of misery and abuse had turned him into the man that he was. Dennis managed to remain calm and was sure that Den was closer to losing his temper than he was. Dennis said he realised that they would always be at loggerheads with each other. He had let Den triumph before, because he thought he wanted a dad, but even though Den had put up a good fight, he wasn't going to let him win this time. Den became enraged and asserted that his and Sharon's affair was over. He ordered Dennis to leave, but Dennis replied repeatedly that he loved Sharon. Calmly, he prepared to head home to her. Seeing that he was losing the fight Den turned angry and hurled Dennis through the doors of The Vic. Father and son stood head to head, while Dennis bragged about Sharon leaving with him. Cockily, he shoved his father aside. Furious, Den spat out that some twisted pervert must have got to Dennis in the past, and caused him to think that a relationship with his own sister was acceptable. He described the abuse Dennis must have suffered in care and waved goodbye to the son he never wanted. Dennis finally snapped and lunged at him out of control, but was restrained. Eventually he broke free and lashed out, accidentally punching Sharon, who had just arrived, in the process. A victorious Den then took Sharon home.\n\nThis episode featured Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). Alfie had been given a video of Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) sleeping with his wife. Alfie owed Andy money and when he couldn't pay he Andy threatened his safety. Kat slept with Andy as a trade for her husband's life, but Alfie could not accept her excuses.\n\nThe episode began with a jovial Kat returning home, but her mood soon changed after she saw that Andy had filmed their sordid liaison and maliciously given it to Alfie to watch. Alfie was in pieces and couldn't bear to look at his wife. As Kat pleaded with Alfie to listen to her explanation, he refused, so Kat screamed that she did it all for him. Alfie was disgusted and called her a cheap little slapper. Hurt, Kat slapped Alfie and he slapped her right back, leaving Kat stunned that he could do such a thing.\n\nAs it all sunk in Alfie broke down in tears, whilst Kat desperately tried to protest that Andy tricked her. Alfie could only laugh at her feeble excuse. She told him that she did it to protect him and because she loved him, but Alfie felt hurt and betrayed. He suggested that she go back to Andy, as he didn't want her anywhere near him. Through his tears and anguish Alfie revealed the guilt he'd always carried about his parents' death in a car crash and how he blamed himself for not fixing something his dad asked him to. Now he can't live with the thought that his negligence ruined things again. He told Kat that their marriage was over and Kat had no choice but to pack her bags. As she was about to go Alfie questioned her more about her motives and Kat tried to make him realise that Andy's behaviour was all about revenge and that they can get past this and stay together. As Alfie continued to reject her, Kat turned on him and brought up her past sexual abuse at the hands of her uncle Harry Slater (Michael Elphick) and likened it to her affair with Andy. Sobbing, she made one last attempt to change his mind and asked him to give her a cuddle. However, Alfie's pride wouldn't let him take her back and he showed her the door.\n\nAs Kat left The Vic in tears she heard the door open and saw Alfie there. She held out her hand and he took it. They agreed that it would be tough, but decided to try to find a way to work things out.\n\nThis episode featured long-time neighbours, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Dot Branning (June Brown). Den's wife had left him following his affair, and his relationship with his son was in tatters after he propositioned his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Dot was arguing with her husband, Jim Branning (John Bardon) and was very reluctant to tell him about her secret cancer illness. Den and Dot forced each other to examine their relationships with others.\n\nLate one evening Den spotted some youths vandalising the launderette. After seeing off the thugs, Dot emerged from the back room and Den could see that she had been crying.\n\nDot began to engage Den in conversation about his wife Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) and how he felt now that she had left him. Den's response was blasé, which angered Dot and she accused him of putting up a front. Dot chastised Den for his demeanour and pointed out that he couldn't face up to his own guilt. She told him that he treated his friends and family appallingly and when he had heard enough and turned to leave, he found that Dot had locked him in and refused to give him the keys. As Den was forced to continue the conversation Dot pestered him more about Chrissie and threatened to haunt him if he didn't plead Chrissie for forgiveness.\n\nEventually, Dot informed Den that she was dying and he was shocked to hear that she had kidney cancer. However Dot became cagey when Den quizzed her about her illness. He wanted her to have the best care possible and even offered to pay for it, but Dot rejected his help - she had chosen not to have her cancer treated. She wanted to face death with dignity and begged Den to keep her secret quiet as even her husband, Jim, didn't know she was suffering.\nDen wasn't convinced by Dot's motives for keeping her illness from Jim, but she believed that she was acting in his best interests. Den insisted that Dot's deceit would destroy her marriage and told her to open up to Jim. Den then slyly told her that if she didn't come clean with Jim, she couldn't take the moral high ground next time he messed up. They both decided that they needed to sort their marriages out.\n\nWhen Jim arrived to collect Dot, Den explained that she was sorting him out and squeezed Dot's hand tenderly before leaving. At home Den apologised to his son and heeding Dot's advice, he bit the bullet and called Chrissie. Meanwhile, Dot took Den's advice and decided that it was time to come clean to Jim.\n\nFollowing Stacey Branning's (Lacey Turner) confession to her father-in-law Max Branning (Jake Wood) that she murdered Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) (see Who Killed Archie?, the two characters featured in a two-hander episode on 26 March 2010. The killer was kept a secret from all the cast until 30 minutes before a live episode was broadcast on 19 February 2010, meaning that the script for the two-hander episode, written by Simon Ashdown, could not be released until after the broadcast, though later episodes had already been completed. The cast had been told there was a special episode coming up, but that it would actually feature three characters, one being Archie's murderer. Wood described Ashdown's script as \"amazing\", saying that Ashdown knows the characters inside out, and hoped he could do the script justice. Wood and Turner were given three days to rehearse. One 19-minute scene took up 26 pages in the script, and was filmed in two takes. The entire episode was filmed in three night shoots and one studio shoot. It was originally scheduled to be filmed over three days, but a fourth day was added for on-location filming. Some night-time location filming was done on 9 March 2010.\n\nThe episode follows on from the previous episode where Max discovers where his daughter-in-law Stacey is staying after the death of her husband, Bradley (Charlie Clements), and her confession to the murder of Archie. Max goes up to her flat and enters, pressing her for details of Archie's murder, the night of Bradley's death and what she had done in her absence. Stacey reveals that after she fled the morgue, she contemplated suicide but could not bring herself to do it for the sake of her unborn child; she then went to her mother's old flat which was deserted and did not move for three days; eventually leaving to buy food and drink. Max tells her that he wants to hand her in to the police. Max then chases Stacey outside, where she trips and he catches her. He then drags Stacey to a car, which he breaks into and bundles her into. He then hot-wires the car and drives to a police station. After telling Stacey that she must confess to her mother and the Mitchells first, he drives her back to Walford where he eventually changes his mind after expressing that Bradley would want her to be happy. The episode ends with them both entering their respective houses and the camera panning up over Walford, rising so high that it morphs into the \"EastEnders\" credits.\n\nThis episode features Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) revealing to her best friend Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) her reasons for returning to the United Kingdom after 20 years. Although their scenes are interspersed with scenes of Dot Branning (June Brown) at home waiting for her cat, and the episode credits 20 characters, it was officially considered a two-hander by BBC Store and was included in their \"\"EastEnders\": Two's Company\" collection of two-hander episodes.\n\nDuring this episode, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) explains to Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) why he has given him the car lot, which is worth £300,000 rather than giving it to his son Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), who received the lesser valued Arches. Phil tells Jay that Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord) was not his biological father as he didn't know Jay's mother until two months after his birth. Phil tells Jay that a tramp living rough around Albert Square, named Alan Hall, was his birth father and that in an insurance scam back in 1994 he and Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) committed arson to the car lot and that they weren't aware Alan was sleeping in one of the cars within. Phil attempts to persuade Jay that there would be no point in going to prison because he is still paying for the crime in the form of guilt. At the end of the episode Jay is seen sat at \"Jase's bench\" while Phil is seen making a phone call to an unknown person, he tells them that he's \"done it\" and \"fed him [Jay] a pack of lies and that it's now their turn to keep to the deal\".\n\nA two-hander between Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) and Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ). Linda's husband, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) is in prison because Stuart claims Mick shot him but Linda believes that Stuart is lying. In this episode, Linda seduces Stuart and during their passion, she says Mick used to have an unpredictable energy like Stuart does now, and would have believed he shot someone back then but not now in an attempt to gain a confession. Stuart becomes suspicious and while Linda is out of the room, he finds a recording device hidden behind the bed, which he reveals to Linda. She calls him stupid, saying he thought she liked him but she was repulsed. In the bar, he rants about how Mick has everything and he never cared when Stuart went to prison for something Mick did when they were teenagers. Linda says Stuart made his own decisions and now wants someone to blame because he has nobody in his life. He attempts to rape her but she smashes a bottle on his head, saying he would never have the nerve to pull the trigger but Mick would, to which Stuart says Mick did not shoot him and he leaves. Linda then takes a second recording device she had hidden in her hair and transfers Stuart's confession to her laptop.\n\n\"EastEnders\" is also notable for featuring three and four-hander episodes. Within three-hander episodes three characters usually interact separately with each other in differing scenes, whilst four-handers often include two sets of characters stories which occur simultaneously, although they are not directly connected to each other there is usually a linking theme.\n\n\n\n\n\"EastEnders\" had its first (and only to date) single-hander episode which featured only one character; Dot Cotton in the entire episode. The episode saw Dot recording a cassette tape of memories for her husband Jim and was written by Tony Jordan. The episode was shown on 31 January 2008, and was watched by 8.7 million viewers. Instead of the usual theme music, the credits had the song \"Pretty Baby\" playing over them, as it was referenced in the episode. The episode was also titled \"Pretty Baby...\"\n\nIn March 2009, actress June Brown was nominated for the Best TV Actress award at the British Academy Television Awards for her portrayal of Dot in this episode.\n\n\"EastEnders\" two-handers have since been emulated in other British soap operas, notably \"Coronation Street\" and \"Brookside\"\n\n", "id": "7711850", "categories": ["EastEnders episodes"], "title": "List of EastEnders two-hander episodes"}

Mackie\n\nJohn Freeman Mackie (October 1, 1835–June 18, 1910) was a United States Marine Corps sergeant during the American Civil War. He was awarded the nation's highest military decoration for valor—the Medal of Honor, for his actions aboard the USS during the battle with Confederate Marines and artillery batteries at Fort Darling near Richmond, Virginia, on May 15, 1862. He is one of the first two Marines to be awarded the Medal of Honor, and is considered to be the first Marine to receive the Medal of Honor in the history of the Marine Corps.\n\nMackie enlisted in the Marine Corps from New York on April 24, 1861. His first assignment was with the Marine Detachment on board the USS \"Savannah\". He was promoted to corporal on March 1, 1862. On April 1, he began serving on the ironclad warship USS \"Galena\". On May 15, a five-ship Union Navy squadron, including the \"Galena\", steamed up the James River to test the defenses of the Confederate capital, Richmond, Virginia. After reaching a bend in the river upstream of Dutch Gap, the squadron encountered submerged obstacles and heavy fire from two battalions of Confederate Marines positioned on the banks of the river and artillery fire from Fort Darling atop Drewry's Bluff about eight miles below Richmond. Mackie commanded 12 Marines on the gun deck. The fort's artillery batteries inflicted severe damage on the \"Galena\" and forced the Union squadron to turn back. During the battle (which would come to be known as the Battle of Drewry's Bluff), most of \"Galena\"'s naval gun crew was killed or wounded. Mackie led a group of Marines who took over operation of the guns for the remainder of the battle. On November 1, he was promoted to orderly sergeant. In June 1863, he was assigned to the USS Seminole. \n\nOn July 10, 1863, Mackie was awarded the Medal of Honor (Navy version) for his actions aboard the \"Galena\" on May 15, 1862. Mackie was particularly mentioned for his \"gallant conduct and services and signal acts of devotion to duty\".On October 11, 1863, he received the medal by U.S. Postal Service mail while aboard the \"Seminole\" which was anchored off Sabine Pass, Texas. Mackie was presented the Medal of Honor during a ceremony on the quarterdeck of the ship. He was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps on August 23, 1865 in Boston. Mackie and Sergeant Pinkerton Vaughn (, 1863) were the first Marines to be awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nMackie eventually married and settled near Philadelphia. He died at the age of 74 and is buried in Arlington Cemetery, Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. His grave can be found in the Melrose section, lot 606, grave 2. At Drewry's Bluff, now within Richmond National Battlefield Park, a marker is posted which features Mackie's Medal of Honor action.\n\nMackie's Medal of Honor Citation reads:\n\nRank and Organization: Corporal, U.S. Marine Corps<br>\nBorn: 1836, New York, N.Y.<br> \nAccredited to: New York<br> \nG.O. No.: 17, 10 July 1863\n\nCitation:\n\nOn board the U.S.S. \"Galena\", in the attack on Fort Darling, at Drewry's Bluff, James River, on May 15, 1862. As enemy shellfire raked the deck of his ship, Corporal Mackie fearlessly maintained his musket fire against the rifle pits along the shore and, when ordered to fill vacancies at guns caused by men wounded and killed in action, manned the weapon with skill and courage.\n\n", "id": "7711907", "categories": ["1835 births", "Burials at Arlington Cemetery (Pennsylvania)", "1910 deaths", "Union Marines", "United States Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients", "American Civil War recipients of the Medal of Honor"], "title": "John F.

It was built in 1804 by James Plumb, and is exceptionally well preserved. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\nThe house is built with clapboard sidings, a brownstone foundation and an asphalt shingle roof. It has a wood frame, with post and beam construction and a hip roof. The architect and builder are unknown. Historically and currently it has been a private residence.\n\nJames Plumb, a well-to-do farmer in Westfield, built this house in 1804 on land inherited from his father, Samuel Plumb. The house remained in the Plumb-Barry family until 1888; since then it has passed through a succession of owners while retaining its traditional residential usage.\n\nThis finely-scaled Federal style frame house is of a central hall plan; its exterior displays a symmetrical five-bay facade with hip roof and twin chimneys. A denticulated main cornice and delicate window caps add decorative interest to the facade, while attention is drawn to the entrance by a columned porch with cove ceiling. The possibility exists that the northeast kitchen wing is Samuel Plumb's own dwelling house, built around 1740, and relegated to a minor role as an attached dependency by the subsequent construction of James Plumb's \"Mansion House\".\n\nThe large original condition of this house, together with its distinctive appearance and compatible site, makes it a rare and pleasing example of early Federal style architecture in Middletown.\n\nThis house faces south from the northeast corner of Westfield and East Streets. Tall shade trees shield the house from the nearby roads. Neighboring structures date from post-World War II development of this formerly rural area.\n", "id": "7711923", "categories": ["Houses completed in 1804", "Houses in Middletown, Connecticut", "Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut", "Federal architecture in Connecticut"], "title": "Plumb House (Middletown, Connecticut)"}

In his senior year in 1999, he was named USA Today's Defensive Player of the Year and was a consensus All-American choice. He also excelled in track and field, winning the state Class 5A title in the discus as a junior and senior (career best toss of 193'9\").\n\nRedding played college football for the Texas Longhorns at the University of Texas. During his four years there, he was a two-time All-Big 12 Conference selection and played in every game, including a string of 35 consecutive starts on the defensive line.\n\nHe finished his collegiate career with 201 tackles (123 solos), 21 sacks (174 yards), and 53 tackles for a loss totaling 249 yards (third on the school's career-record list).\n\nIn the 2003 NFL Draft Redding was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the 3rd round (66th overall).\n\nHe became the starter at left defensive end prior to the 2004 season.

On July 16, the Lions and Redding agreed to a seven-year, $49 million contract. The deal included over $16 million in guaranteed money. The move came amid a bit of controversy, as it made Redding the highest paid defensive tackle in the league.\n\nRedding was placed on season-ending injured reserve with injuries to his knee and groin on December 12, 2008.\n\nOn March 14, 2009, Detroit traded him and a 2009 fifth-round draft pick to the Seattle Seahawks for linebacker Julian Peterson.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712057", "text": "Christianity in Mongolia\n\nChristianity in Mongolia is a minority religion. As of 2005, the United States Department of State reports that approximately 24,000 Christians live in Mongolia's capital, Ulaanbaatar, which is around 2.5 percent of the entire registered population of the city.\n\nMost Christians in Mongolia became Christian after the end of Mongolia's communist regime in 1990. According to the Christian missionary group Barnabas Fund, the number of Christians grew from just four in 1989 to around 40,000 as of 2008.\n\nAccording to the 2010 National Census there were 41,117 Christians (age of 15 and older) or 2.1% of total population.\n\nNestorianism was the first form of Christianity to be proselytized among the Mongols, in the 7th century, and several Mongols, at least a dozen, became primarily Christian. During the rise of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, the Great Khans, though mostly Shamanists and Buddhist, were religiously tolerant towards the Nestorian Christians, Muslims, and Manichaeans. Many of the khans had Nestorian Christian wives from the Kerait clan, who were extremely influential in the Mongol court. During the rule of Möngke Khan, Christianity was the primary religious influence. After the breakup of the Mongol Empire in the 14th century, Nestorian Christianity nearly disappeared from the region.\n\nThere are only very few archeological traces of the prospering of Nestorianism among the Mongols. In Inner Mongolia, several Nestorian gravestones have been recorded in the past, but none now remain \"in situ\".\n\nThe Orthodox Churches and its monks became victims to the Mongol invasion of Eastern Europe in the early 13th century. However, Jarlig or charter of immunity, also contributed to the strengthening of the Church. With the reign of Möngke-Temür, a jarlig was issued to Metropolitan Kirill for the Orthodox Church in 1267. While the church had been under the de facto protection of the Mongols ten years earlier (from the 1257 census conducted under Khan Berke), this jarlig formally decreed protection for the Orthodox Church. More importantly, it officially exempted the church from any form of taxation by Mongol or Russian authorities and permitted clergymen to remain unregistered during censuses and clergy were furthermore not liable for forced labor or military service. For the first time, the Orthodox church would become less dependent on princely powers than in any other period of Russian history.\n\nFrom 1771 to 1845 at least eight missions of the Russian Orthodox Church visited Mongolia. The first Orthodox church on Mongolian territory, Holy Trinity Church (), was established in Khalkha's capital city Urga in 1872, and newly rebuilt there in 2007.\n\nHistorically, much of Europe had been ruled by Turkish and Mongolian tribes both of which originated in Mongolia. The Holy Roman Empire was officially supplanted by the Ottoman Turks in the Middle Ages.\nWestern Catholicism was first introduced in medieval times, primarily through Franciscan and Dominican missionaries, sent to the Mongol court in Karakorum and also via medieval Roman Catholic missions in China. Missionaries to China were successful during the Mongol-created Yuan Dynasty in China in the late 13th/early 14th centuries. However, after the native Chinese Ming Dynasty overthrew the Yuan Dynasty in 1368, Christians were expelled from China. Many Mongols in the western part of the Empire converted to Islam, and with the collapse of the entire Mongol Empire in the 14th century, Christianity nearly disappeared from Central Asia, only reappearing after the Second Opium War in the mid-19th century. In time, a mission was founded for Outer Mongolia, giving Mongolia its first Roman Catholic jurisdiction, but all work ceased within a year when a communist regime came to power and freedom of thought and religion were no longer permitted.\n\nWith the introduction of democracy in 1990, Roman Catholic missionaries returned and rebuilt the church from scratch. As of 2006, there is an Apostolic Prefecture, a bishop, three churches, and diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Mongolia since 1992. Pope John Paul II originally planned to visit Mongolia along with Kazan, but he eventually cancelled the trip, supposedly explaining to a Russian newspaper that \"Our Lord does not want it\". By 2014, there were 919 Catholics in the Prefecture Apostolic of Ulaanbaatar, headed by Wenceslao Selga Padilla, C.I.C.M. as Prefect and organized into 6 parishes.\n\nMost Christians in Mongolia today are Protestant, and most have become Christians since Mongolia's transition to democracy in the early 1990s. Mongolia has a local Christian TV station, Eagle Television, and a pro-Christian radio station, Family Radio.\n\nIn 1992, 6 LDS couples arrived in Mongolia as English teachers. In 1995, the Mongolia Ulaanbaatar Mission was established with Richard Cook as the first mission president. The Ulaanbaatar Mongolia West Stake with 6 congregations was formed in 2009 growing to 9 congregations by May 2016. The Ulaanbaatar Mongolia East Stake was created in May 2016 with 6 congregations. About 2010 new visa laws went into effect limiting foreigners causing many of the foreign LDS missionaries to be reassigned to other countries. There were, however, about 110 Mongolian missionaries serving full time missions inside Mongolia. By the end of 2015, the LDS Church had 11,250 members in 23 congregations.\n\n", "id": "7712057", "categories": [], "title": "Christianity in Mongolia"}

Graduated from the department of philosophy in the University of Tartu in 1840. In 1849 he became a professor of Persian and Arab literature in Moscow in the Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages. He published a number of scholarly works and earned his doctoral dissertation on a work analyzing Ferdowsi's Shahnameh.\n\nUnder the influence of the European enlightenment movement and the Russian social movement of the 40's, Nazarian increasingly began writing against the feudal system and its ideology. In the 50's he became the leader of the Armenian enlightenment movement. Between 1858 and 1864 he published in Moscow the influential magazine \"Hyusisapayl\" (Aurora Borealis), that had a great effect on the development of progressive public thought in Armenia. He criticized serfdom and clerical power for the spiritual revival of the Armenian people; however, he refused to classify his actions as part of a broader class struggle. Nazarian advanced the idea of public education in the new enlightenment era as well as the replacement of Classical Armenian (grabar) with the new literary Ashkarhabar. He was a supporter of deism and promoted Russian and foreign literature. Translated many of Friedrich Schiller's dramas.\n\n", "id": "7712086", "categories": ["Armenian orientalists", "Imperial Russian historians", "1812 births", "Armenian historians", "Imperial Russian Armenians", "19th-century translators", "19th-century historians", "Imperial Russian male writers", "People from Tbilisi", "Ethnic Armenian translators", "1879 deaths"], "title": "Stepanos Nazarian"}

Its towers are the tallest electricity pylons in the UK.\n\nThe present crossing was built in 1965, and comprises two 190-metre (623 feet) tall lattice towers each side of the Thames. Some suggest that the choice of this height was deliberate, being just taller than the BT Tower in London. The span is 1372 metres (4501 feet), the minimum height of the conductors over the river is 76 metres (249 feet). Each tower has three crossarms and carries two circuits of 400 kV three-phase AC.\n\nThere was at one time an earlier 132 kV crossing nearby, with towers 148.4 metres tall. Linking Dagenham and Crossness, it was built between 1927 and 1932 and was part of the Belvedere-Crowlands 132/33/25 kV double circuit. With the cessation of generation at Belvedere Power Station, this line was dismantled in 1987.\n\nIn March 2006, Paul Smith-Crallan attempted to BASE jump from a platform on the Swanscombe Tower. The parachute he was using is believed to have failed to open, causing him to plunge to his death. This tower is a popular base jumping location because of two platforms that provide good launch points.\n\n\n", "id": "7712087", "categories": ["Towers in Kent", "Powerline river crossings", "1965 establishments in England", "Electric power infrastructure in England"], "title": "400 kV Thames Crossing"}

It is the primary law in India dealing with cybercrime and electronic commerce. It is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration recommended by the General Assembly of United Nations by a resolution dated 30 January 1997.\n\nThe bill was passed in the budget session of 2000 and signed by President K. R. Narayanan on 9 May 2000. The bill was finalised by group of officials headed by then Minister of Information Technology Pramod Mahajan.\n\nThe original Act contained 94 sections, divided into 13 chapters and 4 schedules. The laws apply to the whole of India. Persons of other nationalities can also be indicted under the law, if the crime involves a computer or network located in India.\n\nThe Act provides a legal framework for electronic governance by giving recognition to electronic records and digital signatures. It also defines cyber crimes and prescribes penalties for them. The Act directed the formation of a Controller of Certifying Authorities to regulate the issuance of digital signatures. It also established a Cyber Appellate Tribunal to resolve disputes rising from this new law. The Act also amended various sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Indian, 1872, the Banker's Book Evidence Act, 1891, and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 to make them compliant with new technologies.\n\nA major amendment was made in 2008. It introduced Section 66A which penalized sending of \"offensive messages\". It also introduced Section 69, which gave authorities the power of \"interception or monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource\". It also introduced provisions addressing child porn, cyber terrorism and voyeurism. The amendment was passed on 22 December 2008 without any debate in Lok Sabha. The next day it was passed by the Rajya Sabha. It was signed into law by President Pratibha Patil, on 5 February 2009.\n\nList of offences and the corresponding penalties:\n\n\n\nFrom its establishment as an amendment to the original act in 2008, Section 66A attracted controversy over its unconstitutional nature:\n\nIn December 2012, P Rajeev, a Rajya Sabha member from Kerala, tried to pass a resolution seeking to amend the Section 66A. He was supported by D. Bandyopadhyay, Gyan Prakash Pilania, Basavaraj Patil Sedam, Narendra Kumar Kashyap, Rama Chandra Khuntia and Baishnab Charan Parida. P Rajeev pointed that cartoons and editorials allowed in traditional media, were being censored in the new media. He also said that law was barely debated before being passed in December 2008.\n\nRajeev Chandrasekhar suggested the 66A should only apply to person to person communication pointing to a similar section under the Indian Post Office Act, 1898. Shantaram Naik opposed any changes, saying that the misuse of law was sufficient to warrant changes. Then Minister for Communications and Information Technology Kapil Sibal defended the existing law, saying that similar laws existed in US and UK. He also said that a similar provision existed under Indian Post Office Act, 1898. However, P Rajeev said that the UK dealt only with communication from person to person.\n\nIn November 2012, IPS officer Amitabh Thakur and his wife social activist Nutan Thakur, filed a petition in the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court claiming that the Section 66A violated the freedom of speech guaranteed in the Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. They said that the section was vague and frequently misused.\n\nAlso in November 2012, a Delhi-based law student, Shreya Singhal, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court of India. She argued that the Section 66A was vaguely phrased, as result it violated Article 14, 19 (1)(a) and Article 21 of the Constitution. The PIL was accepted on 29 November 2012. A similar petition was also filed by the founder of MouthShut.com, Faisal Farooqui, and NGO Common Cause represented by Prashant Bhushan\nIn August 2014, the Supreme Court asked the central government to respond to petitions filed by Mouthshut.com and later petition filed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) which claimed that the IT Act gave the government power to arbitrarily remove user-generated content.\n\nOn 24 March 2015, the Supreme Court of India, gave the verdict that Section 66A is unconstitutional in entirety. The court said that Section 66A of IT Act 2000 is \"arbitrarily, excessively and disproportionately invades the right of free speech\" provided under Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India. But the Court turned down a plea to strike down sections 69A and 79 of the Act, which deal with the procedure and safeguards for blocking certain websites. \n\nThe data privacy rules introduced in the Act in 2011 have been described as too strict by some Indian and US firms. The rules require firms to obtain written permission from customers before collecting and using their personal data. This has affected US firms which outsource to Indian companies. However, some companies have welcomed the strict rules, saying it will remove fears of outsourcing to Indian companies.\n\nThe Section 69 allows intercepting any information and ask for information decryption. To refuse decryption is an offence. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 allows the government to tap phones. But, according to a 1996 Supreme Court verdict the government can tap phones only in case of a \"public emergency\". But, there is no such restriction on Section 69. On 20 December 2018, the Ministry of Home Affairs cited Section 69 in the issue of an order authorising ten central agencies to intercept, monitor, and decrypt “any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer.” While some claim this to be a violation of the fundamental right to privacy, the Ministry of Home Affairs has claimed its validity on the grounds of national security. \n\nOn 2 April 2015, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis revealed to the state assembly that a new law was being framed to replace the repealed Section 66A. Fadnavis was replying to a query Shiv Sena leader Neelam Gorhe. Gorhe had said that repeal of the law would encourage online miscreants and asked whether the state government would frame a law to this regard. Fadnavis said that the previous law had resulted in no convictions, so the law would be framed such that it would be strong and result in convictions.\n\nOn 13 April 2015, it announced that the Ministry of Home Affairs would form a committee of officials from the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency, Delhi Police and ministry itself to produce a new legal framework. This step was reportedly taken after complaints from intelligence agencies that, they were no longer able to counter online posts that involved national security matter or incite people to commit an offence, such as online recruitment for ISIS. Former Minister of State with the Ministry of Information Technology, Milind Deora has supported a new \"unambiguous section to replace 66A\".\n\n\n\n", "id": "7712095", "categories": ["Censorship in India", "2008 in law", "Acts of the Parliament of India 2000", "Vajpayee administration", "2000 in India", "2000 in law", "2008 in India", "Computing legislation", "Manmohan Singh administration", "Information technology in India", "Internet in India"], "title": "Information Technology Act, 2000"}

In 2007, the college had 867 pupils aged 11 – 18 and a Preparatory Department with 175 girls, aged 3 – 11.\n\nVictoria College has been awarded specialist school status beginning from September 2009. The college will specialise in STEM-related areas (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths).\n\nFounded by Mrs Margaret Byers (1832–1912) in 1859, it is one of the longest established girls' schools in the British Isles. The college was established in Wellington Place and was first known as The Ladies' Collegiate School Belfast. \n\nIn 1887, Queen Victoria's Jubilee Year, the name of the school was changed by Royal Command to Victoria College and School. A century later, Victoria College amalgamated with Richmond Lodge School, a neighbouring girls' school of similar status.\n\nThe origins of Richmond Lodge lie in a school opened in 1879 by the Misses Hardy on the Stranmillis Road. It moved to the Malone Road in 1913 and soon acquired full academic recognition. Richmond Lodge past pupils continue their association with the school through the Arellian Association.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1970, the art department at Victoria College was headed by Mercy Hunter, a notable calligrapher and influential teacher.\n\nOver the past 150 years, Victoria College (as it is now called) has relocated several times. Former Belfast locations include Howard Street, Pakenham Place and Lower Crescent before the current school was established at Cranmore in the 1970s. School house names reflect the past locations.\n\nThe school has two campuses the Richmond Campus (for Forms 1 & 2) and the Cranmore Campus (for Forms 3-U6). In addition, a kindergarten for boys and girls is located within the Richmond Campus and the girls only Preparatory Department is located on the Cranmore Campus. \n\nThe whole school is situated within extensive mature grounds in South Belfast. This location between two of the main arterial routes into the City is convenient to city, town and country bus routes and the local railway network. It is also within walking distance of the Queen's University Belfast and the Ulster Museum and many local art galleries and theatres.\n\nThe school is staffed by 82 full- and part-time teachers and 30 support staff.\n\nDrumglass House was built in 1820 and serves as the Boarding Department for girls of all ages and all backgrounds. It is located within the grounds of the Cranmore Campus. The Boarding Department caters for up to 60 boarders, many from Europe or East Asia.\n\n2009 saw the 150th anniversary of the founding of the college. Throughout 2009, events celebrating the history of the school took place. An exhibition opened in May 2009 at the college.\n\nIn addition, the college has been successful in several competitions. These include\n\nF1 in Schools 2009 - National champions, GT class.\n\nUKAYRoC 2009 - Only all-girls team to finish in the top three.\n\nIn 2010, a team of pupils from the College won their regional heat of the Faraday Challenge and subsequently took first prize at the National Finals held in Manchester.\n\nGCSE and A-level results in the college are consistently high every year. The exam boards offered to students are Edexcel, AQA, OCR, CCEA, WJEC. The % pass rate at grades A* to C (exams at age 16 - GCSE or equivalent)is 97%; the % pass rate (exams at age 18 - 'A' Level or equivalent) is 100%. Several pupils of the school are usually admitted to Oxbridge every year.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7712110", "categories": ["Grammar schools in Belfast", "Boarding schools in Ireland", "Girls' schools in Northern Ireland", "Educational institutions established in 1859", "Boarding schools in Northern Ireland"], "title": "Victoria College, Belfast"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712111", "text": "He's So Fine\n\n\"He's So Fine\" is a song written by Ronald Mack. It was recorded by The Chiffons who topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for four weeks in the spring of 1963. One of the most instantly recognizable Golden Oldies with its \"doo-lang doo-lang doo-lang\" background vocal, \"He's So Fine\" is also renowned as the plaintiff song in the now-infamous plagiarism case against George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord\".\n\nCountry music singer Jody Miller scored a top-ten hit of her own in 1971 with her cover of \"He's So Fine\".\n\n\"He's So Fine\" was written by Ronald Mack, an acquaintance of the Chiffons' members who set himself up as their manager after overhearing them harmonise in their high school's lunch room. Mack elicited the interest of Bright Tunes Corporation, a production company run by the Tokens, who produced the Chiffons singing \"He's So Fine\", and two other Mack compositions at Capitol Recording Studios.\n\nThe Tokens themselves – who had never previously played on a recording session – provided the instrumentation, with the services of drummer Gary Chester.\n\nOriginally one of the two other songs: \"Oh, My Lover\", was considered the potential hit. But the completed track for \"He's So Fine\" with its now-classic 'Doo-lang doo-lang doo-lang' background vocal – the suggestion of the session's sound engineer Johnny Cue – seemed an obvious smash. However Capitol Records (for whom the Tokens were house producers) rejected the track: Jay Siegal of the Tokens recalled Capitol's president Voyle Gilmore dismissing the track as \"too trite...too simple\". The Tokens shopped \"He's So Fine\" to ten labels before placing it with Laurie Records. According to Siegal, \"We played it, and they locked the doors and said 'You're not getting out of here. We want that record.'...Of course we'd already been turned down by ten companies. Give us eighty cents and we'd have given you the record.\"\n\nThe Chiffons' two later Top 10 hits both contain echoes of \"He's So Fine\", although neither song was written by Ronald Mack, who died soon after the Chiffons had recorded his song. \"One Fine Day\" was written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin, and \"Sweet Talking Guy\" – in which the background vocalists sing \"he's so fine\" – was co-written by the co-founder of Laurie Records, Eliot Greenberg. \n\n\"He's So Fine\" by The Chiffons is also featured on the soundtrack album to the 1979 film \"Quadrophenia\" by the English band The Who.\n\nReleased in early 1963, \"He's So Fine\" entered the national charts in February 1963 attaining the #1 position on March 30 and remaining #1 for a four-week period and also made it to number one on the soul singles chart. \"Billboard\" ranked the record as the No. 5 song of 1963. \"He's So Fine\" was also a #16 hit in the UK. \"Billboard\" named the song #73 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.\n\nOn February 10, 1971, Bright Tunes Music Corporation filed suit alleging the then current George Harrison hit, \"My Sweet Lord\", was a plagiarism of \"He's So Fine\". The case did not go to trial until February 1976 when the judge ruled on the liability portion of the suit in favor of Bright Tunes, determining that Harrison had committed \"subconscious\" plagiarism.\nThe suit to determine damages was scheduled for November 1976 but delayed until February 1981, by which time Allen Klein, Harrison's onetime manager who had been his legal adviser in the first phase of the suit, had become the plaintiff by virtue of purchasing Bright Tunes. The final decision was that Harrison himself would purchase Bright Tunes from Klein for $587,000—the amount Klein had paid for the corporation—and although litigation continued for at least ten more years that decision was upheld. In 1975 the Chiffons would record a version of \"My Sweet Lord\", attempting to capitalize on the publicity generated by the lawsuit. Harrison's \"This Song\" was written in reaction to the plagiarism suit.\n\nJody Miller had a Top Ten C&W hit with her remake of \"He's So Fine\" recorded in a February 17, 1971 session at the Columbia studio in Nashville and issued May 12, 1971 as the advance single from Miller's \"He's So Fine\" album, that album — released August 1971 — being Miller's second full-length collaboration with producer Billy Sherrill. Miller's remake omits the original's 'doo lang' background vocal. Besides the title cut, the \"He's So Fine\" album featured Miller's remake of the 1965 Barbara Lewis hit \"Baby I'm Yours\": Miller's third Sherrill-produced album \"There's a Party Going On\" afforded Miller C&W hit remakes of the Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\" and the Teddy Bears' \"To Know Him is to Love Him\".\n\nImpressed by the 1968 Tammy Wynette hit \"Stand By Your Man\", Miller had contacted that track's producer Billy Sherrill in the hopes of reviving her own flagging recording career and after \"Look at Mine\", Miller's first album in Sherrill's charge, generated two Top Twenty C&W hits in 1970, Sherrill opted for a new musical direction for Miller who recalls: \"He said I didn't phrase my words like a country singer, so we took some old, sexy pop songs and put in a little boppy steel guitar\".\n\nMiller's cover version of \"He's So Fine\" peaked at #5 C&W in July 1971, and crossed over to the Pop charts and also Easy Listening charts with July 1971 peaks of #53 Pop and #2 Easy Listening, the latter stat representing Miller's alltime best chart showing. \"He's So Fine\" also afforded Miller a Top Ten C&W hit in Canada with a #3 peak, with the track reaching #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart for Canada and crossing over to #46 on the Canadian Pop chart. In Australia Miller's \"He's So Fine\" charted with a #28 peak.\n\nIn the spring of 1978 two disparate remakes of \"He's So Fine\" were released as singles with both singles eventually ranking on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Jane Olivor recorded the song as a ballad for her album \"Stay the Night\", producer Jason Darrow having wanted a \"lighter song\" for the album: Olivor had been initially unmoved by Darrow's endorsement of a slow version of \"He's So Fine\" – whose lyrics Olivor found vapid – but the singer saw the validity of her producer's suggestion after Darrow played Olivor the Chiffons' 45 rpm single at 331⁄3 rpm. Released as a single in April 1978, \"He's So Fine\" debuted on the Hot 100 dated 20 May 1978 becoming the second of Olivor's two Hot 100 entries and with its eventual peak of #77 becoming the more successful as Olivor's precedent Hot 100 single \"Some Enchanted Evening\" had peaked at #91 in 1976. (Olivor would \"bubble under the Hot 100\" chart in 1980 when her single \"Don't Let Go of Me\" peaked at #108.) \"He's So Fine\" would also afford Olivor her sole ranking on the \"Billboard\" Easy Listening chart where its peak would be #21, also ranking in the Canadian singles chart with a #71 peak and rising as high as #3 on the Canadian Easy Listening chart.\n\nMay 1978 saw the release of an attempted replication of the original \"He's So Fine\" credited to Kristy and Jimmy McNichol although the track only featured the former, being credited to the duo to reflect its parent \"Kristy and Jimmy McNichol\" album which was produced by Philip Margo and Mitch Margo who – as members of the Tokens – had produced the Chiffons' original: three members of the Chiffons: Patricia Bennett, Barbara Lee, and Sylvia Peterson, sang back-up on the McNichol remake of \"He's So Fine.\" Both the McNichol version of \"He's So Fine\" and that by Jane Olivor appeared in the \"Record World\" ranking of the singles at positions #101 to #150 as early as the chart dated 20 May 1978 although the McNichol take would not debut on the \"Record World\" ranking of the top 100 singles until that dated 5 August 1978 two weeks subsequent to the track's debut on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 dated 22 July 1978 (one week after the final Hot 100 appearance of the Jane Olivor take whose Hot 100 tenure ended as of the chart dated 15 July 1978): on the \"Cash Box\" Top 100 the McNichol \"He's So Fine\" made its debut on the chart dated 30 July 1978. The McNichol \"He's So Fine\" would peak at #70 on the Hot 100. (The chart fortunes of both the Olivor and McNichol takes on \"He's So Fine\" varies widely according to which of the three music trade periodicals is cited: \"Record World\" affords a peak of #87 to both the Oliver and McNichol versions while according to \"Cash Box\" the Olivor take peaked at #67, McNicol's at #83.)\n\n\n", "id": "7712111", "categories": ["Laurie Records singles", "1962 songs", "Jody Miller songs", "Songs written by Ronnie Mack", "1963 singles", "Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles"], "title": "He's So Fine"}

South of this southern segment, a gap without volcanic activity separates the Southern Volcanic Zone from the Austral Volcanic Zone.\n\nThe volcanic field extends from the western side of the channel north over the head of the channel towards Lake Risopatrón, with one isolated cone found on the eastern side of the channel. The town of Puyuhuapi is located approximately halfway through the field. The cones on the western side are a separate group from the ones towards the north and associated with two different eruption fissures, but both fissures are associated with the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone. The basement on which the field is built is formed by rocks of the Patagonian Batholith.\n\nThe field is formed by cinder cones, while the isolated centre is formed by a fissure fed lava flow. The southernmost cone is also the largest with a diametre of and features a high secondary cone nested within its wide summit crater. The eruption fissures also generated lava flows; the cones formed afterwards over the fissures. On the northern end of the Puyuhuapi channel, the eruptions filled part of the channel and separated Lake Risopatrón from it; this activity may have been phreatomagmatic in nature. Two edifices have a volume of and respectively.\n\nThe cones were constructed by basaltic andesite, which contains clinopyroxene, olivine and plagioclase. The petrologically primitive composition suggests that they were constructed from primitive asthenosphere derived magmas that reached the surface directly, through the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault system. \n\nThe cones may be extremely young, one eruption with a volume of about may have occurred about 9,000 years ago based on stratigraphy, although the date is fairly uncertain. The glacial isostasy phenomena at the end of the last ice age may have triggered the magma ascent and thus eruptions.\n\n\n", "id": "7712132", "categories": ["Mountains of Chile", "Cinder cones of Chile", "Volcanic groups"], "title": "Puyuhuapi (volcanic group)"}

The building stands at the junction of Russell Street and East Main Street in South Farms. There is a small pond to the south. East Main Street's commercial and industrial development ends there. To the north, small businesses border the street, followed by the buildings of Russell Manufacturing Company, the area's most dominant feature. Russell Street crosses Sumner Brook nearby and ascends to a large residential district to the west. The mill is currently a condo-apartment complex.\n\nThis factory was erected by the Russell Manufacturing Company in 1836, and is the oldest surviving textile mill building in the city. Incorporated in 1834 by Samuel Russell, Samuel Hubbard and others, in 1841, the company was the first to produce elastic webbing on power looms. By 1896, it manufactured a wide variety of woven products and was the nation's largest manufacturer of suspenders. Approximately 900 workers were employed in the company's seven mills.\n\nThe original brick structure, identified as the \"Webb Mill\" on the 1859 Walling map, runs parallel to Sumner Brook. A mill race once flowed through the building. The long main factory section has a gabled roof trimmed by a corbeled brick cornice moulding. The exterior of the structure has vertical, metal supports that reinforce the brick walls. The two mansard roofed ells, added prior to 1874, have a number of gabled dormers. A smokestack and decorative towers that crowned different parts of the roof were removed after 1896.\n\nThe building, together with dam and pond nearby, reflects South Farms' early industrial history. The success of the Russell Manufacturing Company transformed the area into a thriving city district. Three company factories bordered the brook here in 1850. Of these, this structure is the last remaining building.\n\n\n", "id": "7712144", "categories": ["Textile mills in the United States", "Buildings and structures in Middletown, Connecticut", "Landmarks in Connecticut", "Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut", "National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Connecticut", "Industrial buildings completed in 1836"], "title": "Russell Company Upper Mill"}

It was originally built by Henry \"Father\" Willis and most recently rebuilt by Mander Organs, having 147 stops and 9,997 speaking pipes.\n\nThe original organ was built by Henry Willis & Sons in 1871. It had four manuals and 111 stops and was, at that time, the largest in the world.\n\nThe Durham firm of Harrison & Harrison rebuilt the organ in two stages in 1924 and 1933, during which it was increased to 146 stops (including three percussion stops) and converted to electro-pneumatic action. It was still the largest organ in Britain at that time. The 2014 Pink Floyd album \"The Endless River\", includes a track, \"Autumn '68\", featuring a recording of band member Richard Wright playing the organ in 1969.\n\nIn the 1970s, Harrisons refurbished the console and replaced the switchgear in the action, made minor changes to the voicing and added a roof to attempt to project the sound forward, which was not successful. One interesting note in this period is that composer Wendy Carlos featured the organ during the closing title sequence of the 1982 Disney science fiction film \"Tron\", performed by organist Martin Neary.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the organ was again in a state of disrepair, with an ever-increasing number of stops unusable due to leaks in the wind system, cracks in the soundboards, and other problems. By 2002, it was maintained only through \"heroic efforts\" on the part of Harrisons and could not be used at all without their staff present, in case of mishap. The wind chests and pipes were leaking noisily and wind pressure was insufficient to support full use. The leatherwork in the actions was also failing.\n\nIn 2002, the organ was taken out of commission for an extensive rebuild by Mander Organs. Some consideration was given to restoring the organ to its original Willis specification, but the subsequent alterations and enlargements had made this impractical. The organ was by now, in truth, a Harrison, not a Willis, instrument, and it was felt that it should remain essentially as-is.\n\nThe dryness of the Hall had damaged the soundboards, so these were replaced and new and larger wind trunks provided. The roof was removed, and the reed stops in the Great division were restored to their 1924 wind pressures. The 1970s split of the Great Organ (allowing two independent Great Organs to be registered and played simultaneously on different manuals) was rationalised, effectively offering separate Willis and Harrison choruses; also a Fourniture IV was added, bringing the total to 147 stops and 9,997 speaking pipes. For a few years the organ was once again the largest in the UK, until in 2007 the distinction passed to the organ in Liverpool Anglican Cathedral (10,268 pipes).\n\nThe organ was re-opened at a gala concert on the evening of 26 June 2004 with David Briggs, John Scott and Thomas Trotter playing, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Richard Hickox. The organ featured prominently in the 2004 BBC Proms series. The first recordings on the newly rebuilt instrument were by Dame Gillian Weir. The instrument has also been used by progressive rock band Muse when playing Megalomania, originally recorded on another Willis organ, at the church of Saint Mary in Bathwick. During a live performance at the Royal Albert Hall on the 12 April 2008, Muse's frontman, Matt Bellamy, had commented that \"since we're here, it would be rude not to play this beast\".\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7712161", "categories": ["Individual pipe organs"], "title": "Royal Albert Hall Organ"}

Forest Glade forms a large section of the Windsor's border with Tecumseh, Ontario and is situated near the former town of Riverside, Ontario. It has an estimated population of 19,000 people. The physical borders of the community are Tecumseh Road East to the North, Banwell Road to the East, Lauzon Road to the West, and E.C. Row Expressway to the South.\n\nAccess to and from Forest Glade is from three directions: West (off Lauzon Parkway), North (off Tecumseh Road East), and West (off Banwell Road). Nearby to a Tecumseh Road entrance is an entrance to the Ganatchio Trail, as well as a multitude of fast food restaurants, Tecumseh Mall, and several grocery stores. It has quick access to E.C. Row Expressway and is home to the furthest-East sections of Transit Windsors 1C, 1CX, 4, and 10 bus routes, providing excellent access to virtually anywhere in the city.\n\nForest Glade features an Optimist Club, twin ice pads at Forest Glade Arena, along with the Forest Glade branch of the Windsor Public Library. Also notable are a public skate park, baseball diamonds, and tennis courts. These facilities collectively are referred to as the Forest Glade Community Centre.\n\nThere are three public elementary schools in the area: Forest Glade Public School, Parkview Public School, and Eastwood Public School. In addition to these, there are two Catholic school board schools: L.A. Desmarais and H.J. Lassaline.\n\nHousing in Forest Glade generally consists of freestanding single family homes, owned as opposed to rented. There are a number of apartment buildings, but the majority of the population of the area live in houses. Numerous churches and religious places are present in the community. A shopping plaza, or small strip mall, is located near the Community Centre.\n\nAlthough Forest Glade, or simply \"The Glade\" is an official part of the City of Windsor, many residents show a sense of patriotism that would suggest it were an independent town.\n\nForest Glade is well known amongst Windsorites for having many winding and confusing roads. It is very easy to get lost in Forest Glade as there are lots of crescents and some of the streets even intersect themselves. Numerous crescent-type streets are renamed halfway along them, making navigation for people unfamiliar with the area difficult at best.\n\nThe community is an example of a planned community, as until the late 1960s, the area was mainly farmland, with fewer than a dozen houses in the area. The community was built in stages throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, with most of the available land between the road boundaries being used.

His is the story of a farm boy who responded to the call of the far horizon to become a world citizen and a Christian witness to the uttermost part of the earth.\n\nThe Pleasant Valley neighborhood, though a tiny dot on the map, was in fact singularly cosmopolitan. Early settlers had come from many eastern States, and some directly from England, the Netherlands and Germany. This diversity may have placed in this boy's mind the idea of the bigness of the world.\n\nAlfred was the son of Cornelius Howard, who was born in Michigan in 1841. His mother was Harriett Guilford. Alfred's paternal grandfather was of English lineage, arriving in Michigan from White Plains, New York. His paternal grandmother was Margaret Osterhut of Dutch descent.\n\nCornelius was deeply involved and powerfully loyal to the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. He was a frequent lay member to the St. Joseph Annual Conference, twice to the General Conference, and served for ten years as a Trustee of Otterbein College. Harriett Howard was likewise devoted, if unobtrusive in her religious expression. As a boy Alfred was uplifted by the sound of his mother's voice raised in prayer as she went about her housework.\n\nAlfred's favorite reading in boyhood was the \"Youth's Companion\", a weekly magazine for young people, filled with hair-raising tales of Indian fights on the frontier. As a man Alfred expressed regret that those exciting stories always assumed the Indians had no rights on the land where they were reared and on which their ancestors had lived for generations.\n\nAlfred attended country school, then the Schoolcraft High School, four miles from his home. His favorite high school subject was physical geography. He also enjoyed physiology, which prompted in him for many years the desire to study medicine. At the age of eighteen he taught school one year in his neighborhood. The next year he taught near Davenport, Nebraska.\n\nYoung Alfred was often encouraged to attend college. One of his encouragers was his pastor, the Rev. J. L. Parks. Thus, it was decided that Alfred should attend Roanoke Classical Seminary in Indiana. The Principal was Professor D. N. Howe, a graduate of Otterbein and of the Union Biblical Seminary in Dayton, Ohio (now United Theological Seminary). Alfred enjoyed these college preparatory studies under Professor Howe. After this one year, however, because the Roanoke Seminary moved to North Manchester, Indiana, Alfred decided to attend Otterbein in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nThe autumn of 1889 found Alfred Howard, at the age of twenty-one, enrolled in the academy of Otterbein College. One year later he matriculated to the college itself. His days at Otterbein were happy ones, and he never tired in later years of relating his college memories. Alfred was an earnest student, with a mind thirsty for truth, a characteristic he retained the rest of his life. Nevertheless, bad eyesight severely handicapped him, and he had great difficulty getting glasses which fit properly.\n\nHeredity and an active farm upbringing gave Alfred a powerful physique. In college, he played varsity football, alternating between center and guard. Frequently he was pivot man in the famous \"flying wedge.\"\n\nAlfred sang first tenor in the Otterbein Quartet, the first of a series of such organizations in the history of the college. On one occasion the quartet sang at the church of W. W. Williamson, who had a son John. The latter was fascinated by the singing collegians and vowed to also some day go to Otterbein and sing in the quartet. In due time John Finley Williamson did both, and much more than that. He continued his musical interests after graduation, organizing a choir and a choir school: founding the Westminster Choir College in Dayton, Ohio, (presently in Princeton, New Jersey), which became world famous.\n\nOne year Alfred directed the Presbyterian Church choir in Marion, Ohio, traveling from Otterbein each weekend. The pastor was a Rev. Mr. Thomas, whose young son Norman became well acquainted with Alfred. Later Norman Thomas also became a Presbyterian minister, but is better known as the frequent candidate for President of the United States on the Socialist ticket.\n\nThe Young Men's Christian Association on the Otterbein campus made a rich contribution to Alfred Howard's life. S. D. Gordon was state secretary of college Y.M.C.A. work in Ohio at that time, and John R. Mott and Robert E. Speer, young men just out of Cornell and Princeton, respectively, were frequent speakers at Y.M.C.A. conferences.\n\nIn 1890 at one such conference John R. Mott made an address which engraved three unforgotten sentences on young Howard's mind:\nOne summer Alfred even attended the famous college Y.M.C.A. conference at Northfield, Massachusetts.\n\nHoward met May Day Stevenson at Otterbein. They conducted their courtship on the campus, but he proposed to her one summer by letter.\n\nAlfred and May were married on their graduation day: 15 June 1894, in the home of Professor Henry Garst, who performed the ceremony in the presence of many college friends. Soon thereafter the happy couple were on the high seas sailing for the mission field in Africa.\n\nAlfred Taylor Howard was deeply religious. He believed profoundly in the efficacy of prayer. As a boy he had formed the habit of prayer, and as a college student prayed regularly. In later life, while taking long walks, he would pray for long lists of persons and causes, setting aside certain days of the week for various portions of his long prayer lists.\n\nToward the end of his college days, Alfred wondered about what his life-work should be. So he made this a matter for prayer. During the summer before his senior year, while working on his father's farm, he chose a certain empty stall in the barn as his \"quiet place\" for daily intercession. Later he wrote, \"\"I do not know when in my life I ever prayed more earnestly for definite guidance.\"\"\n\nIn his handwritten memoirs, found after his death, he tells of the outcome of his prayer:\n\n", "id": "7712231", "categories": ["Bishops of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ", "Otterbein University", "American Methodist missionaries", "Methodist missionaries in Sierra Leone", "Ministers of the Evangelical United Brethren Church", "American expatriates in Sierra Leone", "1868 births", "American Methodist bishops", "Evangelical United Brethren missionaries", "Year of death missing"], "title": "Alfred Taylor Howard"}

He took over control of Lúlóng Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) in 810 after killing his father Liú Jì (劉濟) as well as his brother Liú Gǔn (劉緄), and thereafter ruled the circuit \"de facto\" independently from the imperial government. In 821, he submitted the circuit to imperial control and took tonsure to be a Buddhist monk. He died shortly after.\n\nIt is not known when Liu Zong was born. He was the second son of Liu Ji, who ruled Lulong Circuit as its military governor (\"Jiedushi\") starting in 785 (when he succeeded Liu Zong's grandfather Liu Peng). Liu Zong's older brother Liu Gun was considered Liu Ji's heir, and during Liu Ji's rule was made deputy military governor, then considered the post for the heir among warlords who controlled their circuits \"de facto\" independently from the imperial government. Liu Zong was made the prefect of Ying Prefecture (瀛州, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei). Liu Zong was described by the \"Old Book of Tang\" to be treacherous.\n\nIn 810, Liu Ji was commanding his Lulong troops in attacking Wang Chengzong, the ruler of neighboring Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), whom Emperor Xianzong had declared a renegade. He had Liu Gun remain at Lulong's capital You Prefecture (幽州) to serve as acting military governor, while Liu Zong accompanied him on the campaign, serving as the army commander. During the campaign against Wang, Liu Ji had Liu Zong command the siege of Anping (安平, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), and Anping fell in one day. However, the Lulong army became bogged down at Raoyang (饒陽, in modern Hengshui) and was not able to advance further.\n\nMeanwhile, Liu Ji grew ill during the campaign. Liu Zong conspired with Liu Ji's assistant Zhang Qi (張玘), treasurer Cheng Guobao (成國寶), and other officers, to take over power. He had people pretend to be imperial messengers arrive at the Lulong army's camp to state, \"As the imperial government sees that you, Lord Chancellor, refuse to advance any further, the Deputy Military Governor has been made military governor.\" The next day, he had another person state, \"The Deputy Military Governor's banner has already arrived at Taiyuan.\" Later on, he had another person state, \"The banner has gone past Dai Prefecture [(代州, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi)].\" The army was shocked by these developments. Liu Ji himself was shocked and incensed, and he killed tens of officers who were friendly with Liu Gun. He also sent messengers to You Prefecture, ordering Liu Gun to report to the Lulong army's camp, while making Zhang Qi's brother Zhang Gao (張皋) take over the headquarters. It was said that due to his anger, Liu Ji did not eat on that day from morning to noon, and when he grew thirsty and asked for a drink, Liu Zong handed him a poisoned drink. On August 20, 810, Liu Ji died from the poison. At Liu Gun travelled from You Prefecture to Zhuo Prefecture (涿州, in modern Baoding, Hebei), Liu Zong issued an order in Liu Ji's name, ordering that Liu Gun be caned to death. Liu Zong then took over the control of the circuit. As the imperial government did not know all that had occurred, Liu Zong was made military governor. He was also created the Duke of Chu.\n\nIn 816, as Emperor Xianzong waged another campaign against Wang Chengzong, Liu Zong mobilized his troops and captured Chengde's town Wuqiang (武強, in modern Hengshui). He also put Leshou (樂壽, in modern Cangzhou) under siege. In response, Emperor Xianzong gave him the honorary chancellor title of \"Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi\" (同中書門下平章事). However, it was said that Liu then effective sat on the fence and did not advance further, and as the regulations at the time were that once a circuit's army advanced out of its borders on an imperially-sanctioned campaign, the imperial treasury would be responsible for its expenses, the Lulong army's supplies were costly to the imperial treasury. With the other armies against Chengde also not making much advances, in 817, Emperor Xianzong abandoned the campaign against Chengde and ordered the circuits' armies to return to their own circuits.\n\nIn 817, Wang's ally Wu Yuanji, who ruled Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), was defeated and captured by the imperial general Li Su. In fear, Wang submitted to imperial authority and surrendered two of his six prefectures to imperial control. In the aftermaths of Wang's actions, Liu's officer Tan Zhong (譚忠) persuaded him to also submit to imperial authority.\n\nMeanwhile, it was said that Liu Zong, after he had killed his father and brother, had often been fearful in his heart, and at times he saw his father and brother in his dreams. He often gave food to several hundred Buddhist monks at his headquarters and had them hold religious ceremonies, and after he finished his day of work he would retreat to a room near the ceremonies. If he did not, then he would not be able to sleep. Seeing that the other circuits had all submitted to imperial authority, in 821 (when Emperor Xianzong's son Emperor Muzong was emperor), he requested to resign and become a Buddhist monk himself. He also requested an award to the soldiers, while ordering a number of officers that he felt were difficult to control, including Zhu Kerong (the grandson of a former military governor, Zhu Tao) to report to Chang'an, hoping that the imperial government would give them proper discipline and rewards such that they would become faithful to the imperial government. He further recommended that Lulong be divided into three circuits and recommended Zhang Hongjing, Xue Ping, and Lu Shimei (盧士玫) to take over the three circuits.\n\nIn response to Liu's proposal, Emperor Muzong gave a number of Liu's relatives honored titles, issued a money reward to the Lulong soldiers, and further issued two alternative edicts — one bestowing the dharma name of Dajue on Liu Zong, granting him a temple named Bao'en Temple (報恩寺), and giving him special purple monk robes; and one making him the military governor of Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and giving him the honorary chancellor title of \"Shizhong\" (侍中). He had his eunuchs deliver the two edicts to Liu Zong, to let Liu Zong decide which edict he would accept. However, before the edicts could arrive at You Prefecture, Liu Zong took tonsure and became a monk, and he prepared to depart You Prefecture. Some soldiers refused to let him leave, and he executed some 10 of the leaders and gave his seals to Zhang Qi, making Zhang the acting military governor. He then left in the middle of the night, and only in the morning did the soldiers find out. Zhang submitted a report stating, \"I do not know where Liu Zong is by this point.\" On May 2, Liu Zong, who was by then in Ding Prefecture (定州, in modern Baoding), died.\n\n", "id": "7712247", "categories": ["821 deaths", "Tang dynasty Buddhist monks", "8th-century births", "Tang dynasty jiedushi of Lulong Circuit"], "title": "Liu Zong"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712262", "text": "Lyon-class battleship\n\nThe \"Lyon\" class was a proposed battleship class which was planned for the French Navy in 1913, with construction scheduled to begin in 1915. The class was to have comprised four ships: \"Lyon\", \"Lille\", \"Duquesne\", and \"Tourville\". The first two were named for cities in France, while the rest honored French admirals Abraham Duquesne and Anne Hilarion de Tourville. The design was an improvement on the previous , and mounted a fourth quadruple-gun turret, for a total of sixteen guns. Construction was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 before any of the ships could be laid down.\n\nStarting in 1910, the French Navy began a dreadnought battleship construction program, starting with the four ships of the that year. The three-ship was authorized the next year, and five s followed in 1912. Design work began in 1912; the design staff submitted several proposals for the new battleships, with displacements ranged from to . In 1913, the Navy authorized a fourth class of battleships, what was to have been the \"Lyon\" class, scheduled for 1915.\n\nOne of the main considerations for the new design was the armament to be carried. The French were aware that the latest British battleships—the —were to be armed with guns, prompting significant consideration to match the caliber for the \"Lyon\" design. The design staff prepared four variants, two armed with the standard French gun in twin or quadruple gun turrets, and two armed with 380 mm guns in twin turrets. The designers also briefly considered a ship armed with twenty guns in quadruple turrets, but the decrease in gun caliber was deemed to be a step in the wrong direction and it was quickly rejected. At the time, the French Navy believed that at the expected battle ranges in the Mediterranean, the 340 mm gun was effective and so the larger 380 mm gun was not necessary. In addition, the design staff determined the 38 cm gun would take too long to design, so the proposals that incorporated these weapons were cancelled and settled on one of the two 34 cm proposals. The first proposal, which mounted fourteen guns, was a ship long. On 24 November 1913, the design staff instead chose the slightly larger second design, armed with sixteen guns in four quadruple turrets, but the specific 34 cm gun to be used to arm the ships was still an open question.\n\nThe first proposal by the Directorate of Artillery () was for the existing 45-caliber gun used by the \"Brétagne\" and \"Normandie\"-class ships be modified to use a slightly longer shell that weighed ( more than the existing shell) and was optimized for underwater performance. The second proposal was for a 50-caliber gun that fired a larger, shell. Accommodating the extra volume and weight of the longer gun was estimated to increase the displacement of the design to and to increase the cost from 87 million francs to 93–96 million. The first option was ultimately selected in February 1914. The first two ships, \"Lyon\" and \"Lille\", were scheduled to be ordered on 1 January 1915, and \"Duquesne\" and \"Tourville\" would have followed on 1 April 1915. \n\nWorld War I broke out in July 1914, however, and shifting military requirements, particularly for the army, forced the cancellation of the class. The mobilization in July greatly impeded construction as those workmen in the reserves were called to the colors, stripping the shipyards that would have built the ships of many of the skilled workers necessary to begin construction. Additionally, industrial capacity was redirected to weapons and munition orders from the army. In light of such constraints, the navy decided that only those ships that could be completed quickly would be worked upon, like the \"Brétagne\"s.\n\nThe ships would have been long between perpendiculars and long overall. They would have had a beam of and a draft of . Their displacement was estimated at . The propulsion system had not been settled by the time the class was cancelled; the design staff proposed either the mixed steam turbine and triple-expansion engine system used in the first four ships of the preceding \"Normandie\" class or the all-turbine system used in the last Normandie-class ship, in a memo dated 13 September 1913. They also considered new geared turbines that had proved satisfactory in the new destroyer . The final design called for a propulsion system rated at with a top speed of . An unknown number of boilers were trunked into two funnels amidships.\n\nThe main battery of the \"Lyon\"s would have been sixteen 34 cm Modèle 1912M guns mounted in four quadruple-gun turrets. They would have all been mounted on the centerline, although the arrangement is not clear. A preliminary sketch, attached to the design staff's memo of 19 September 1913, showed one turret was placed forward, one amidships, and two in a superfiring pair aft. The contemporary \"Journal of United States Artillery\", however, suggests the turrets would have been mounted in two superfiring pairs, forward and aft. The turrets weighed , and were electrically trained and hydraulically elevated. The guns were divided into pairs and mounted in twin cradles; a thick bulkhead divided the turrets. Each pair of guns had its own ammunition hoist and magazine. They could be fired simultaneously or independently. Beginning before work on the \"Lyon\" class had started, the French Navy had begun experimenting with new types of shells. After learning that shells had penetrated the hull of battleships through the water to burst below their armored belts during the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1904 and during British gunnery trials in 1907, the French Navy began investigating how they might optimize shell design to improve their performance through the water. By 1913 the navy believed that it had a design that could accurate through the water for a distance of . \n\nThe secondary armament was to consist of twenty-four guns, either the 55-caliber 138.6 mm Modèle 1910 or a new automatic model, each singly-mounted in casemates in the hull sides. The M1910 guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The ships would also have been equipped with a pair of anti-aircraft guns and six torpedo tubes of unknown size, submerged in the hull.\n\nThe ships would have been protected with a modified version of the armor layout of the earlier \"Normandie\" class. The primary alterations was that the upper strake of armor intended to protect the secondary armament was reduced from to to compensate for the additional armor below the waterline to better protect the hull against \"diving\" shells. The waterline armor belt would have been thick between the barbettes of the end turrets. The turrets were also intended to be protected with an armor thickness of 300 millimeters on their faces. The lower armored deck would have consisted of a total of of mild steel; the deck sloped downwards to meet the bottom of the waterline belt and the sloped portion of the deck would have had a total thickness of . The upper armored deck was intended to be . Between the end barbettes, below the waterline belt, the thickness of the hull would have graduated from in thickness down to a depth of below the waterline forward and aft.\n\n", "id": "7712262", "categories": ["Proposed ships", "Battleship classes"], "title": "Lyon-class battleship"}

Recently village students have also got other options of private or public schools in Khurja and nearby places. It is very unfortunate and sad that there are not many students who are academically doing good in the village. This is because of the deteriorating condition of state government schools.\n\nThe import thing is that the villagers put a lot of importance on the education of girls which is a very good sign for the whole society. It has been noticed in the recent past that sometimes girls' academic performance is better than boys and a number of girls are pursuing higher education. A fact worth mentioning is that few families have moved to nearby town just for their daughter's higher education as there is no degree college in the vicinity.\n\nThere is One B.A.M.S College has opened in this village and people come from outside to complete their study .Which is very good news about the village and its people.It is about to open a degree college in this village very soon.\n\nThere is a Language School is about to open where students of this village and around could take the advantage of this.\n\nThe village has a post office.

There are couple of tube wells as well. In case of shortage of canal's water or electricity, sometimes the farmers are compelled to use ground water pumped using diesel engines which becomes a very costly affair.\n\nThe village low income population is also dependent on the industries around the village like potteries, dairy and iron rods fabrication factory.

They show dark bodies and darkened colouration at the wingbase which helps them warm faster using the sun.\n\nAlthough classified under the swallowtail butterfly family, none of the \"Parnassius\" species possesses tails.\n\nThe larvae feed on species of plants belonging to the Papaveraceae and Crassulaceae families, and like the other swallowtail butterfly larvae, possess an osmeterium.

The exact number of species within the genus is disputed and numbers range from 38 to 47.\n\nThe \"Parnassius\" butterflies also have a peculiar reproductive strategy in that the male has special accessory glands that produce a mating plug that seals the female genitalia after mating. This is believed to ensure the success of the male and to prevent other males from mating and avoids sperm competition.\n\nButterflies of this genus have been widely used models to study metapopulations, population genetics and gene flow.

It is regarded as one of two most important Knesset committees (the other being the Finance Committee).\n\nThe majority of the committee's activity takes place in its subcommittees, while the committee as a whole largely serves as a media stage for top defense decision makers. The committee approves extensive subcommittee-drafted delegated legislation in areas of defense, emergency preparedness, emergency recruitment of human resources, Shabak special operations, allocation of emergency equipment, the deployment of the Home Front, and other security and intelligence related tasks. The committee is presented with summaries by the top decision makers in areas of foreign affairs, defense, and intelligence, including by the Prime Minister, the Foreign Affairs Minister, the Minister of Defense, and the heads of Mossad, Shabak, and Aman. The committee's chair, who reports on much of the country's defense activities, is considered one of the most senior figures in the Security Forces and subsequently, it is one of the most sought after positions in the Knesset. The committee's plenary sessions are secret and the meetings of some of its subcommittees are top secret. Consequently, its protocols remain largely unpublished. After repeated instances in which the contents of meetings were leaked, its members became obliged to sign a secrecy affidavit. The media has limited access to committee meetings (at selected occasions) and no access to that of its subcommittees. The government is obligated to bring to the approval of the committee various emergency activities, including ones related to or that are likely to result in war. The committee also undertakes personal hearings for key defense and State decision makers as well as hearings for appreciable defense projects.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7712380", "categories": ["Legislative branch of Israel", "Israeli Security Forces", "Foreign relations of Israel"], "title": "Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee"}

He lived in Hilversum from the age of five.\nLuyendijk studied in Kansas, Amsterdam, and Cairo. He earned his Master's degree equivalent \"doctoraal\" degree in Cairo. His first book \"Een goede man slaat soms zijn vrouw\" (1998, \"A Good Man Sometimes Beats His Wife\") is about the Egyptian society from a Western observer's point of view.\n\nHe eventually became a news correspondent for various Netherlands-based media organisations in the Middle East for a number of years. He was based in Egypt, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. He also reported on the Second Gulf War in Iraq. His book \"Het zijn net mensen\" (2006, \"They're just like people\") is a report of his experiences as a news correspondent in the Middle East, and quickly became a bestseller in the Netherlands. The book has since been translated and published in Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Australia, the US, France and Slovenia. The title in English is \"Fit to Print\" (Australia), \"Hello, Everybody!\" (UK) or \"People Like Us\" (US).\n\nIn \"People Like Us\", Luyendijk tells the story of his five years as a correspondent in the Middle East. He chronicles first-hand experiences of dictatorship, occupation, terror, and war. His stories cast light on a number of major crises, from the Iraq War to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, along with less-reported issues such as underage orphan trash-collectors in Cairo. The more he witnessed, the less he understood, and he became increasingly aware of the yawning gap between what he saw on the ground and what was later reported in the media.\n\nFrom 2006, Joris Luyendijk was living in Amsterdam. In the summer of 2006 and 2007 he carried out interviews for the in-depth interview programme \"Zomergasten\" (\"Summer Guests\") on VPRO. From January 2010, he held the Leonardo Chair at the University of Tilburg, and taught the masterclass “Journalism for the 21st Century”. Luyendijk studied Arabic in Amsterdam and Cairo.\n\nIn September 2010 Joris Luyendijk was asked to shadow the Dutch Parliament and government in The Hague for a month, resulting in a book on Dutch politics, titled \"Je hebt het niet van mij, maar...\" (\"You didn't hear it from me, but...\"). From 2011 Luyendijk was based in London where he worked for \"The Guardian\". In 2017 he returned to the Netherlands, citing Brexit as the reason. In \"The Joris Luyendijk Banking Blog\" he provided an anthropological perspective on the financial world. In Dutch-language newspapers \"NRC Handelsblad\" and \"De Standaard\" Luyendijk commented weekly on his life in the City.

It is significant for its Victorian viaduct, which crosses the Colne valley.\n\nThe present name of \"Chappel\" derives from the construction of a small chapel of ease, noted in 1285 AD as standing at the northern boundary of the parish of Great Tey. During the 16th century, because of concerns from Chappel residents about the distance to Great Tey's own church at festival time, this area was split from the parish and become a separate entity known as \"Pontisbright\" (lit. \"Britric's bridge\") that would eventually become known as \"Chappel\".\n\nIn 1433, the vicar of Great Tey agreed that the inhabitants of Chappel could find and elect their own chaplain. The benefice itself was united with that of the neighbouring village of Wakes Colne in 1938. The chapel itself, now the parish church of St Barnabas, is a grade I listed building.\n\nThe Chappel viaduct was built between 1847 and 1849 for the Colchester and Stour extension of the Eastern Counties Railway. Originally planned to be a timber structure, the viaduct was built of locally made brick because of the additional cost of maintaining a timber structure. Approximately 600 men were involved in the construction, most of whom were local East Anglians. The cost of construction was approximately £21,000 (approximately £2.2 million in 2016 money).\n\nThe viaduct consists of 32 arches of span, with a total length of , and a maximum height of . The piers consist of two shafts, separated by a opening, and joined at top and bottom by arches; each shaft contain a hollow void by maximum, partially filled with concrete to the level of the bottom arch. The running level of the viaduct has a gradient of 1 in 120\n\nThe viaduct became a listed monument in 1967, and is thought to be the second-largest brick-built structure in England after Battersea Power Station.\n\nDuring the commemoration events to mark 50 years since the end of the Second World War, Chappel's beacon was transported by rail to a point on the viaduct where it could be seen from the playing field below, and lit after a ceremonial silence, the beginning and end of which were marked by the release of two maroons.\n\nThe first passenger train to Sudbury, carrying an official party from Colchester, ran on 2 July 1849. The viaduct currently carries the Marks Tey to Sudbury branch railway (Gainsborough Line), which connects regularly with trains to and from London's Liverpool Street Station.\n\nThe village has a pub dating from the 13th century, a parish church, a United Reformed church, a post office and general store, village hall and a railway station, Chappel and Wakes Colne station, which houses the East Anglian Railway Museum. It also has a children's play area which was upgraded in 2007-08 by Chappel Parish Council.\n\nIn celebration of the millennium, the Chappel Millennium Green was opened. The Millennium Green has two areas: a nature reserve with board walk and a mown grass area for general recreation isbordered by a gravel path. It has also hosted several events, including the burning of a beacon and Colne Valley Festival events.\n\nChappel's village sign depicts a bridge crossing a river, symbolic of the old bridge, dating from 1140 AD, which crossed the river Colne and connected the two halves of the estate of Crepping Manor. The lord of the manor was, at that time, responsible for its upkeep.\n\n\n", "id": "7712449", "categories": ["Villages in Essex"], "title": "Chappel"}

They started playing in 2005 and have released 1 album, 3 singles and 2 live-albums. Their music have been described to sound like \"electronic space-romance\" and \"ambient movie score music\", but they’ve changed genre to more synth oriented music.\n\nSome artists that have inspired the music of Sywnthkrawft are Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode and Ralph Lundsten.\n\nWilliam Johansson, Daniel Thyberg, Gustav Jacobsson and Viktor Jacobsson created the band in the summer of 2005, after long discussions of starting a band. The first recordings were of a session of improvised playing. Three songs were recorded from this session, \"Das Piraten auf der Mondlicht\", \"Das Überman Ist Spät\" and \"Der Kalinka\".\n\nAfter some sessions of only improvised music William Johansson and Daniel Thyberg started to write and record songs (Later, some of these songs would feature on their first album Cornea). One of these songs, called \"Approaching Atmosphere\" was considered to be released on single. The band even recorded a music video to the track, one problem was that only three of the four members were featured in the video which made some confusion of their line-up.\n\nAfter some recording sessions the band was ready to release their first album called \"Die Autobahn auf Earth\". But the material was to badly recorded (most of the tracks were recorded live in the studio with only a microphone in the middle) and then the idea of releasing this material was turned down. But it would later turn out that most of these songs ended up on their soon to come album Cornea (but then rerecorded and remade).\n\nA video where Sywnthkrawft played most materials live in their studio was recorded. This video footage was later destroyed and cannot be restored again. The only known songs that were recorded on the video was \"Approaching Atmosphere\", \"Das Piraten auf der Mondlicht\", \"Making Adjustments\", \"Space\" and \"Armageddon Apocalypse\" (which is the only song whom could be restored from the destroyed footage).\n\nIn the beginning of 2006 William Johansson decided to review the recorded material from the previous year and decided to remake the best songs. So the band gathered again to re-record their old songs with much better equipment than before. The sound became much more atmospheric and ambient than before. The old single \"\"Approaching Atmosphere\"\" would become one of the opening tracks of the album. The recordings took almost three months to become ready. It also took another month to get everything mastered, by Geoff Swartz. The album was going to be called \"Cornea\".\n\nThe album got a pretty neutral reception from the critics. Some called the music “electronic space-romance” and “surreal, ambient and some kind of electronica”. The epic track \"\"Night Flight\"\" and \"\"S.A.Z.A.\"\" were considered to be the best songs on the album while \"\"Children\"\" was considered to be the worst song by far.\n\nFollowing the release of the album a live show was about to take place. A lot of songs were rehearsed and not only songs from the new album but also other songs, even old tracks from the first recording sessions. William Johansson and Daniel Thyberg even wrote lyrics to some of their songs. The ones that got lyrics were \"\"The Greeting\"\", \"\"Extermination\"\", \"\"Das Piraten auf der Mondlicht\"\" and \"\"Grace from Space\"\" (the two mentioned first were two tracks from the early days of Sywnthkrawft). There were also rumours that the controversial song \"\"Afrika\"\" was rehearsed, but that’s not confirmed.\n\nAt the time of the concert only one in the band (William) had a keyboard so Gustav Jacobsson and Viktor Jacobsson had to borrow two keyboards while Daniel Thyberg played electric guitar. The concert didn’t go very good, mostly because of technical problems. The critics said that the concert were \"horrible\" and \"a waste of time\". The positive response were that the songs, who were from the album Cornea, were heavily rearranged and that the new songs were pretty decent. The best received track was a new song called “Hypernova”.\n\nAnother problem according to the band was that their songs were to long and monotonous. The well received songs were those who are not featured on the album. The same day a live-album, called \"Chaos at Caoz\", was released in very few numbers, and is almost impossible to find today. Also a new single was released, \"\"Making Adjustments\"\". A new music video was made and the b-side was the live performance of \"\"Hypernova\"\". The single got a very cold reception because the critics didn’t want Sywnthkrawft to succeed after their horrible concert.\n\nThey went back into the studio and recorded some songs (most notably \"\"Spaceblades\"\", \"\"Rings of Saturn\"\" and a remake of an old song from one of the first session recordings called \"\"Paul Newman\"\"). A setlist were also made for a new concert where the most notably material was a new version of \"\"Night Flight\"\" and a new song called \"\"Saguaroxx\"\". After these recordings and the concert the band withdrew and stopped making music for a while.\n\nAfter a time of absence William and Daniel came together and tried to write some new songs but only came up with one, \"\"Erecto Plasma\"\". Later William wrote some new songs himself but also revived some of the songs they recorded before their withdrawal. A new EP was made of five songs. But this EP was never released and William went back to the studio to write more songs.\n\nAfter an absence Daniel decided to leave the group. But William, Gustav and Viktor kept playing and creating new music. The group decided to release a new album called \"\"Goodbye, Spaceblade\"\" and they started to create more tracks. One of these tracks, \"\"The Photographer’s Exceptional Pictures for Body and Mind\"\", was released as a single and gained some fame and controversy.\n\nLater they competed in a competition called Garagerocken 2006 where they ended tied for 4th place (A live album of the show was released, \"Tuxedo Junction\"). The new studio album was supposed to be released in late 2006, but after problems with finding a producer, the release had to be postponed to May 2007. The style of music was a huge step away from their latest album, \"Cornea\". All of the songs on the new album are written by William Johansson.\n\nAt the beginning of 2007 they competed in Musik Direkt where a jury didn't qualify them to the final. After the announcement, the audience showed their dissatisfaction of the result by sending mails to the arrangers and complaining on different forums on the Internet. Many thought they should’ve got a wild card to the final.\n\nThey gained some fame & controversy for their single \"The Photographer’s Exceptional Pictures for Body and Mind\". On 8 March 2007, it debuted on #1 in the Swedish chart Dalatoppen. They’re known for playing a mix of non-album songs and songs featured on different releases on their live concerts. They also use an exclusive pre-recorded text read by radio and television celebrity Hans Villius as introduction to their concerts.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007 they’ve decided to take a two-month break from performing and instead William has started to work with remakes of all the songs they used to perform live. Rumors say that all the songs on \"Goodbye, Spaceblade\" were remade and might end up as an album. William has also started to work on new material for a new Sywnthkrawft album with the working title \"SK3 The Space Musical\".\n\n", "id": "7712513", "categories": ["Swedish musical groups"], "title": "Sywnthkrawft"}

One of the important milestones in the Pope's efforts included a religious and peaceful initiative called A Common Word. This was provoked by an ill-conceived 2006 lecture he delivered at a university in Regensburg, Germany, which prompted Muslim leaders to gather and make overtures to their Christian and Jewish counterparts. Later on, Pope Benedict pursued key initiatives that helped foster Christian and Muslim dialogue. These were founded on the Pope's belief that Christians and Muslims have shared religious experience and that Christianity and Islam are both theologically founded in \"God's irruptive call ... heard in the midst of man's ordinary daily existence.\"\n\nThe Pope strongly condemned the Mohammed cartoons, first published by a Danish newspaper and later in other European papers, saying \"In the international context we are living at present, the Catholic Church continues convinced that, to foster peace and understanding between peoples and men, it is necessary and urgent that religions and their symbols be respected.\" He also added that this implies that \"believers [of various religions] not be the object of provocations that wound their lives and religious sentiments.\" Pope Benedict XVI noted that \"for believers, as for all people of good will, the only path that can lead to peace and fraternity is respect for the convictions and religious practices of others.\"\n\nPope Benedict XVI has called for Christians as \"to open their arms and hearts\" to Muslim immigrants and \"to dialogue\" with them on religious issues. The Pope told participants that the Catholic Church is \"increasingly aware\" that \"interreligious dialogue is a part of its commitment to the service of humanity in the modern world.\" In fact, this \"conviction\" has become \"the daily bread\" of those who work with migrants, refugees and itinerant peoples, he said. Pope Benedict described this dialogue between Christians and Muslims as \"important and delicate\". Many communities have experienced this, he said, as they worked \"to build relations of mutual knowledge and respect with (Muslim) immigrants, which are extremely useful in overcoming prejudices and closed minds\". For this reason, he added, Christians \"are called to open their arms and hearts to everyone, whatever their country of origin, leaving the task of formulating appropriate laws for the promotion of healthy existence to the authorities responsible for public life\".\n\nOn September 11, 2006, the leaders of Muslim communities in Italy endorsed statements by Pope Benedict XVI who warned that Africa and Asia feel threatened by the West's materialism and secularism. \"We agree with the Pope,\" said Roberto Piccardo, the spokesman of Italy's largest Muslim group UCOII. \"It is true that Muslims are puzzled by a West which is hostage to a materialistic system.\" Mario Scialoja, the former president of the World Muslim League, also expressed support for the pope's words, saying that the \"West's exclusion of God leads to the wrong life models.\" On October 21 the Vatican for the first time released a document in Arabic, a speech of the Vatican UNESCO representative which addresses scientific and ethical issues. The next day the Pope sent his \"cordial greetings\" to Muslims as they celebrated the ending of the holy month of \"Ramadan\". \"I am happy to send cordial greetings to Muslims around the world who are these days celebrating the end of the Ramadan fasting month\", said the Pope at the Vatican.\"I send them all my wishes for serenity and peace\", he added. \n\nThe October 2006 edition of \"La Civiltà Cattolica\" – the authoritative magazine of the Rome Jesuits printed with the supervision and authorization of the Vatican authorities – opened with an editorial on Islam that furnished a very detailed and alarming description of fundamentalist and terrorist Islam, behind which “there are great and powerful Islamic states”: an Islam aiming at the conquest of the world and fostered by violence “for the cause of Allah\". But it does this without even the slightest note of criticism of this nexus of violence and faith. And it is as if this nexus were an inescapable reality, against which the West and the Church should do little or nothing: little at the practical level – it’s enough to look over the scant measures against terrorism that are recommended – and nothing at the theoretical level. For its part, the editorial seems to say that Islam is the way it is and must be accepted as such. \n\nOn November 10, 2006, Pope Benedict urged his fellow German Catholics to discuss their faith in Jesus Christ openly with the Muslims living there. The Pontiff said the Roman Catholic Church viewed Muslims \"with respect and good will. They mostly hold on to their religious convictions and rites with great seriousness and have a right to see our humble and strong witness for Jesus Christ\", he said after noting that modern German society had been largely secularized. \"To do this convincingly, we need to make serious efforts. So wherever there are many Muslims, there should be Catholics with sufficient knowledge of languages and Church history to enable them to talk with Muslims.\" The same month the Pope received in audience an Algerian Muslim philosopher known for his commitment to battling religious hatred. \"I was impressed by his welcome and attention, face to face,\" Mustapha Cherif, an expert on Islam at the University of Algiers, told the Zenit News Service. The Pope said dialogue among Christians, Muslims and Jews was vital and urged Christians in the Middle East not to abandon the region. \"Inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue is not just an option, but a vital necessity for our times\", he told members of a foundation on inter-religious dialogue. Christians needed to find \"the ties that unite\" them with the world's other two great monotheistic religions.\n\nCardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone said in an interview in an Italian newspaper that the Pontifical Council for Inter-Religious Dialogue, which specializes in relations with Muslims, would be made a separate office and no longer merged with the Vatican's cultural office.\n\nThe head of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Interfaith Dialogue said on March 26, 2006 that the war in Iraq should not be viewed as a \"crusade\" launched by Christian countries against Muslims, and that \"Western\" was not synonymous to \"Christian\". \"Pope Benedict XVI, like his predecessor John Paul II, never ceases to say this and show it by his acts, such as opposition to armed intervention in Iraq.\" He said that the church is not \"western\", but \"catholic\".\n\nPope Benedict XVI condemned pre-emptive war. It was the Pope's view that the invasion of Iraq \"has no moral justification\". As a cardinal, Benedict was critical about President George W. Bush's choice of sending an army into the heart of Islam to impose democracy. \"The damage would be greater than the values one hopes to save\", he concluded. He also said that \"The concept of preventive war does not appear in \"The Catechism of the Catholic Church\".\"\n\nThe Vatican condemned the execution of Saddam Hussein as a \"tragic\" event and warned that it risked fomenting a spirit of vendetta and sowing fresh violence in Iraq. \"A capital punishment is always tragic news, a reason for sadness, even if it deals with a person who was guilty of grave crimes,\" said Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi. \"The position of the Church (against capital punishment) has been restated often\", he said. \"The killing of the guilty party is not the way to reconstruct justice and reconcile society. On the contrary, there is a risk that it will feed a spirit of vendetta and sow new violence\", he said.\n\nAt Easter, Pope Benedict XVI lamented the continual slaughter in Iraq and unrest in Afghanistan as he denounced violence in the name of religion. \n\"Afghanistan is marked by growing unrest and instability, Benedict said. \"In the Middle East, besides some signs of hope in the dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, unfortunately, nothing positive comes from Iraq, torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees.\"\n\nPope Benedict XVI, in his first Easter message on April 16, 2006, called for a peaceful solution in the nuclear standoff with Iran, saying, \"Concerning the international crises linked to nuclear power, may an honorable solution be found for all parties through serious and honest negotiations.\" Tony Blair was granted a private audience with the Pope in June at the Vatican at the end of a week-long trip to Italy. The Pope told the Prime Minister to pursue diplomatic solutions to problems with states in the Middle East, including Iran. A Vatican spokesman said: \"The Pope did stress that diplomacy and not conflict was the best way forward\". The two leaders also discussed how \"moderate voices\" from the world's main religions need to work together to tackle extremism and reduce the risk of terrorism.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the Middle East and Iran with Pope Benedict in a private audience in August 2006. She came out of her hour-long audience saying it was a “very impressive” experience. “We had a very intense exchange on world politics, especially on the Middle East, but also on how the international community should deal with Iran\". Pope Benedict has been contacted by Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Tehran faces international isolation for its nuclear program.\n\nThe following month Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed respect for Pope Benedict XVI and said the pontiff had \"modified\" his remarks that offended Muslims worldwide.\"We respect the Pope and all those interested in peace and justice\", Ahmadinejad told a news conference before departing for Venezuela. \"I understand that he has modified the remarks he made.\"\n\nThe Pope met Iran's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki in December and called for dialogue to overcome conflicts, in an apparent reference to Tehran's standoff with the West over its atomic programme. The Vatican said in a statement that the Pope exchanged \"warm wishes\" with Mottaki.\"The problems of people are always resolved through dialogue, mutual comprehension and in peace,\" the Vatican said. Mottaki, during a private audience with the leader of the world's 1,000 million Roman Catholics, delivered a letter to the Pope from Ahmadinejad. \"The message is completely non-political\", Ehsan Jahandideh, a presidential office spokesman was quoted as saying by Iran's ISNA students news agency.\"The president has emphasised in the message that cooperation of divine religions will help resolving problems of mankind\", it said.\n\nOn May 4, 2007, former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami met Pope Benedict and said the wounds between Christians and Muslims were still \"very deep\", including those caused by a controversial papal speech last September. Khatami became one of the most prominent Muslim clerics to visit the Vatican since the Pope's controversial Regensburg speech which angered Muslims by appearing to link Islam and violence.The Vatican said Khatami and the Pope met for about 30 minutes and spoke through interpreters about the \"dialogue among cultures\" to overcome current tensions and promote peace. In talks that a spokesman called cordial, they also discussed the problems of minority Christians in Iran and the Middle East and encouraged peace efforts such as the conference on Iraq's future taking place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. In December Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent a Christmas message to the Pope saying that he hoped the Christian feast would \"bring peace and tranquility, founded upon justice and spirituality, to the international community.\" He told the Pontiff that he hoped the new year 2008 would bring \"the elimination of oppression, of violence, and of discrimination.\"\n\nThe Pope called for the establishment of a Palestinian state. He said: \"May the international community, which re-affirms Israel's just right to exist in peace, assist the Palestinian people to overcome the precarious conditions in which they live and to build their future, moving towards the constitution of a state that is truly their own\".\n\nThe Pope received the first Bethlehem Passport from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the Vatican on December 3, 2005. The citation reads:\n\n\"In that the bearer of this passport is a citizen of Bethlehem; that they recognise this ancient city provides a light to the world, and to all people who uphold the values of a just and open society; that they will remain a true friend to Bethlehem through its imprisonment, and that they will strive to keep the ideals of Bethlehem alive as long as the wall stands; we ask you to respect the bearer of the passport and to let them pass freely.\"\n\nThe passport is an initiative of the Open Bethlehem foundation, which was founded in November 2005 with the support of Bethlehem civil institutions and world figures including former USA President Jimmy Carter and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nOn June 14, 2006, Pope Benedict XVI urged Israelis and Palestinians in his weekly general audience to return to negotiation after the \"increasingly blind\" tit-for-tat violence. The Vatican said in a statement that the pope felt close to the innocent victims of such violence and that the Holy Land had become \"hostage to those who delude themselves they can solve the ever more dramatic problems of the region by force or unilateral action\". The Vatican appealed to both sides \"to show due respect for human life, especially that of unarmed civilians and children\". In its statement, the Vatican urged the resumption \"with courage of the path of negotiations, the only one that can lead to the just and lasting peace we all aspire to.\" It also urged the international community to \"rapidly activate\" funds for humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Later that month the Pope called for 'serene and peaceful co-existence' in the Middle East. Referring to Eastern Catholic Churches in the Holy Land, the Pope said\n\n\"the serious difficulties it is going through because of profound insecurity, lack of work, innumerable restrictions and consequent growing poverty, are a cause of pain for us all... I invite pastors, faithful, and everyone in positions of responsibility in the civil community, to favour mutual respect between cultures and religions, and to create as soon as possible the conditions for serene and peaceful coexistence throughout the Middle East.\"\nOn July 14, 2006, The Vatican condemned Israel's strikes on Lebanon, saying they were \"an attack\" on a sovereign nation. Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano said Pope Benedict and his aides were very worried that the developments in the Middle East risked degenerating into \"a conflict with international repercussions.\" \"In particular, the Holy See deplores right now the attack on Lebanon, a free and sovereign nation, and assures its closeness to these people who already have suffered so much to defend their independence\", he told Vatican Radio.\n\nTwo days later the Pope prayed that God grant “the fundamental gift of harmony, bringing political leaders back on the path of reason and opening new possibilities for dialogue and understanding.” “In these days, the news from the Holy Land are all cause for new, grave worry, in particular, the widening of belligerent actions even in Lebanon, and for the numerous victims among the civilian population. At the origin of these merciless conflicts are, unfortunately, objective situations of violation of rights and of justice. But neither terrorist acts nor retaliation, above all when there are tragic consequences for the civilian population, can be justified, going down such roads – bitter experience has shown – does not bring positive results.\" Later that month, Pope Benedict stated that he did not plan to intervene diplomatically in the Middle East fighting, but called on people of all religions to join Sunday's worldwide day of prayers for peace. \"I think it is best to leave that to the diplomats, because we don't enter politics. But we do everything for peace. Our goal is simply peace, and we will do everything to help attain peace,\" Benedict told reporters as he returned from an hour-long hike in the Italian Alps. The Pope has set aside Sunday as a worldwide day of prayers for peace, hoping the prayers will bring a halt to the fighting. Benedict invited everyone to pray, \"especially Muslims and Jews.\" Benedict said he had heard from Catholic communities in Lebanon and Israel, \"...especially from Lebanon, who implored us, as they have implored the Italian government, to help. We will help with our prayers and with the people we have in ... in Lebanon\".\n\nPope Benedict XVI appealed on July 30, 2006 for an immediate cease-fire in the Middle East, hours after the deadliest attack in nearly three weeks of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. \"In the name of God, I appeal to all those responsible for this spiral of violence, so that they immediately put down their arms on all sides. Immediately. I appeal to governing leaders and to international institutions not to spare any effort to obtain this necessary cessation of hostilities. In this moment I cannot help but think of the situation, ever more grave and more tragic, that the Middle East is going through: hundreds of dead, so many wounded, a huge number of the homeless and refugees, houses, cities and infrastructure destroyed. These facts demonstrate clearly that you cannot re-establish justice, create a new order and build authentic peace when you resort to instruments of violence\".\n\nWith the war in Lebanon, the Vatican's Middle East policies under Pope Benedict XVI came into clearer focus. Pope Benedict's pleas to stop the carnage, particularly after an Israeli air raid killed many civilians in Qana, echoed the dramatic appeals of Pope John Paul during times of Mideast conflict. In private talks, Vatican officials asked that the U.S. government use its influence with Israel to bring an immediate halt to hostilities. To the Israelis, the Vatican made it clear that it views its military offensive in Lebanon as a disproportionate use of force. On August 7, 2006, Pope Benedict XVI renewed his appeal for peace in the Middle East and said he was deeply disappointed that calls for an immediate cease-fire in Lebanon had been ignored. \"Faced with the bitter fact that up to now the calls for an immediate cease-fire in that martyred region have been disregarded, I feel impelled to renew my pressing appeal to that effect, asking everyone to offer their real contribution to the construction of a just and lasting peace.\" Pope Benedict donated two ambulances and emergency medical supplies to Caritas in Lebanon. \n\n\"War is the worst solution for everyone,\" he has said. \"It brings nothing of good for anyone, not even for the apparent victors. We know this well in Europe, after the two world wars. What everyone needs is peace. There are moral forces ready to help people understand that the only solution is that we must live together\". He said the Vatican's actions and his own appeals were designed to mobilize all the potential forces of peace.\n\nPope Benedict sent a special envoy to Lebanon to lead prayers for peace. The Pope has asked Roger Etchegaray, a French Cardinal who was often the late Pope John Paul's special envoy to trouble spots, \"to transmit to the suffering population ... his spiritual proximity and real solidarity\". While the French cardinal's mission is \"essentially religious\" to try to celebrate Mass on Sunday with the patriarch of Lebanon's Maronite church, the Vatican says he may also meet President Émile Lahoud and Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. Etchegaray, 83-year-old president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, was sent by Pope John Paul to Iraq in early 2003 to meet Saddam Hussein and try to avert war.\n\nThe Pope encouraged Syria to use its influence to help resolve Middle East conflicts and counter terrorism. He told Syria's ambassador that he was heartened by the diplomat's assurances that Damascus is committed to \"counter this growing threat to peace and stability. The world looks especially to countries with significant influence in the Middle East in the hopeful expectation of signs of progress toward the resolution of these long-standing conflicts\", the Pope said. A U.N. General Assembly resolution in September demanded that Israel withdraw from the Golan Heights, which it annexed from Syria in 1967. \"You have spoken of your government's concern over the annexation of the Golan Heights by Israel in 1967,\" Benedict said, referring to a speech that was just delivered by the ambassador, Makram Obeid, as the envoy presented his credentials\". Like many impartial observers, the Holy See believes that solutions are possible within the framework of international law through the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions,\" the pontiff said.\n\nThe Pope met Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas in April 2007 for talks that focused on the situation in the Middle East, the Vatican said in a statement. \"In particular an appreciation was expressed for the relaunch, also thanks to the efforts of the international community, of the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians,\" the statement said. Benedict also discussed the \"difficulty faced by Catholics\" in the Palestinian territories and \"the value of their contribution to that society,\" it added.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, while lecturing on \"Faith, Reason and the University\" at the University of Regensburg, where he was formerly a professor, Pope Benedict quoted the opinion of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, \"Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached\". In the original German, Benedict XVI described this critical opinion of Manuel II as \"addressed... with a startling brusqueness\" (\"\"in erstaunlich schroffer, uns überraschend schroffer Form\"\" ).\nThe Pope later explained that the remark was meant to compare early Muslim teaching on religious freedom with the later teaching on jihad, and was cited as part of a larger theological assertion, that \"reason and faith go hand in hand, and that the concept of a holy war is always unreasonable, and against the nature of God, Muslim or Christian\" \n\nThe quotation from this medieval text drew criticism from a number of individual governmental representatives and Muslim religious leaders, including Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, Hamza Yusuf, and Ali Bardakoğlu, the Director of Religious Affairs of Turkey, as well as the governments of Somalia and Pakistan and India's major political parties. Some critics claimed the Pope made a number of historical errors. The main one being that, although the Pope had said that verse 2:256 stating \"There is no compulsion in religion...\" was an early verse when Mohamed was powerless in Mecca, this verse was one of the latest verses to be added to the Quran in Medina at a time when the Muslim state was powerful thereby taking a lot of weight out of the Pope's statement. Others have noted a heavy reliance on \"analogia entis\" rather than \"analogia fidei\", and to consider \"faith as the common ground\" in the approach to Islam.\n\nThe Director of the Vatican press office, Federico Lombardi, explained the Pope's statement: \"It was certainly not the intention of the Holy Father to undertake a comprehensive study of the jihad and of Muslim ideas on the subject, still less to offend the sensibilities of Muslim faithful. Quite the contrary, what emerges clearly from the Holy Father’s discourses is a warning, addressed to Western culture, to avoid 'the contempt for God and the cynicism that considers mockery of the sacred to be an exercise of freedom'\".\n\nThere were public protests, including violent ones in the West Bank where two churches were firebombed, over his comments in various countries in the subsequent days. There has been a death threat on the Pope since the lecture from a group linked to Al Qaeda. \nPope Benedict expressed his regret for any offense his words had given: \"The Holy Father is very sorry that some passages of his speech may have sounded offensive to the sensibilities of Muslim believers,\" said Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone in a statement. According to CNN, the Vatican comments fell short of a literal apology. \n\nOn September 17, 2006, from the balcony at his residence at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome, Pope Benedict publicly expressed that he was 'deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries' and stressed that the words which 'were considered offensive' were not his own, but were quoted from a medieval text, and that his speech was intended to act as an invitation to mutually respectful dialogue with Muslims, rather than an attempt to cause offense. A few days later the Pope held a meeting at his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo with approximately 20 Muslim diplomats. At this meeting the Pope Benedict expressed \"total and profound respect for all Muslims\". Among the ambassadors invited included Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Morocco, and many other nations and Islamic Groups.\n\nThe following month Pope Benedict XVI took another step to placate anger in the Islamic world over his remarks on holy war, making additions to his original text affirming that a quotation from a 14th-century Byzantine emperor was not his personal opinion.The original said the emperor's remark was made \"\"somewhat brusquely\"\". In the new version, it says it was made with \"\"a brusqueness that we find unacceptable.\"\" Benedict added in a footnote: \"\"In the Muslim world, this quotation has unfortunately been taken as an expression of my personal position, thus arousing understandable indignation. I hope that the reader of my text can see immediately that this sentence does not express my personal view of the Quran, for which I have the respect due to the holy book of a great religion.\"\" He said he cited the text as part of an examination of the \"\"relationship between faith and reason\"\".\n\nAn open letter was sent to Pope Benedict XVI by 38 Muslim authorities (later extended to 100) express an acceptance for his apology over his remarks on Islam. The signatories to the letter declare that they accept the Pope's \"personal expression of sorrow and assurance that the controversial quote did not reflect his personal opinion\". Some of the clerics who signed the letter were Shaikh Habib Ali of the Tabah Institute in Abu Dhabi and Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, the special adviser to Jordan's King Abdullah II. Others who signed the letter include the grand muftis of Egypt, Russia, Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo and Metohija (Serbia), Turkey, Uzbekistan and Oman, as well as the Iranian Shiite cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Taskhiri, and Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr of George Washington University, Washington.\n\nPope Benedict XVI said his forthcoming visit to Turkey in 2006 was a sign of the friendship he held for the Turkish people. “As you all know I am leaving for Turkey on Tuesday,” the Pontiff said in his weekly Angelus prayer in Rome on the preceding Sunday. “Starting right now, I want to send a cordial greeting to the dear Turkish people, rich in history and culture. To these people and their representatives I express feelings of esteem and sincere friendship.” The Pope said he backed Turkey's bid to join the European Union, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said after meeting the pontiff upon his arrival in Ankara for his first visit to a Muslim country. The Pope told Erdoğan that while the Vatican seeks to stay out of politics it \"desires Turkey's membership in the EU\".\n\nThe Pope had reversed his earlier opposition to Turkey's efforts to join the EU, appearing to back the overwhelmingly Muslim country's hard-fought push towards membership at the start of his visit. The Pope expressed hope that Turkey would join the EU. A papal spokesman later clarified the remarks, saying the Pope had told the Turkish leader the Vatican did not have the power to intervene, but \"viewed positively and encouraged\" the process of Turkey's entry into the EU \"on the basis of common values and principles\". Mr Erdoğan said: “The most important message the Pope gave was toward Islam, reiterating his view of Islam as peaceful and affectionate.”\n\nPope Benedict XVI visited one of Turkey's most famous mosques in what was seen as an attempt to mend relations with the Muslim community. During his tour of the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, accompanied by local art historian Dr. Sedat Bornovalı, the pontiff turned towards Mecca in a gesture of Muslim prayer, together with Prof. Dr. Mustafa Çağrıcı, Mufti of İstanbul. It marked only the second papal visit in history to a Muslim place of worship. Earlier, the Pope visited the nearby Hagia Sophia Museum - a site heavy with Christian and Muslim symbolism - drawing a large crowd of protesters.\n\nThe Papal trip to Turkey was widely hailed as a success. The aim was to mend fences there and, as he was greeted on his return by Italian leader Romano Prodi, the pontiff appeared to have succeeded in this. Ilter Turan, a professor of political science in Istanbul, said: “Visiting the Blue Mosque and praying with the Muslims indicated that maybe he had not expressed himself carefully in his earlier conversations with students at Regensburg and certainly his gestures will go a long way to alleviate the initial scar that was left by his remarks”. The Pope also praised Islam as a peaceful faith and expressed support for Turkey's bid to join the EU.\n\nThe prayer in Istanbul’s Blue Mosque was “not initially planned but it turned out to be very meaningful”. It was a prayer to the “one Lord of heaven and earth, merciful father of all mankind”. Addressing today’s general audience, this was how Benedict XVI described his silent prayer on 30 November in Istanbul. The Pope “thanked divine Providence for this” and said: “May all believers identify themselves with the one God and bear witness to true brotherhood.” The Pontiff augured that Turkey “will be a bridge of friendship and collaboration between East and West” and he thanked the Turkish people “for the cordiality and sympathy” they showed him throughout his stay, when “he felt loved and understood”.\n\nThe Vatican considered Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's strong victory in the 2007 general election in Turkey \"the best result for Europe and for the Christian churches.\" In an interview published by Italian daily \"Corriere della Sera\", Cardinal Sergio Sebastiani also invited the European Union to resume talks with Ankara on Turkey's entry to the bloc.\n\nPope Benedict XVI called for negotiations to end fighting in Somalia, Associated Press reported from the Vatican City. In a speech to diplomats recently on global issues, the Pontiff recalled an Italian nun who was slain in Somalia last September, who he said would inspire efforts to end conflict in the Horn of Africa, where an Islamist movement threatening to overthrow the Western-backed dictatorship of Somalia has been ousted. Benedict called on all sides to lay down their arms and negotiate.\n\nPope Benedict XVI, meeting with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on 14 September 2007, voiced his \"heartfelt hope\" for the success of peace talks next month for the war-torn region of Darfur, the Vatican said. \"It is the Holy See's heartfelt hope that these negotiations prove successful in order to put an end to the suffering and insecurity of those peoples,\" the Vatican said in a statement.\n\nPope Benedict XVI welcomed King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to the Vatican on November 6, 2007, marking the first time that a Saudi king has officially held talks with the Pope. During their encounter, the two leaders discussed religious freedom, inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue and the need to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Pope received King Abdullah warmly, grasping both his hands and leading him into his library where they spoke in Italian and Arabic for 30 minutes. The meeting was arranged for at the request of the king who was on a tour of Europe.\n\n", "id": "7712543", "categories": ["Pope Benedict XVI"], "title": "Pope Benedict XVI and Islam"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712563", "text": "Francesc Palóu\n\nFrancesc Palóu or Francisco Palóu (1723–1789) was a Spanish Franciscan missionary, administrator and historian on the Baja California Peninsula and in Alta California. Palóu made significant contributions to the Alta California and Baja California mission systems. Along with his mentor, Junípero Serra, Palóu worked to build numerous missions throughout Alta and Baja California, many structures of which still stand today. A member of the Franciscan Order, Palóu became \"Presidente\" of the missions in Baja California, and later of missions of Alta California. Palóu's work in the Spanish mission system spans from his early twenties to his death at the age of 66.\nAccording to biographer Herbert E. Bolton, \"Fray Palóu was a diligent student, devout Christian, loyal disciple, tireless traveler, zealous missionary, firm defender of the faith, resourceful pioneer, successful mission builder, able administrator, and fair minded historian of California\". Palóu is particularly noted for his pious biography of Serra and for his multi-volume early history of the Californias.\n\nFrancisco (born Francesc) Palóu was born in Palma, Majorca, Spain, where he joined the Franciscan Order. Together with Junípero Serra, he traveled to New Spain in 1740 and served as a missionary in the Sierra Gorda region of Querétaro. When the Jesuits were expelled from Baja California in 1768, the Franciscans under Serra were sent to replace them. Palóu was assigned to the mission of San Javier. The following year, Serra went north to find the new mission province of Alta California, and Palóu succeeded him as head of the Baja California missions. When the Dominicans took over the peninsular Baja California missions in 1773, Palóu, being Franciscan, moved on to Upper California, marking the geographical boundary between the two orders' fields. He assisted in the exploration of the site of San Francisco and administered Mission San Francisco de Asís. When Serra died, Palóu was briefly acting head of the Baja California missions, but soon returned to central Mexico.\n\nAs a missionary of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, Palóu traveled and proselytized in the Spanish colonial empire. His extensive travels left him knowledgeable of world matters, and well-respected as a scholar. Coming from simple beginnings, Palóu was born in 1723 at Palma, on the Island of Majorca, and began religious work early in his life as he entered the Franciscan Order around the age of seventeen in 1739. After developing a mentor/student relationship with Junípero Serra, they both eagerly joined the Spanish mission system in Alta California. They, along with several other missionaries, reached Veracruz, New Spain in 1749. Palóu worked in New Spain for many in missions such as Sierra Gorda. He was later recalled, along with Serra, to work in the San Saba region of Texas. However, the biggest part of Palóu's journey would not begin until 1767, when he and fourteen other Franciscan friars were sent north to extend their efforts and replace many of the Jesuit missionaries who had been previously expelled from Spain. Much of Palóu's life would be spent in Alta California, and many of his notable endeavors occurred there as well.\n\nPalóu and the other friars reached Loreto in Lower California in the spring of 1768. Palou was given control of Mission San Francisco Javier. The following year, Junipero Serra left for Alta California to proceed with the further establishment of missions in that region. This left the office of \"president\" or superior of all missions in Lower California for Palóu to control until 1773. When the Lower Californian missions were turned over to the Dominican missionaries, Palóu was able to rejoin his brethren and mentor in Upper California. He first went to San Diego, then continued onwards to Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo (in present-day Carmel), which Serra had been using as his headquarters. Palóu greatly assisted in the placement of friars and recorded historical data, the only surviving account of some aspects of the early California missions.\n\nIn 1774, Palóu accompanied Captain Rivera's expedition to the Bay of San Francisco, and on December 4 planted the cross on a hill he named \"Lobos\" (wolves), which sits in clear view of the Golden Gate and Pacific Ocean. The name lives on as Lobos Creek, within the Presidio of San Francisco.\n\nThe Rivera expedition returned to the Presidio of Monterey via the coastal route first explored by the Portolà expedition of 1769. At the north end of Monterey Bay, Rivera and Palóu inspected the area around today's Santa Cruz, described by friar Juan Crespí (who accompanied Portolà) and recommended by Crespí as a future mission site. Palóu agreed, and on December 9 selected a location where Mission Santa Cruz was later founded by Fermín Lasuén, in 1791.\n\nPalóu returned to Lobos in 1776 with the De Anza expedition and, on June 28, offered up the first mass at the future site of Mission Dolores, which Palóu founded but a few weeks later. Palóu remained at the new mission until he was called to give his mentor and close friend, Junípero Serra, his last rites in 1784 at Mission San Carlos.\n\nWith Serra's death, Palóu became the acting \"presidente\" of the Upper California missions until the formal appointment of Lasuén as successor to Serra. Palóu remained at Mission San Carlos until failing health and old age led him to retire in 1785 to the missionary College of San Fernando de Mexico. He was elected guardian of the college and held this office until his death in Mexico, where he had completed his biography of Serra, most of which he had written while still in California.\n\nFrancisco Palóu played many key roles and offices vital to the establishment of several of the missions in California and many of those in Mexico. He compiled a standard history of the California missions from 1767 to 1784 in his \"\"noticias\"\" as a four-volume set. He also wrote of his teacher, Junípero Serra. Both works provide key information about early California and the missionary system established there.\n\n\n", "id": "7712563", "categories": ["1723 births", "Religious workers from California", "History of Baja California", "Roman Catholic missionaries in the United States", "1789 deaths", "People of Alta California", "Roman Catholic missionaries in New Spain", "18th-century Spanish people", "Spanish Roman Catholic missionaries", "Spanish Franciscans", "Priests of the Spanish missions in California", "People from Palma, Majorca", "Roman Catholic missionaries in Mexico"], "title": "Francesc Palóu"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712583", "text": "Asma bint Shihab\n\nAsma Bint Shihab al-Sulayhiyya (died 1087) was the queen and co-ruler of Yemen in co-regency with her cousin and spouse, Ali al-Sulayhi, and later her son Ahmad al-Mukkaram, and daughter-in-law, Arwa al-Sulayhi, from 1047 until 1087. Her full title as sovereign, \"al-Sayyida al-Hurrat-ul\" translates to \"The noble lady who is free and independent, the woman sovereign who bows to no superior authority\". As female sovereign, Asma bint Shihab has an almost unique position in history: though there were more female monarchs in the international Muslim world, Asma bint Shihab and Arwa al-Sulayhi were the only female monarchs in the Muslim Arab world to have had the \"khutba\" proclaimed in their name in the mosques as sovereigns.\n\nAsma bint Shihab married her cousin, Ali al-Sulayhi, sultan and founder of the Sulayhid dynasty. The marriage between Ali and Asma was reportedly a happy one, and Ali relied on her support on his way to power and participated in the sacrifices his religious faith placed upon him.\n\nWhen Ali became king in 1047, he named her queen, \"malika\", but not merely his consort, but his formally acknowledged co-ruler and political partner, who governed the realm of Yemen by his side. In recognition of this, her name was proclaimed alongside that of her spouse in the \"Khutba\", the traditional privilege of a sovereign in a Muslim state: 'the khutba was proclaimed from the pulpits of the mosques of Yemen in her husband's name and in her name', after the Fatimid sovereign and her husband: 'May Allah prolong the days of al-Hurra the perfect, who manages the affairs of the faithful with care.' This was the first time ever in history when the name of a woman had been proclaimed in the khutba. Another almost unique occurrence was that queen Asma bint Shihab \"attended councils with her face uncovered\", that is to say unveiled.\n\nMuhammad al-Thawr described her: \"She was one of the most famous women of her time and one of the most powerful. She was munificent. She was a poetess who composed verses. Among the praises given her husband al-Sulayhi by the poets was the fact that he had her for a wife ... . When he ascertained the perfection of her character, her husband entrusted the management of state business to her. He rarely made decisions that went against her advice and [...] regarded her with very great respect and never gave any other opinion precedence over hers.\"\n\nIn 1067, during the pilgrimage to Mecca, the Banu Najah clan under Sa'id Ibn Najah, the prince of Zabid, attacked the travel party of Ali and Asma, killed Ali and took Asma prisoner. She was sequestered in a secret prison in Zabid, and reportedly, the severed head of her spouse was planted on a pole visible from her cell. After a year's imprisonment, she managed to get a message through to her son and daughter-in-law in Sa'na, and her son stormed Zabid and freed her.\n\nAsma returned to her realm and assisted her son, Ahmad al-Mukkaram, and daughter-in-law, Arwa al-Sulayhi, with the management of the realm until she died. When she met her son al-Mukarram, she confirmed him as his father's successor, but when he was paralyzed shortly afterward, she retook control as the co-regent of the realm together with her daughter-in-law Arwa, who was to be her co-ruler in accordance with the will of her son, as he was himself unable to rule because of his condition.\n\nQueen Asma was sometime affectionally referred to as the Little Queen of Sheba, according to Muhammad al-Thawr, \"Some poets, carried away by their admiration of Asma, went so far as to declaim that if the throne of the queen of Sheba had been magnificent, that of Asma was still more so.\" This is somewhat remarkable, as the queen of Sheba belonged to the jahiliyya, the time before Islam, which was traditionally viewed as a negative one. Another name used both for her and her daughter-in-law and co-regent was \"malika hazima\": \"malika\" means queen, and \"hazim\" was an epithet awarded people regarded to have shown the utmost wisdom and judgement in political affairs.\n\n", "id": "7712583", "categories": ["Sulayhid dynasty", "Year of birth unknown", "1087 deaths", "Yemeni Ismailis", "Musta'li", "Rulers of Yemen", "Arab queens"], "title": "Asma bint Shihab"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712588", "text": "Leon Gilbert\n\nLeon Aaron Gilbert, Jr. (November 9, 1920 – March 28, 1999), of York, Pennsylvania was a decorated World War II combat veteran and a lieutenant in the all-black 24th U. S. Infantry Regiment that fought in the Korean War. His court-martial for refusing to obey an order from the regiment's white commanding officer led to worldwide protests and increased attention to segregation and racism in the U.S. military.\n\nBy the early 1950s, various Executive Orders had been issued attempting to end segregation in the U.S. armed forces. They had been largely ineffectual. The 24th Infantry Regiment, which consisted entirely of black soldiers, was thrown into the forefront of the Korean fighting at the outset.\n\nCasualties in the 24th were extremely heavy, and replacements and supplies, including shoes, were slow in coming. Stories began to filter out through various black news sources of atrocities committed by white American officers against the black troops they were leading. At one point the U.S. Air Force bombed the 24th by mistake, resulting in serious casualties.\n\nOn August 6, 1951, Colonel Arthur S. Champeny, a white man, was appointed the 24th's commanding officer and informed them he was going to change their reputation from \"the frightened 24th to the fighting 24th.\"\n\nLeon Aaron Gilbert, Jr. was born in York, Pennsylvania on November 9, 1920, the eldest of two sons of a blacksmith who had also served in World War I. He was educated in local schools and enlisted in the U. S. Army at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on August 16, 1940. He served with the 92d Division in Italy and was honorably discharged in 1946, then called up again as a reservist in 1947. He was thus a decorated veteran with a record of ten years' service in the Army. He and his wife Kay had two children with a third on the way.\n\nIn the fall of 1950, Gilbert was in command of Company A of the 24th, having taken over when his commanding officer was wounded. He received an order to return with twelve of his men to a forward position. Gilbert's company had been forced to withdraw from that position after coming under heavy machine gun fire at close to point blank range, so to return to that position would have been tantamount to suicide. When Gilbert refused the order to return, he was arrested and tried on the spot. Despite Gilbert's suffering from shock and fatigue due to prolonged heavy fighting (according to a letter to his wife, they had gone thirteen days without food or water), he was accused of insubordination and cowardice, and a court martial sentenced him to death. In an interview with the \"New York Times\", Gilbert gave his version of the incident.\n\nI did not refuse to obey the order. I was trying to explain why it couldn't be carried out. There were twelve men in my command. Then I considered it my duty as an officer to show why the order meant certain death.\n\nA storm of public protest erupted around the world in reaction to the sentencing; in the U.S., labor leaders, church leaders, and the American Legion became involved, and the National Negro Council collected 600,000 signatures on a petition for his pardon. President Harry S. Truman commuted the sentence to 20 years' imprisonment at hard labor, dishonorable discharge, and forfeiture of all pay and pension allowances.\n\nIn September 1952 the sentence was reduced to seventeen years for \"battle misconduct.\" Gilbert served five years, the maximum penalty for disobedience under peacetime conditions (war was never officially declared in Korea), before he was released.\n\nFollowing the court-martialing of Lieutenant Gilbert, mass court-martialing of whole units of the 24th Regiment ensued, with no comparable action being taken against white units.\n\nThurgood Marshall, general counsel of the NAACP, wrote \"The letters we have received from convicted soldiers and the talks we have had with war correspondents strongly indicate that many of these men have been victimized by racial discrimination... It seems apparent that some of them are being made scapegoats for the failures of higher personnel.\"\n\nIn 1996, an official Army report noted that Gilbert's regiment performed poorly in the early years of the Korean War, as did many white units, but went on to say, \"There was no single reason for what happened (to the 24th)...An aggressive enemy, old and worn equipment, inexperience at all levels, leadership failures high and low, casualties among key personnel and a lack of bonding and cohesion in some units all played their part. There was no lack of courage among the officers and men.\"\n\nThe incident scarred Gilbert for life. His father had died while he was in custody, and five years after he was released on parole, his wife divorced him. Gilbert returned to his hometown of York, Pennsylvania, remarried, and lived quietly until his death. Although he never stopped trying to clear his name, to little avail, his last years were cheered somewhat by the fact that his surviving comrades-in-arms had never forgotten him, and after they had located him, welcomed him back into their ranks. As one of them reported, \"He didn't know if we would accept him. We welcomed him with open arms. No matter what was written, no matter what was said, we know the facts. We were there.\" \n\n", "id": "7712588", "categories": ["History of racial segregation in the United States", "1920 births", "People from York, Pennsylvania", "1999 deaths"], "title": "Leon Gilbert"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712632", "text": "Renix\n\nRenix (Renix Electronique) was a joint venture by Renault and Bendix that designed and manufactured automobile electronic ignitions, fuel injection systems, electronic automatic transmission controls, and various engine sensors. Major applications included various Renault and Volvo vehicles. The name became synonymous in the U.S. with the computer and fuel injection system used on the AMC/Jeep 2.5 L I4 and 4.0 L I6 engines.\n\nThe term Renix also has a number of applications. In certain carburetor equipped Renault and Volvo models, it provides an electronic ignition system, consisting of an engine control unit (ECU) to replace the job of contact breaker points in the distributor. The system uses an angle sensor and a number of fuel sensors to provide a maintenance-free ignition system. The ECU is sealed and cannot be serviced, and the EPROM cannot be re-programmed.\n\nLater, the name was synonymous with a form of fuel injection. In such an application, it consisted of an ECU and a number of sensors. It was first seen in engines produced by Renault (Renault 21, 25, and Espace) in and capacities. It is better known in America for its application in the AMC 4.0 L displacing straight-6 engines. Production began by American Motors (AMC) with the 1987 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) models. It was preceded by the AMC Computerized Engine Control, and followed by Chrysler's Mopar MPI system.\n\nRenix Electronique S.A., was established in 1981 as a joint venture by Renault with 51% interest and Bendix with 49% that was headquartered in Toulouse. Renix Corporation of America was the North American subsidiary of Renix Electronique to provide sales, logistics, engineering, and quality support to American Motors.\n\nWhen Renault encountered financial troubles in 1985, it sold its interest in Renix to AlliedSignal, a major auto industry supplier and the new owner of Bendix. Renix Corporation of America was also absorbed by AlliedSignal Corporation when it purchased Renix Electronique from Renault. The US$200 million Allied buyout of Renault's 51% of Renix made it part of Bendix Electronics and Engine Controls. Renix products will be produced in France and marketed worldwide under the Bendix brand name. In 1988, the French Bendix site is sold to Siemens VDO. In 2008, Siemens AG sells its VDO branch to Continental automotive group.\n\nThe Renix system was used in the J series engines as fitted to the Renault 19 16V, Renault 21 and Savanna/Nevada, the Renault 25, and the Renault Espace. It was a multi-point fuel injection system, as opposed to a single-point system, with a number of air, throttle and pinking sensors, and an advanced computer. Application of the system could first be seen in 1984, three years before its American debut. The Renix system pushed the power of the carburetor-fed engine from . It could also be found in 2.2 L engines fitted to R21, 25, and Espace models.\n\nThe Renix fuel injection and a Garrett turbocharger was used in the mid-mounted V6 powering the Renault Alpine GTA/A610 sports car.\n\nAMC-Renault uses a fully integrated electronic engine control system made by Renix\nThe Renix electronic ignition system consists of a solid-state Ignition Control Module (ICM), a distributor, a crankshaft position sensor, and an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The Renix ECU has a powerful microprocessor that was advanced technology for its time. It also incorporates an engine knocking sensor that allows the computer to know if detonation is occurring, thus allowing the computer to make adaptive control by individual cylinder corrections to prevent pinging. The knock detection uses the signal from a wide bank accelerometer mounted on the cylinder head. Good signal to noise ratio is obtained primarily through angular discrimination.\n\nThe Renix system has more inputs than the later Mopar system and in some ways is more complex. Its knock sensor automatically tunes the spark advance curve to an optimum mix for each cylinder. Some Renix controlled engines will actually get better fuel economy using higher octane fuel. The system on the AMC 4.0 L is flexible allowing the use of a larger camshaft and modifications to the cylinder heads without significant changes to the base computer.\n\nThe Renix computer was first used on 1986 AMC 2.5 L four-cylinder enginess. The system improved the drivability of the Jeep Cherokee and Comanche over carbureted models. The power increase was also noticeable. The Renix system was used through the 1990 model year. Unfortunately, it is handicapped because few scan tools can be \"plugged in\" to this on-board diagnostics computer. The Renix control system prior to 1991 can be tested only with Chrysler's DRB tester, and the diagnostic test modes for 1989 and later engines with SBEC controllers differ from those provided for 1988 and earlier models.\n\nThe Renix control system was only found on the 1987-1990 Jeep Cherokee and Comanche with AMC-designed engines (the control setup used with the V6 was OBD-I General Motors, and the early Diesel was a Renault turbodiesel I4 that used its own specific control setup.)\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler (YJ) did not get the AMC 4.0 engine until 1991, when it was accompanied by Chrysler-designed electronics as well. Until then, it retained the AMC engine with a carburetor. No other Jeep vehicle was equipped with Renix electronic controls.\n\nIn a typical Jeep application, the ignition control module (ICM) is located in engine compartment. It consists of a solid-state ignition circuit, as well as an integrated ignition coil that can be removed and serviced separately. Electronic signals from the ECU to the ICM determine the amount of ignition timing or retard needed to meet engine power requirements. The ECU provides an input signal to the ICM. The ICM has outputs for a tach signal to the tachometer and a high voltage signal from the coil to the distributor. The crankshaft position sensor senses TDC (Top Dead Center) and BDC crankshaft positions, as well as engine rpm. This sensor is secured by special shouldered bolts to flywheel/drive plate housing and is not adjustable.\n\nThe Renix control system is \"pre-OBD\" and therefore does \"not\" have a \"Check Engine Lamp\". It also does not \"store\" or \"throw\" Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) or \"Parameter IDs\" (PIDs). This is a common problem at vehicle inspection, particularly in California and other jurisdictions with emission standards. Most inspection stations are not aware and will try to explain the CEL/MIL \"doesn't work\".\n\nIn the 1980s, Skoda manufactured a small number of rear-engined cars with Renix fuel injection. These were originally destined for Canada but ended up in Europe. These are usually known as 135 GLi or 135 RiC. Fuel system parts may be available from Chrysler-Jeep dealers.\n\nThe Volvo 700 Series and some of the Volvo 300 Series used a B200K 2.0 L inline-4 naturally aspirated engine with Renix ignition and some 300 series Volvos with Renault powerplants. The 300 Volvo series is not known U.S. It was manufactured in the Netherlands (with a limited production of cars in Malaysia through CKD process).\n\nAll 300 series Volvo cars with gasoline engines came with Renix/Bendix ignition 1983 onwards until 1991 when production of the 300 series stopped.\nVolvo \"Redblock\" engines equipped with Renix ignition: \n\nRenault derived units with Renix ignition: \n\nB172K and B18 were based on the Renault FnN (n being 1, 2 or 3) engines from Renault, B14.x based on Renault C1J, both types were modified for Volvo to varying extent.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7712632", "categories": ["Engine control systems", "Renault", "American Motors", "Engine technology", "AMC engines", "Jeep engines"], "title": "Renix"}

It was a single-engine, low-wing (Folding), wood-and-fabric monoplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage.\n\nBuilt by Percival Aircraft of Gravesend and Luton (after 1936 when Percival Aircraft became a Limited Company), the 'K-Series' Vega Gull was a development of their earlier 'D-Series' Gull. The main changes from the earlier design were the provision of an additional fourth seat, dual controls and flaps. The fuselage was widened and the wingspan increased. Increases in drag were compensated for by reducing parasitic drag from exterior fittings such as hinges and actuation horns. This work was largely attributable to the arrival at Percivals of the talented aircraft designer Arthur Bage. Thus, the Vega Gull was very nearly as fast as the more svelte Gull Six. Payload, range and utility were all much improved. The prototype \"G-AEAB\" first flew from Gravesend in November 1935.\n\nThe Vega Gull retained the de Havilland Gipsy Six air-cooled inline engine introduced in the D.3 Gull Six of 1934. Most examples were fitted with the optional DH Gipsy Six Series II engine in conjunction with the DH-PD30 VP airscrew. The final Mk II examples were fitted with a curved windscreen (the earlier examples had a multi-faceted windscreen of flat panels) similar in appearance to the early marks of the Proctor.\n\nA Vega Gull named \"Messenger\" was used by Beryl Markham on her transatlantic flight 4–5 September 1936, the first solo east-to-west crossing by a woman.\n\nTwo early production Vega Gulls were entered into the Schlesinger Race from England to Johannesburg, South Africa. C.W.A. Scott and Giles Guthrie flying Vega Gull \"G-AEKE\" was the only finisher landing at Rand Airport on 1 October 1936. The aircraft had left Portsmouth 52 hours 56 minutes 48 seconds earlier. With the publicity of the win, Percival set up a production line at larger premises at Luton. The new type was an immediate success with production running to 90, the last production aircraft having its maiden flight on 27 July 1939.\n\nThe Vega Gull was widely used by British and Commonwealth aviators during the later years of the \"Golden Age\" of record-setting aviation during the 1930s. Alex Henshaw, Jim Mollison, Amy Johnson, Beryl Markham, C.W.A. Scott and others, won races and broke records to South Africa, South America, Australia and New Zealand, to name but a few.\n\nIn addition to civil orders, 15 were ordered by the Air Ministry. Of these, 11 served with 24 Squadron Royal Air Force on communications duties and two were issued to the Fleet Air Arm, which was yet to come under Admiralty control. The remaining two were used by the British air attachés in Buenos Aires and Lisbon. A third aircraft for use by the British air attaché in Berlin was seized by the Germans at the outbreak of the Second World War. It remains unclear whether the \"Luftwaffe\" subsequently used this machine.\n\nAfter the outbreak of war, Vega Gulls were requisitioned for military use. In the UK, 21 were impressed in 1939–40, 14 for the RAF and seven for the FAA. Two aircraft were impressed in each of Australia and India, while one other was \"called to the colours\" in New Zealand.\n\nBy the end of the war, the Vega Gull had been largely supplanted by its younger sibling, the Proctor, of which more than 1,100 were manufactured. Most Proctors, especially the later examples, were slower and more cumbersome than the original Vega. Despite the obvious drawbacks of its wooden airframe in terms of durability, the Vega Gull compares favourably with more modern designs. To save hangar space, the wings could be folded to reduce the space needed for storage.\n\n\nCivil Vega Gulls have been registered in the following countries; Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, India, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7712646", "categories": ["Hunting Percival aircraft", "1930s British civil utility aircraft", "Single-engined tractor aircraft", "Low-wing aircraft", "1930s British military utility aircraft"], "title": "Percival Vega Gull"}

He had previously served as president of the Wabash Railroad, and served as president of the N&W from October 1, 1963, until his retirement in April 1970.\n\n\"Commonwealth Magazine\" once described Pevler as \"a driver who operated with doors open and coats off,\" citing the \"sheer force of his personality\" and vigor in his activities. He was an alumnus of Purdue University. He was buried in Evergreen Burial Park, Roanoke, Virginia,\n\nIn 1927, Herman Pevler commenced work with the Pennsylvania Railroad, and he was elected Vice President of that railway in 1948.\n\nIn 1959, he was elected a director of the First National Bank at St. Louis.\n\nHerman Pevler was the president of Wabash Railroad before he succeeded Stuart T. Saunders as President of N&W. Saunders left to head the Pennsylvania Railroad, a major N&W stockholder at that time. Pevler oversaw consummation of a complex group of mergers begun under Saunders which brought into the N&W fold the Nickel Plate Road, the Wabash Railroad and portions of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The mergers were completed in 1964, and widely expanded the company, reaching such major points as Detroit, Chicago, and St. Louis. The latter two were major gateways and interchange points with western railroads.\n\nFollowing the expansion, NW revenues quadrupled during Pevler's administration. Coming from the Wabash, he was the first N&W president in the 20th century to have not come up through the lower ranks of the N&W, and his leadership was met with some resistance by some N&W staff. Among his legacies was a change in N&W livery on locomotives to a blue very similar to that employed by the Wabash, which became known within the company as \"Pevler blue.\" As his mandatory retirement age approached, it became known that Pevler intended to recommend to the Board of Directors a top official of another railroad as his replacement. However, quick maneuvering by N&W insiders and lobbying of key directors resulted in the selection of John P.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712696", "text": "Yale-China Association\n\nThe Yale-China Association (), formerly Yale-in-China, is an independent, nonprofit organization which seeks to develop educational programs in and about China and further understanding between Chinese and American people. Founded in 1901 and originally a Protestant missionary society, Yale-China's work is characterized by long-term relationships to build Chinese institutional capacity. Current programs include the fields of public health and nursing, legal education, English language instruction, American Studies, and cultural exchange for Chinese and American students. Publications include a regular newsletter, biennial report, and the annual Yale-China Health Journal.\n\nThe Yale-China Association was first incorporated as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society, and was known informally as Yale-in-China as early as 1913. It was nondenominational from its beginnings and by the 1920s had ceased to be an overtly missionary enterprise. It was re-incorporated in 1934 as a secular organization, the Yale-in-China Association, and in 1975 as the Yale–China Association.\n\nA reflection of the religious fervor sweeping American college campuses at the end of the 19th century, which took form in the Student Volunteer Movement, Yale-China was founded in 1901 as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society by a group of Yale graduates and faculty members committed to establishing a Christian missionary presence overseas. The founders chose China as the focus of their work, in part to honor the memory of a Yale graduate from the class of 1892, Horace Tracy Pitkin, who had worked in China as a missionary and was killed in 1900 during the Boxer Uprising. The city of Changsha in Hunan Province was chosen as the base of operations in China after consultation with other foreign missionaries.\n\nAt the urging of the home office in New Haven as well as other missionaries in China, the Yale Mission early on assumed more of an educational than evangelical function. With the arrival of Dr. Edward H. Hume in 1905, medical education and care became a major focus of the endeavor. The educational compound that began with Dr. Hume's medical clinic eventually grew to comprise a preparatory school, the Yali School; the College of Yale-in-China (later moved to Wuhan, where it joined two other missionary colleges to form Huachung University); and the Hsiang-Ya Medical College, Nursing School and Hospital. Over the years, Hsiang-Ya (a compound of hsiang, denoting Hunan, and ya, denoting Yale-China; transliterated today as Xiangya) developed a reputation for providing the most advanced training in Western medicine in all of central and southern China. More than at other foreign-affiliated institutions, an effort was made early on to bring as many Chinese faculty and administrators on board as possible. By the late 1920s, all major leadership positions were held by Chinese, and Yale-in-China was very much a joint Sino-American enterprise.\n\nBetween 1919 and 1920, future Chairman Mao Zedong had several encounters with the school: he edited its student magazine, re-focusing it on \"thought reorientation,\" and operated a bookshop out of its medical college.\n\nThe war years (1937–45) placed enormous strains on the Yale-in-China institutions, especially the Hsiang-Ya Hospital, which cared for war casualties and refugees. For example, the life of paralyzed Frank Wattendorf was spared at the hospital before he was evacuated.\n\nMany of the Changsha facilities were damaged by invading Japanese troops. Nevertheless, these challenges served to inspire renewed commitment on the part of both American and Chinese faculty and administrators. The Yale-in-China staff who returned to Changsha in September 1945 were determined to rebuild the campus and resume their pre-war operations. Within four years, however, a Communist insurgency toppled the Nationalist government and Yale-in-China's future seemed uncertain in the face of growing hostility between the United States and China.\n\nBy 1951, the new Communist government had taken possession of Yale-in-China's Changsha properties and renamed the Yali School as \"Liberation Middle School.\" Dr. Dwight Rugh, Yale-in-China's last representative in Changsha, spent most of 1950 under house arrest as the only American on campus, and was eventually expelled from China in May 1951. With his departure, the ties between Yale-in-China in New Haven and the institutions in Changsha and Wuhan were broken for nearly 30 years.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1954, hostility against the United States on the mainland and turmoil on Nationalist-held Taiwan led to a suspension of Yale-in-China's work within China. Preston Schoyer, who had been a Bachelor in Changsha before the war, worked both formally and informally to develop new programs and maintain ties with old friends. During those years, Yale-in-China devoted its resources to financing the education of Chinese students in the U.S. while looking in Asia for new projects to support. Attention soon focused on a refugee college in the British colony of Hong Kong which had been founded by Ch'ien Mu (1895–1990) and other Chinese intellectuals determined to preserve traditional Chinese learning and values in the face of the Communist victory on the mainland. In early 1954, after a visit to the colony and months of negotiations, Yale-in-China's trustees formally affiliated the organization with New Asia College.\n\nUnlike in Changsha, Yale-in-China's relationship with New Asia College was, by intention, one of support and assistance rather than direct administration. Yale-in-China secured funding from the Ford Foundation and other U.S. foundations to support the development of the college, and also provided fellowships for New Asia faculty to pursue further study in the United States. In 1956, Yale-in-China resumed the practice of sending Bachelors, two recent Yale graduates, to teach English, though now to New Asia College instead of the Yali School.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the possibility of founding a university in Hong Kong that would use Chinese as the language of instruction was explored. In 1959, the Council of British Universities selected New Asia, United and Chung Chi colleges to federate and form the new Chinese University of Hong Kong, which was formally inaugurated in 1963 on its Shatin campus. Preston Schoyer played a key role in negotiating New Asia's entrance. Yale-in-China contributed to the new campus by securing funds to construct buildings, including the university health clinic, the Yali Guest House, Friendship Lodge and a student dormitory at New Asia College. Yale-in-China also contributed to the early internationalization of the campus by helping to establish the New Asia - Yale-in-China Chinese Language Centre and the International Asian Studies Programme, which now enroll hundreds of international students every year. Meanwhile, the relationship with New Asia College, where the Yale–China Association (as the organization was renamed in 1975) has maintained a representative office for fifty years, remains a strong one.\n\nBy the 1970s, both New Asia College and the Chinese University of Hong Kong had achieved a level of institutional maturity and financial stability that decreased the need for Yale-China's contributions. At the same time, the normalization of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China presented the possibility of resumed activity on the mainland. In the fall of 1979, Yale-China staff traveled to Changsha to explore opportunities for academic exchange with administrators and faculty at Hunan Medical College, the successor to Hsiang-Ya, and several exchange agreements were concluded that led to the arrival of Yale-China English teachers in September 1980 and exchanges of medical personnel between Yale University and Hunan Medical College. Two English instructors were also sent to Wuhan University the same year and later to Huazhong Normal University.\n\nDespite the geographical continuities, however, the intervening years had brought substantial changes to Chinese higher education and within Yale-China itself. Political sensitivities in China and Yale-China's own evolution determined that any new activity in China would be of a nature substantially different from that of the pre-1949 years. Rather than seeking to resume the joint administration of the former Yale-in-China institutions, the emphasis was placed on shorter-term academic exchanges in the fields of medicine and American Studies and a resumption of the English language instruction program. Throughout the 1980s, Yale-China's medical program brought almost 50 Chinese medical personnel to the U.S. and sent over 40 Americans to China for exchanges of medical knowledge. During the same years, nearly 100 Yale graduates participated in Yale-China's English teaching program in China. Yale-China also continued to send English teachers to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and maintained its involvement with the university's International Asian Studies Program.\n\nThe decade of the 1990s brought an expansion of Yale-China's activities into new program areas and affiliations with institutions outside of Yale-China's historical bases in Hong Kong, Changsha and Wuhan. While maintaining its English teaching program, Yale-China initiated projects in environmental protection and pediatric cardiology and facilitated a drama collaboration between New Haven's Long Wharf Theater and the Shanghai People's Art Theater which resulted in a Chinese-language stage production of Amy Tan's \"Joy Luck Club\" in 1994. Other areas of expansion have included the fields of American Studies, legal education, public health, nursing, and service in the non-profit sector for China and American students.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7712696", "categories": ["Education in China", "Educational organizations based in the United States", "Yale University", "Christianity in China", "United States friendship associations"], "title": "Yale-China Association"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712700", "text": "Folsom Library\n\nThe Richard G. Folsom Library (\"Folsom Library\") is a research library in the Rensselaer Research Libraries system constructed in the Brutalist style located on the campus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY. It is named after Richard Gilman Folsom, the President of the Institute from 1958–1971. The Folsom Library offers a variety of services to students and patrons of the library. In addition to loans, these services include class reserves, general writing and presentation assistance through the Center for Communication Practices, cultural and educational events, inter-library loans through ConnectNY, individual and group room reservations, computer labs, and wireless internet.\n\nThe library has integrated many electronic resources into its offering, such as research databases and digital music libraries. The library is also one of 1250 federal depository libraries in the United States, and maintains an up-to-date archive of thousands of federal documents open to the public. Over 458,260,999 resources are available online or in the Folsom Library to faculty, staff, and researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute including over seven million books and eight million trade publications.\n\nThe origins of the modern Folsom Library can be traced to the founding of the school in 1824. It was created in line with the Constitution and Laws of Rensselaer, which stated that the school would have \"a very ample scientific library to which members of the institution will have free access\". At that time, the Rensselaer School occupied The Old Bank Place in Troy, and it is likely that the original library was only a single room or small part of a room. The earliest librarian was a student named Albert Danker from the first graduating class, and the collection consisted of a sparse number of scientific works.\n\nFor a short period of time, the library belonged to Amos Eaton, a local scientist and educator. He obtained rights to the Old Bank Place after the Rensselaer School changed its name to the Rensselaer Institute, and moved to the nearby Van Der Heyden Mansion. The school moved back to the Old Bank Place in the same year, and upon Eaton's death in 1842, regained ownership of the collection. The library stayed under the ownership of Rensselaer when the institute was forced to move (due to estate ownership complications) to the Infant School, a small brick building in downtown Troy.\n\nIn 1862, sparks from a passing locomotive on the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad bridge caused a massive fire that wiped out a large portion of Troy and the majority of Rensselaer's property. Relocation and reconstruction began on 8th Street in Troy, and in 1864, the library of 396 volumes moved into the Main Building, where it would stay for another 30 years. During that time, an 80-page catalog of the library's collection entitled \"Catalogue of the Library of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N.Y.\" was published, and it listed over 1000 titles spanning various technical areas. From 1893 to 1927, the library moved several times, finding home in the Alumni House on 2nd Street and later moving to the Pittsburgh Building and Amos Eaton Hall.\n\nDespite its growing collection, in its early years, the library was rarely used by students. During the years of 1912 and 1913, when the library was located in the Pittsburgh Building, there was considerably low utilization of the collection, with many students only visiting the building in their Senior year to prepare for their graduation theses. This was also partly due to the limited scope of the collection, which by Rensselaer's technical nature, consisted primarily of technical journals and other periodicals.\n\nStudent use increased during the period of 1912 to 1927 as the curriculum of the institute expanded and more volumes were added to the collection to supplement professors' instruction. It was also during this period of time that the library moved from the Pittsburgh Building to the more spacious Amos Eaton building. The Amos Eaton building offered sufficient space for a little over 30 years, until a growing number of publications written after World War II forced the collection to move again to the recently purchased St. Joseph Convent chapel.\n\nThe library's continued growth forced the institute to take into consideration creating a dedicated building for holding its collection. Up until 1950, the collection had been largely technical, but expansion of the Humanities and Social Sciences as well as increased research created an intense demand on the library. The library had constantly been moved from building to building up until this point, never having had an actual home dedicated strictly for library usage. To evaluate the possibility of a new location, a Library Advisory Committee was formed. The committee first published their discovery of numerous deficiencies in the current library in June 1962 in a report called \"Future of the RPI Library Collection\". The New York State Education Department also noted deficiencies of the library during their evaluation of the graduate program.\n\nOn June 20, 1967, the Library Advisory Committee published a report known as the \"Greene Report\", which detailed the purpose and requirements of a new library for the institute as well as previous research done about the library's efficacy. The report stated that \"The Library is the information center of the university, providing resources to the scholars who are making, doing, and thinking things\". It went on to detail the primary functions of the library to be education and research, and emphasized that the library must contain a strong collection in periodical literature, go beyond books (towards audio visual collections), strengthen peripheral material availability, and centralize all of the institutes's collections. The report also listed a number of other improvements, including:\n\n\nAt the time, it was also clear that Rensselaer was lacking in its collection when compared to its peers. In 1967, James E. Skipper, a researcher for the Association of Research Libraries, compiled a table illustrating the collections of various universities in New York.\n\nThe Greene Report made it clear that there was a need for a new library on campus, and the next phase of the process began, where the location of the library would be decided. The institute hired Quinlivan Pierik & Krause, an architecture firm centered in Syracuse, to evaluate the campus and determine a possible location for the new library. The firm recommended a location on the west side of campus, adjacent to the library's current location in the St. Joseph Convent chapel.\n\nOn October 23, 1970, the firm requested a meeting with the president at the time, Richard Folsom, to discuss the possibility of a staged construction procedure where the facility would be built in iterations. Each iteration would have an increasing amount of space. The initial iteration, with the existing chapel space, would offer a total collection storage space of . Projections by the architect indicated that a total of would be available in 1985, followed by in 2010. The firm believed that this method of construction would allow expansion at a rate that the institute budget could accommodate.\n\nPresident Folsom presented the idea of a phased construction to the Library Advisory Committee, who supported the idea but criticized it for its continued use of the chapel as well as placing the campus in a constant state of construction. The committee also suggested considering one of the earlier potential locations, close to the bleachers located on the '86 Field, an athletic field at the center of the campus. Professor Howard Litman, the chairman of the committee at the time, issued the statement \"In summary, the most recent proposal for providing new facilities for the Rensselaer library is a workable but undesirable plan of development. It will, for the short term, provide desperately needed space, but in the long run yield an unexpectedly costly facility in the wrong place.\" \n\nBeyond the concerns over \"how\" the library would be constructed, questions still remained over where it would be built. Dissent existed among the library committee over the location, with those opposed to the western development arguing that a central location would be more convenient for students. The architecture firm, which had supported the western location for development, issued a report emphasizing the benefits of building next to the chapel. In the report, listed several factors that made the site an optimal choice, including the fact that \"distant observability of a building on this site is excellent\".\n\nThe report convinced 10 out of the 12 members of the Library Advisory Committee to support the site recommendation. In 1971, the final decision was made to create a facility on the west side of campus. The new library would have an underground annex and a pedestrian plaza that would connect it to St. Joseph's Chapel (now the Voorhees Computing Center), and would cost approximately $6.9 million.\n\nWith the constant delay in construction, many students had adopted an attitude of disdain towards the library. As one student quoted in a report on the library, \"There existed an attitude of the Library being a very second class function on campus, expected to make do with inadequate housing and financial support and generally held in low self esteem.\" \n\nUnfortunately, there existed an additional delay one year after the decision was made on the location and size of the building. In 1972, James C. Andrews, the Director of Libraries at the Institute at the time, issued a report pointing out weaknesses in the recently reaffirmed proposal for construction. In the report, Andrews pointed out that the current location was far from the center of the campus and student dorms, was closed in on three sides by existing buildings, and that the size was not sufficient for the requirement decided by student and faculty surveying. Knowing that there wasn't much that could be changed about the location at this point in the development process, Andrews suggested several other improvements. The Library Journal, a magazine which discussed various designs for libraries around the country, contained an article by Andrews in which he suggested the following changes:\n\n\nThese improvements were taken into consideration in the ultimate design of the library, and construction began. \nThe building had its dedication ceremony on May 15, 1976. J. Erik Jonsson, an alumnus and trustee who had donated $2 million to get construction of the library started, decided to name the library after the president of the institute who had initiated construction - Richard Folsom.\n\nIn its discussion of the Folsom Library, The Library Journal also includes data on the Folsom Library:\n\nAfter the initial pouring of concrete for Folsom Library's floors, it was noticed that the concrete contracted significantly—to the point that more concrete had to be poured in order to make the floors level and be able to properly install book stacks. As a result, the floors are slightly bowed. According to college legend, the contractor designed the foundation without knowing that it was to be a library. A myth spread, that persists to this day, that Folsom Library is slowly sinking or slipping down the hill. RPI students refer to this phenomenon, which also applies to a few other buildings on campus, as \"sliding down the hill into Troy.\" However, the notion of libraries sinking into the ground is not confined to the RPI campus; other communities and colleges also report the same issues, even though it was debunked by snopes.com.\n\n, the Rensselaer Research Libraries contained 458,260,999 resources available online or in the library that include:\n\nThe design of the Folsom Library has remained fairly static since its initial conception in June 1972. The concrete exterior that is in place is designed to complement the light gray brick of the nearby St. Joseph's Chapel.\n\nIn 2005, the Folsom Library Renewal project was started. The redesign, a product of cooperation between an alumnus and Rensselaer's Design and Construction group, focused on creating a more welcoming space and improving the overall image of the building.\n\nChanges include:\n\n\n the hours of the Folsom Library, when classes are in session are:\n\n\nCurrent listing of hours can be found via a link on the Libraries' homepage at http://library.rpi.edu/.\n\n", "id": "7712700", "categories": ["Library buildings completed in 1976", "Buildings and structures in Troy, New York", "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute", "University and college academic libraries in the United States", "Federal depository libraries", "Brutalist architecture in New York (state)"], "title": "Folsom Library"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712713", "text": "Fire in the Hole (Silver Dollar City)\n\nFire in the Hole is a three-story steel enclosed roller coaster at Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri. The ride was built in-house by Silver Dollar City in 1972. The ride is often referred to as a cross between dark ride and roller coaster. A similar ride, \"Blazing Fury\", was built at Herschend Family Entertainment's other theme park, Silver Dollar City Tennessee, in 1978, now known as Dollywood.\n\nFire in the Hole is themed around the story of Marmaros, an Ozarks hill town. Marmaros was built near Marvel Cave and is the present day site of the theme park Silver Dollar City. Marmaros grew out of necessity. The miners attracted to the mining of guano from the cave along with their families began to grow in number. The investors designed a town with the intentions of becoming a resort village such as Eureka Springs, Arkansas or Monte Ne, Arkansas. Investments became substantial and the town's population grew rapidly.\n\nMarmaros’ existence relied heavily upon the mining operation of Marvel Cave. The town failed to attract tourists and began to slowly die out after mining ceased. Much of the town was later destroyed by fire, and what was left moved to a location south of the cave and is now submerged below Table Rock Lake.\n\nThe town was rumored to be burnt to the ground by a group of vigilantes known as the Baldknobbers. Obscure facts have turned into legend which makes deciphering the story virtually impossible. Some believe the burning of the village started out as a drunken fight in a local tavern. Others blame xenophobic outrage over William H. Lynch, a Canadian businessman who purchased Marvel Cave; Lynch would later open the cave as a tourist attraction. Evidence proves that the town did in fact burn, however the true story may never be established.\n\nThe original concept of the ride relied heavily upon Marvel Cave itself. During the planning phases of Fire in the Hole the ride was referred to as The Devil's Den. This was a name given to the cave centuries before mining operation had started. The ride was to include volcanoes and exploding geysers. However, modifications were eventually made and the ride took on its current form.\n\nFire in the Hole's dated production values and odd subject matter have made the ride a cult favorite, with some people even developing \"callback lines\" to shout at various points during the ride. Riders pass scenes of the town's residents trying to extinguish the flames before crossing a collapsing bridge, nearly getting run-over by a steam train, and crashing into a dynamite storage shack. In the ride's finale the coaster trains are sent hurtling over a drop into a pool of water with a splash down finish. The splash has been part of the ride since its conception. Water cannons within the splash down lake can be enhanced during the summer months to drench riders and turned off during the cooler seasons to only mist riders.\n\nThroughout the ride, there are many scenes of Marmaros engulfed in flames. The scenes include a burning hotel, camp of Baldknobbers, blazing cabin, collapsing bridge, and a Main Street which includes a saloon, undertaker and blacksmith shop. A shootout takes place on Main Street between three Baldknobbers and the town sheriff. This results in the undertaker's windows being shot out and bullet holes in the water tower spraying riders.\n\nTo increase rider capacity a large section of track was removed in 1982. After the first dip (Collapsing Bridge) the ride would turn right and later reconnect in front of the second one (Train Collision). At the scene where the cabin is burning, there is a moon and some stars above one of the old track areas. Also, at the sign for “Kinney Bridge”, to rider's left is a large open area where scenes once existed.\n\nThe removed scenes included one with a group of Baldknobbers having the following conversation: \"All right boys remember, don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.\" A gun fires. \"Ow! You damn knocked me (or you damn knock-kneed...) Oh, excuse me kids.\" After that scene, the ride encounters the Baldknobber dumping the barrel on the riders (now moved to another part of the ride). This was followed by a sign reading, \"Danger, Track out ahead\". Coming out of the tunnel, riders saw what appeared to be the track mangled, hanging off a cliff. Just as they headed out over it, the cars cut back sharply on the real track. The track then reconnected with the existing track headed for the train hill.\n\nA song was created in 1972 to accompany the ride. It plays throughout the ride and on the exterior of the building. While waiting in the exterior queue-line one can hear it along with conversations between two men exclaiming the heroic deeds of firefighters.\n\n", "id": "7712713", "categories": ["Roller coasters in Missouri", "Silver Dollar City", "Roller coasters introduced in 1972", "Buildings and structures in Taney County, Missouri"], "title": "Fire in the Hole (Silver Dollar City)"}

The Philippines uses parallel voting for seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn district elections, 219 single-member constituencies elect one member of the House of Representatives. The candidate with the highest number of votes wins that district's seat. In the party-list election, the parties with at least 2% of the national vote were elected, and 21 representatives were elected However, later in 2007 the Supreme Court ruled in \"Banat vs. COMELEC\" that the 2% quota was unconstitutional, and that the sectoral representatives should comprise exactly 20% of the House. This led to the increase in the number of sectoral representatives to 51.\n\nThe administration-led TEAM Unity maintained control of the House of Representatives although the opposition-backed Genuine Opposition won control of the Senate. Incumbent Speaker Jose de Venecia of Pangasinan was elected Speaker after being the only one nominated: 186 voted for De Venecia, 1 against (Eduardo Joson) and 24 abstentions.\n\nThe Genuine Opposition (GO) targeted to win at least 80 seats to be able to impeach President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo; however the administration's TEAM Unity prevented GO in winning several of those seats by fielding in strong candidates against GO in those districts.\n\nThe administration's two main parties, Lakas-CMD and Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (KAMPI), was seen to win majority of the seats, with most contests contested by the two parties. This inevitably produced a split in the administration ranks on who would be their candidate for Speaker in the impending victory. However, the two parties were united in supporting President Arroyo and were able to prevent any impeachment proceeding against her or her allies from reaching the Senate.\n\nLakas-CMD party leader and House Speaker Jose de Venecia was challenged by KAMPI's Pablo P. Garcia for the speakership in the incoming 14th Congress of the Philippines which has caused a battle between administration allies. Recently, Garcia was accused by Parañaque City 1st District Rep. Eduardo Ziacita and Manila 6th District Rep. Bienvenido Abante, Jr. both under the party Lakas-CMD of using Government Service Insurance System or GSIS pension funds care of Garcia's son GSIS Vice-Chairman, General Manager and President Winston Garcia to bribe congressmen of PHP 300,000 to 400,000 to support his father's speakership bid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrict representatives are allocated 80% of the seats in the House:\n\nParty-list representatives are allocated 20% of the seats in the House; however, due to the 2% threshold and the 3-seat cap rule, the 20% requirement was not met. On the \"BANAT vs. COMELEC\" decision of the Supreme Court, it declared the 2% threshold unconstitutional; instead it mandated that parties surpassing the 2% threshold automatically having seats, then allocating one seat for every party with less than 2% of the vote until the 20% allocation was met. With the formula used, this meant that the party with the highest number of votes usually gets three seats, the other parties with 2% or more of the vote winning two seats, and parties with less than 2% of the vote getting one seat.\n\n", "id": "7712749", "categories": ["2007 in the Philippines", "Lower house elections in the Philippines", "2007 Philippine general election"], "title": "2007 Philippine House of Representatives elections"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712754", "text": "Exclamation mark\n\nThe exclamation mark, also sometimes referred to as the exclamation point in American English, is a punctuation mark usually used after an interjection or exclamation to indicate strong feelings or high volume (shouting), or to show emphasis, and often marks the end of a sentence, for example: \"Watch out!\" Similarly, a bare exclamation mark (with nothing before or after) is often used in warning signs.\n\nOther uses include:\n\nGraphically the exclamation mark is represented as a full stop point with a vertical line above. One theory of its origin is that it is derived from a Latin exclamation of joy (\"io\"). The modern graphical representation is believed to have been born in the Middle Ages. Medieval copyists wrote the Latin word \"io\" at the end of a sentence to indicate joy. The word \"io\" meant \"hurray\". Over time, the \"i\" moved above the \"o\", and the \"o\" became smaller, becoming a point.\n\nThe exclamation mark was first introduced into English printing in the 15th century to show emphasis, and was called the \"sign of admiration or exclamation\" or the \"note of admiration\" until the mid-17th century; admiration referred to its Latin sense of wonderment.\n\nThe exclamation mark did not have its own dedicated key on standard manual typewriters before the 1970s. Instead, one typed a period, backspaced, and typed an apostrophe. In the 1950s, secretarial dictation and typesetting manuals in America referred to the mark as \"bang\", perhaps from comic books where the ! appeared in dialogue balloons to represent a gun being fired, although the nickname probably emerged from letterpress printing. This bang usage is behind the names of the interrobang, an unconventional typographic character, and a shebang line, a feature of Unix computer systems.\n\nIn the printing world, the exclamation mark can be called a screamer, a gasper, a slammer, or a startler.\n\nIn hacker culture, the exclamation mark is called \"bang\", \"shriek\", or, in the British slang known as Commonwealth Hackish, \"pling\". For example, the password communicated in the spoken phrase \"Your password is em-nought-pee-aitch-pling-en-three\" is codice_1.\n\nThe exclamation mark is common to languages using the Latin alphabet, although usage varies slightly between languages. It has also been adopted in languages written in other scripts, such as Greek, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Devanagari.\n\nA sentence ending in an exclamation mark may be an exclamation (such as \"Wow!\", \"Boo!\"), or an imperative (\"Stop!\"), or may indicate astonishment or surprise: \"They were the footprints of a gigantic hound!\" Exclamation marks are occasionally placed mid-sentence with a function similar to a comma, for dramatic effect, although this usage is obsolete: \"On the walk, oh! there was a frightful noise.\"\n\nInformally, exclamation marks may be repeated for additional emphasis (\"That's great!!!\"), but this practice is generally considered unacceptable in formal prose.\n\nThe exclamation mark is sometimes used in conjunction with the question mark. This can be in protest or astonishment (\"Out of all places, the squatter-camp?!\"); a few writers replace this with a single, nonstandard punctuation mark, the interrobang, which is the combination of a question mark and an exclamation mark.\n\nOverly frequent use of the exclamation mark is generally considered poor writing, for it distracts the reader and devalues the mark's significance.\n\nSome authors, however, most notably Tom Wolfe and Madison Acampora, are known for unashamedly liberal use of the exclamation mark. In comic books, the very frequent use of exclamation mark is common—see Comics, below.\n\nFor information on the use of spaces after an exclamation mark, see the discussion of spacing after a full stop.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that women use exclamation marks more than men do, and one study suggests that, in addition to other uses, exclamation marks may also function as markers of friendly interaction, for example, by making \"Hi!\" or \"Good luck!\" seem friendlier than simply \"Hi.\" or \"Good luck.\" (with periods).\n\nIn English writing and often subtitles, a (!) symbol (an exclamation mark within parentheses) implies that a character has made an obviously sarcastic comment e.g.: \"\"Ooh, a sarcasm detector. That's a\" really useful\" invention(!)\"\" It also is used to indicate surprise at one's own experience or statement.\n\nIn French, next to marking exclamations or indicating astonishment, the exclamation mark is also commonly used to mark orders or requests: (English: 'Come here!'). A space () is used between the last word and the exclamation mark in European French, but not in Canadian French. One can also combine an exclamation mark with a question mark at the end of a sentence where appropriate.\n\nGerman uses the exclamation mark for several things that English conveys with other punctuation:\n\nCantonese has not historically used exclamation marks. Usage of exclamation marks is common in written Mandarin and in some Yue speaking regions. The Canton and Hong Kong regions, however, generally refused to accept the exclamation mark as it was seen as carrying with it unnecessary and confusing Western connotations; however, an exclamation mark, including in some written representations of colloquy in Cantonese, can be used informally to indicate strong feeling. For example, to represent a response of someone surprised by a gift, one could write: \"\" (, \"thanks!\").\n\nIn Modern Greek, the exclamation mark (, ) has been introduced from Latin scripts and is used identically, although without the reluctance seen in English usage. A minor grammatical difference is that, while a series of interjections each employ an exclamation mark (e.g., , , 'Oops! Oh!'), an interjection should only be separated from an extended exclamation by a comma (e.g., , , 'Oops! I left the stove on.').\n\nIn Hungarian, an exclamation mark is put at the end of exclamations, imperative or prohibitive sentences, and sentences expressing a wish (e.g. - 'How beautiful!', - 'Do not step on the grass.', - 'If only my plan worked out.').\nThe use of the exclamation mark is also needed when addressing someone and the addressing is a separate sentence. (typically at the beginning of letters, e.g. - 'Dear Peter,').\nGreetings are also typically terminated with an exclamation mark (e.g. - 'Good evening.').\n\nIn Spanish, a sentence or clause ending in an exclamation mark must also begin with an inverted exclamation mark (the same also applies to the question mark): , 'Are you crazy? You almost killed her!'\n\nAs in British English, a bracketed exclamation mark may be used to indicate irony or surprise at a statement: , 'He said that he's not going to a party tonight(!).' Such use is not matched by an inverted opening exclamation mark.\n\nIn Turkish, an exclamation mark is used after a sentence or phrase for emphasis, and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the ('Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean') order by Atatürk, ('the armies') constitute the addressee. It is further used in parentheses, , after a sentence or phrase to indicate irony or sarcasm: , 'You've done a very good job – Not!'.\n\nIn Limbu, an exclamation mark is used after a Limbu sentence or phrase for emphasis, and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the Limbu sentence \"ᤐᤚᤢ᥄ ᤄᤨᤘᤑ ᤂᤥᤆᤌᤙ Mediterranean, ᤚᤦᤛᤅ᥄\" — \"Paṡu! Ghōwapha khōcathaśa Mediterranean, ṡausaṅa!\" (Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean!). It is further used in parentheses, (᥄), after a sentence or phrase to indicate irony or sarcasm: \"ᤖᤥᤂᤌ ᤔᤚᤗ ᤐᤤ ᤊᤇ ᤃᤦᤄ (᥄)\" — \"Rōkhatha maṡala pai yancha gaugha (!)\" (You did a very good job — Not!).\n\nIn Khoisan languages, and the International Phonetic Alphabet, the exclamation mark is used as a letter to indicate the postalveolar click sound (represented as \"q\" in Zulu orthography). In Unicode, this letter is properly coded as and distinguished from the common punctuation symbol to allow software to deal properly with word breaks.\n\nThe exclamation mark has sometimes been used as a phonetic symbol to indicate that a consonant is ejective. More commonly this is represented by an apostrophe, or a superscript glottal stop symbol ().\n\nThere is a non–standard punctuation mark intended to combine the functions of a question mark and an exclamation mark in English called interrobang, which resembles those marks superimposed over one another (‽) but it is seldom seen outside Unicode documentation - the sequence of \"?!\" or \"!?\" is used almost exclusively.\n\nAlthough not part of dictionary words, exclamation marks appear in some brand names and trade names, including Yum! Brands (parent of fast food chains like Taco Bell and KFC) and Web services Yahoo! and Joomla!. It appears in the titles of stage and screen works, especially comedies and musicals; examples include the game show \"Jeopardy!\", the '60s musical TV show \"Shindig!\"; musicals \"Oklahoma!\", \"Oliver!\" and \"Oh! Calcutta!\"; and movies \"Airplane!\" and \"Moulin Rouge!\". Writer Elliot S! Maggin and cartoonist Scott Shaw! include exclamation marks in their names. In the 2016 United States presidential campaign, Republican candidate Jeb Bush used \"Jeb!\" as his campaign logo.\n\nThe English town of Westward Ho!, named after the novel by Charles Kingsley, is the only place name in the United Kingdom that officially contains an exclamation mark. There is a town in Quebec called Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, which is spelled with two exclamation marks. The city of Hamilton, Ohio, changed its name to Hamilton! in 1986, but neither the United States Board on Geographic Names nor mapmakers Rand McNally recognised the change. The city of Ostrava, Czech Republic, changed its logotype to Ostrava!!! in 2008.\n\nExclamation marks are used to emphasize a precautionary statement.\n\nOn warning signs, an exclamation mark is often used to draw attention to a warning of danger, hazards, and the unexpected. These signs are common in hazardous environments or on potentially dangerous equipment. A common type of this warning is a yellow triangle with a black exclamation mark, but a white triangle with a red border is common on European road warning signs.\n\nThe mark is encoded as and codice_2 in HTML5.\n\nRelated forms are encoded:\nSome scripts have their own exclamation mark:\n\nIn mathematics, the symbol represents the factorial operation. The expression ! means \"the product of the integers from 1 to \". For example, 4! (read \"four factorial\") is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. (0! is defined as 1, which is a neutral element in multiplication, not multiplied by anything.) Additionally, it can also represent uniqueness or, if used in front of a number, it can represent a subfactorial.\n\nIn linear logic, the exclamation mark denotes one of the modalities that control weakening and contraction.\n\nIn computing, the exclamation mark (sometimes called a \"bang\") corresponds to ASCII character 33 (21 in hexadecimal). It is therefore found in Unicode at . The inverted exclamation mark is found in ISO-8859-1, 9 and 15 at position 161 (A1) and in Unicode at .\n\nThe name given to \"!\" by programmers varies according to their background. In the UK the term pling was popular in the earlier days of computing, whilst in the United States, the term shriek was used. It is claimed that these word usages were invented in the US and \"shriek\" is from Stanford or MIT; however, \"shriek\" for the ! sign is found in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" dating from the 1860s.\n\nSeveral computer languages use \"!\" for various meanings, most importantly for logical negation; e.g. A != B means \"A is not equal to B\", and !A means \"the logical negation of A\" (also called \"not A\"). In the UK, BBC BASIC used pling as an indirection operator, equivalent to PEEK and POKE of four bytes at once.\n\nIn APL, codice_3 is used for factorial as in mathematics (but like all APL functions, preceding its argument) and also for the binomial coefficient, formula_1, written as codice_4.\n\nBCPL, the precursor of C, used \"!\" for pointer and array indirection: \"!P\" was equivalent to C's \"*P\" and \"P!3\" is equivalent to \"P[3]\" in C.\n\nPlings are also used in Acorn RISC OS to denote an application directory: a folder that when double-clicked executes a program file inside called \"!Run\". Other files in the appfolder generally contain resources the application needs to run. The appfolder can be viewed as a normal folder by double-clicking with the shift key held down. In addition, other special resource files such as \"!Boot\" (executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the filer), \"!Sprites\" (an icon file containing icon definitions loaded if \"!Boot\" cannot be found) and \"!Help\" (a text, HTML or other executable file listed in the filer menu for the application) also start with a pling.\n\nEarly e-mail systems also used the exclamation mark as a separator character between hostnames for routing information, usually referred to as \"bang path\" notation.\n\nIn the IRC protocol, a user's nickname and ident are separated by an exclamation mark in the hostmask assigned to him or her by the server.\n\nIn the Geek Code version 3, \"!\" is used before a letter to denote that the geek refuses to participate in the topic at hand. In some cases, it has an alternate meaning, such as \"G!\" denoting a geek of no qualifications, \"!d\" denoting not wearing any clothes, \"P!\" denoting not being allowed to use Perl, and so on. They all share some negative connotations, however.\n\nWhen computer programs display messages that alert the user, an exclamation mark may be shown alongside it to indicate that the message is important and should be read. This often happens when an error is made, or to obtain user consent for hazardous operations such as deleting data.\n\nIn UNIX scripting (typically for UNIX shell or Perl), \"!\" is usually used after a \"#\" in the first line of a script, the interpreter directive, to tell the OS what program to use to run the script. The \"#!\" is usually called a \"hash-bang\" or shebang. A similar convention for PostScript files calls for the first line to begin with \"%!\", called \"percent-bang\".\n\nAn exclamation mark starts history expansions in many Unix shells such as bash and tcsh where codice_5 executes the previous command and codice_6 refers to all of the arguments from the previous command.\n\nIn the ML programming language (including Standard ML and OCaml), \"!\" is the operator to get the value out of a \"reference\" data structure.\n\nIn the Haskell programming language, \"!\" is used to express strictness.\n\nIn the Scheme and Ruby programming languages, \"!\" is conventionally the suffix for functions and special forms that mutate their input.\n\nIn the Swift programming language, a type followed by \"!\" denotes an \"implicitly unwrapped optional\", an option type where the compiler does not enforce safe unwrapping. The \"!\" operator \"force unwraps\" an option type, causing an error if it is nil.\n\nIn the Perl 6 programming language, the \"!\" twigil is used to access private attributes or methods in a class (like codice_7 or codice_8).\n\nThe exclamation mark can be used in video games to signify that a character is startled or alarmed. In the \"Metal Gear\" and \"Paper Mario\" series, an exclamation mark appears over enemies' heads when they notice the player.\n\nIn the 2005 arcade dance simulation game \"In the Groove 2\", there is a song titled \"!\" (also referred to as \"bang\") by the artist Onyx.\n\nIn recent Internet culture, especially where leet is used, multiple exclamation marks may be affixed with the numeral \"1\" as in \"!!!!!!111\". The notation originates from a common error: when typing multiple exclamation points quickly, the typist may fail to hold the combination that produces the exclamation mark on many keyboard layouts. This error, first used intentionally as a joke in the leet linguistic community, is now an accepted form of exclamation in leet and derivative dialects such as Lolspeak. Some utterances include further substitutions, for example \"!!!111oneeleven\".\n\nIn fandom and fanfiction, ! is used to signify a defining quality in a character, usually signifying an alternative interpretation of a character from a canonical work. Examples of this would be \"Romantic!Draco\" or \"Vampire!Harry\" from Harry Potter fandom. It is also used to clarify the current persona of a character with multiple identities or appearances, such as to distinguish \"Armor!Al\" from \"Human!Al\" in a work based on Fullmetal Alchemist. The origin of this usage is unknown, although it is hypothesized to have originated with certain Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures, for example, \"Football Player! Leonardo\", \"Rockstar! Raphael\", and \"Breakdancer! Michelangelo\".\n\nSome comic books, especially superhero comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the exclamation point instead of the period, which means the character has just realized something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or they do not know what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other hyperboles common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period Stan Lee, as Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics, attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.\n\nComic book writer Elliot S! Maggin once accidentally signed his name with an exclamation due to the habit of using them when writing comic scripts; it became his professional name from then on. Similarly, comic artist Scott Shaw! has used the exclamation point after his name throughout his career.\n\nIn comic books and comics in general, a large exclamation point is often used near or over a character's head to indicate surprise. A question mark can similarly be used to indicate confusion.\n\nIn chess notation denotes a good move, denotes an excellent move, \"?!\" denotes a dubious move, and \"!?\" denotes an interesting, risky move. In some chess variants such as large-board Shogi variants, \"!\" is used to record pieces capturing by stationary feeding or burning.\n\nIn Scrabble, an exclamation mark written after a word is used to indicate its presence in the Official Tournament and Club Word List but its absence from the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, usually because the word has been judged offensive.\n\nExclamation points or asterisks can be used on scorecards to denote a \"great defensive play\".\n\nThe band !!! (pronounced \"Chk Chk Chk\") uses exclamation points as its name.\n\nIn 2008, the pop-punk band Panic! at the Disco dropped the exclamation point in its name; this became the \"most-discussed topic on [fan] message boards around the world\". In 2009, the exclamation mark was re-inserted following the band's split.\n\nThe band Bomb the Music Industry! utilizes an exclamation mark in its name, as well as several album and song titles and promotional material. Examples include their songs \"(Shut) Up The Punx!!!\" and the album \"\".\n\nAmerican musician Pink stylizes her stage name \"P!NK\", and uses three exclamation points in the subtitle of her 2010 release, \"Greatest Hits... So Far!!!.\n\nThe exclamation mark was included in the title of Dinah Shore's TV series, \"Dinah!\" The exclamation mark was later the subject of a bitter argument between Elaine Benes and her boyfriend, Jake Jarmel, in the \"Seinfeld\" episode, \"The Sniffing Accountant\". Elaine got upset with Jake for not putting an exclamation mark at the end of a message about her friend having a baby. Jake took extreme exception to the trivial criticism and broke up with Elaine, putting an exclamation mark after his parting words: \"I'm leaving!\"\n\nIn musicals, an exclamation mark is usually used when the title of the show has the same title of a song within the act. Examples of this are shows like \"Oklahoma!\" and \"Mamma Mia!\".\n\n\n", "id": "7712754", "categories": [], "title": "Exclamation mark"}

The City Council has one mayor and eight council members, who are elected for four year terms. The City Council has the power to write the laws of the city, budget the city's finances, and make other decisions for the city. The City Council holds meetings on the first floor of the Tacoma Municipal Building.\n\nThe current system for the Tacoma City Council was established in 1952. Prior to this date, Tacoma's government consisted of elected commissioners, who frequently plagued the city with corruption. Voters chose to replace the old system with a city council (including the mayor) to pass laws and a city manager to enforce them, also known as the Council–manager system. The council–manager system remains Tacoma's governmental structure today.\n\nUnder the Open Public Meetings Act of 1971, Washington state law requires the Tacoma City Council to allow members of the public to listen in on its meetings. In 1999, Cheryl Miller sued the Council for voting down her application to serve on the Tacoma City Planning Commission during executive session, during which doors were closed to the public. The Washington Supreme Court agreed with Miller. In \"Miller vs. City of Tacoma\", the court ruled that in executive session, the Council could deliberate and \"evaluate\" nominees, but a vote choosing between nominees overstepped the boundaries of an evaluation. Even though the vote was not a formal one, it still violated the public's right to transparency. Miller was compensated only for her attorney fees and court costs as the Supreme Court ruled that the council members did not break the law intentionally.\n\nThis issue of public transparency has not been fully resolved. Similar situations have occurred where the Tacoma City Council allegedly held informal votes on candidates in secret, such as a 2010 executive session to fill two vacancies on the Council.

He was an erstwhile President of the Indian National Science Academy and National Research Professor of the Government of India.\n\nHe was awarded the Padma Vibushan in 2005 for his contributions to health technology in India. He was made a Chevalier in the order of Palmes Academiques, an honour bestowed by the French government, in 1999. He received the Dr. Samuel P. Asper International \nAward from the Johns Hopkins University Medical School in 2009 for his contributions to international medical education.\n\nHe was born to Marthanda and Janaki Varma in 1934. His early education was at a government school in Mavelikara, followed by the University College, Trivandrum. Valiathan's medical education took place at the Medical College, Trivandum, University of Kerala, where he obtained his M B B S degree(1951-1956). He later went to the University of Liverpool in Liverpool, England as a surgical trainee and received his fellowship from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and England in 1960 and Master's degree in surgery from the University of Liverpool. After a brief stint as a faculty member at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh he underwent further training in cardiac surgery at the Johns Hopkins, George Washington, and Georgetown University Hospitals, USA. He worked as a Fellow of Doctors Vincent Gott at the Hopkins and Charles Hufnagel at the Georgetown University He was also granted the fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada in cardiovascular surgery in 1970.\n\nHe has served on the faculty of the Georgetown University Hospital, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and as director of Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology. Subsequently, Valiathan became the first Vice-Chancellor of Manipal University in 1994.\n\nIn 1972, Valiathan returned to India and had an uncertain beginning at the Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi. Soon after he moved to Indian Institute of Technology Madras where his responsibility was teaching with low priority for research. Several friends and colleagues, including Dr. Hufnagel wondered whether he had made a foolish mistake in opting to leave the United States. However he received an invitation from the Government of Kerala where the Chief Minister, Shri Achutha Menon, asked him to develop a hospital for specialities in the new, unoccupied building of Sree Chitra Tirunal Center, Trivandrum, and gave him freedom and authority to accomplish the task.The hospital was set up in two years and patients with cardiovascular and neurologic diseases admitted for treatment. Simultaneously the development of cardiovascular devices was initiated with the support of the Science and Engineering Research Council of the Government of India. As Sree Chitra Institute grew, it received support from prime minister Morarji Desai and was notified as \"An Institution of National Importance\" by an Act of Parliament within five years of Dr.Valiathan's leadership . In 1975, the demand for prosthetic valves was high in the hospital, which could not be met by imported valves in view of prohibitive cost. The state of Kerala had but one licensed abattoir at that time in Koothattukulam, which slaughtered less than 200 pigs per month and made procine valve development unviable. As autopsies were much fewer, homograft valve development was even less viable. Under these circumstances, Dr. Valiathan and his team opted to develop a mechanical valve of tilting-disc design. The currently marketed Chitra-TTK valve is the fourth model in a series that was developed over a decade of effort. In the first model, the major and minor struts were electron beam welded and the valve was expected to withstand 360 million cycles of disc movement. Unfortunately, the major strut fractured at the weld after a mere 100,000 cycles due to weld embrittlement. In the second model, the disk was made of single crystal sapphire which was inert and blood compatible. The housing was carved out of a block of titanium. This model failed as well because of extensive wear of titanium struts and escape of the disc. The third model had a housing made of a highly wear- resistant superalloy, \"Haynes-25\", a cobalt based alloy of chromium, nickel and tungsten. This model went through all the tests successfully and several sheep with the implanted valve were alive and well for months until the death of one animal at 3 months after valve implantation. Necropsy showed that the sapphire disc had fractured and caused the death of the animal. This was a major crisis as critics and media did not spare the Chitra team. However the fourth model was a success and more than 100,000 valves have been implanted in patients (till 2016).The multidisciplinary team at the Sree Chitra Institute led by Dr.Valiathan also developed a vascular graft and a series of disposable devices such as blood bag, oxygenator and cardiotomy reservoir, which are in commercial production in industrial units in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.\n\nAfter about twenty years at Sri Chitra, Dr.Valiathan became the Vice-Chancellor of the newly set up Manipal University (then MAHE, Manipal Academy of Higher Education).\n\nAfter laying down office as Vice-Chancellor in 1999, he was awarded a Senior Fellowship by the Homi Bhabha Council to pursue a study of Charaka, which culminated in the publication a book \"The Legacy of Charaka\". Later on, as a National Research Professor, he carried out a study of Sushruta and Vagbhata and completed the series of Legacy volumes on the ` Great Three' of Ayurveda.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Valiathan had observed, \"At this time there is no common ground where physicists, chemists, immunologists and molecular biologists can interact with Ayurvedic physicians. Ayurveda is not only the mother of medicine but also of all life sciences in India. In spite of it, science has been completely divorced from Ayurveda... But these are the interdisciplinary areas where advances will take place.\"\nEarlier in another article, he had written, \"To ignore the testimony of thousands of patients over many decades is reminiscent of the derisive attitude of Edward Jenner's contemporaries in Gloucestershire who despised the claim of milkmaids that cow pox gave them protection from small pox! When Jenner wrote to his mentor John Hunter on the observed facts and the arguments against it, Hunter gave his famous reply, \"Why think? Why not experiment?\". That applies to Ayurveda whose time to experiment has arrived.\n\nCurrently, Dr. Valiathan is engaged in promoting research in basic sciences, based on cues from Ayurvedic concepts and procedures. The research in prominent institutes is being supported by government funding in \"A Science Initiative in Ayurveda\" (ASIIA). In his report, during the seventeenth meeting of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet (SAC-C) in 2009, under the Chairmanship of Dr. R. Chidambaram,\nPrincipal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, Dr.Valiathan lauded the support of the Indian government while presenting an update on ongoing projects. ASIIA made good progress and has been taken over by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, for sustained support under a \"Task Force in Ayurvedic Biology\", which appears on the SERB website. He has also given a course of video lectures on ` The Ayurvedic Inheritance of India ' under the NPTEL programme of the IITs of India ( https://web.archive.org/web/20151028200338/http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/). These lectures provided the material for his book ` Ayurvedic Inheritance ; A Reader's Companion'published by Manipal University Press in 2017.\n\nDr.Valiathan's contributions to medical sciences and technology have brought him many honours and awards such as the Fellowships of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Sciences, India, National Academy of Medical Sciences, Indian National Academy of Engineering, The World Academy of Sciences, American College of Cardiology, the Royal College of Physicians of London and the International Union of Societies of Biomaterials and Engineering.

The design planned for an improved \"Richelieu\" design with three triple or quadruple 380mm turrets (two fore, one aft). Six names were proposed, and two had to be chosen from this list: \"Alsace\", \"Normandie\", \"Flandre\", \"Bourgogne\"; two more units were not given names. The laying down of the lead ship of the class, \"Alsace\", was planned for 1941; with the Fall of France in 1940, none of the ships were built.\n\nIn 1936, the second London naval disarmament conference failure marked the end of the international naval armament limitation policy. Japan had withdrawn from the conference on January 15. Italy also declined to sign the treaty. A so-called \"escalator clause\" was included at the urging of American negotiators, allowing the signatory countries of the Second London Treaty—France, the United Kingdom and the United States—to raise the battleship main artillery caliber limit from to , and the battleship Washington tonnage limit from 35,000 tons to 45,000 tons, if Japan or Italy still refused to sign after . So, the United States adopted the 16-inch gun for their new fast battleship classes, the United Kingdom chose to respect the Second London Naval Treaty limitations for the battleships, Germany was not concerned as she had not been invited to the second London naval disarmament conference, but officially, the battleships and did have 380 mm guns and 35,000 tons. So France decided to respect the limitation of 35,000 tons and 380mm, as long as no continental European power had overtaken them. It was with these considerations in mind that the new Chef d'Etat-major Général de la Marine, Admiral Darlan, was ordered, in late 1937, to study new designs for two more battleships, as trials were starting to confirm some critical issue with her design, especially her all forward quadruple turret main artillery, and her dual purpose (anti-aircraft and anti-ship) secondary artillery of relatively light caliber.\n\nThree projects were studied, the first (project A) with the same quadruple arrangement forward as , but different secondary artillery dispositions, the second (project B) with one quadruple turret forward and one quadruple turret aft, the third (project C) with two fore triple turrets and one triple turret aft, in every case with a 380 mm caliber. The project C was leading to an excess of nearly 2500 tons over the limit of 35,000 tons, so it was not proposed to the Chef d'Etat-major Général de la Marine.\n\nIn June 1938, Admiral Darlan chose the project A variant 2, for the first battleship to be laid down of the second pair of \"Richelieu\"-class battleships. She received the name of \"Clemenceau\", and he chose the project B variant 3, for the second ship with whose design he was much involved, and gave her the name of \"Gascogne\", the French province where he was born. These French Admiralty choices were tightly linked with the necessity of a maximum use of shipyards where big ships might be built.\n\nSo, the , in Brest Navy Yards, was planned to be ready for a new battleship building in late 1938 – early 1939, after the \"Richelieu\" will have to be launched, or more exactly, floated up. It was not possible to leave the dock empty for at least six months, waiting to build a Project B design battleship after it had been ordered, as it would have necessitated at least one year to put up definitive drawings. So, the Project A design had to be chosen necessarily for the first battleship to be laid down in the Salou graving dock. Thus, the in Saint-Nazaire, in which was being built \"Jean Bart\", expected to leave it for October 1940, could be used for the second battleship to be laid down. Therefore, \"Richelieu\" being floated up on 17 January 1939, \"Clemenceau\" was laid down, this same day. Eighteen months later, \"Jean Bart\" left her berth nearly in sight of German vanguards, on 19 June 1940, so \"Gascogne\" was never laid down.\n\nDuring the summer of 1939, the French intelligence services warned the French Admiralty that the keels of two German battleships, supposed to displace 40,000 tons and mount 406 mm guns, actually Plan Z H-39-class battleships, had been laid down. It was considered then that it was time to surpass the limits of 35,000 tons and even 380 mm. On the basis of the 1938 studies on Project C, new battleship designs emerged, which led to the so-called \"Province\"- or \"Alsace\"-class battleships.\n\nThree types of battleships were studied, all with the same main artillery arrangement, two turrets forward, one turret aft, and the same secondary artillery arrangement (152 mm caliber), all on center line, one triple turret forward, two triple turrets in superfiring position aft, between the funnel and the aft main artillery turret, as on the C3 version of projects for 1938 bis program.\n\nThey differed on two points:\n\nFirst, the main artillery consists in triple 380 mm turrets, for type n°1, in 406 mm triple turrets, for type n°2, in 380 mm quadruple turrets, for type n°3.\n\nSecond, the anti aircraft artillery, consisting in every case of dual mountings of 100 mm caliber (so-called pseudo turrets), would have counted eight mountings, on types n° 1 and 2, twelve mountings on type n° 3.\n\nThe armour is nearly the same (belt: 330 mm on type n°1 and n°2, 350 mm on type n°3; upper armoured deck :170–180 mm; lower armoured deck: 40 mm) and the propulsion assuring the same speed (31.5 knots) as , so the length of the hull, the power of propulsion machinery, and the Washington tonnage are varying from 252 m, and 40,000 tons for the type n°1, 256 m, and 42,500 tons for the type n°2, to 265 m, and 45,000 tons for the type n°3.\n\nAs seen above, the type n°1 would have been similar to s, for the main artillery, in arrangement and in caliber, and an anti-ship secondary artillery which would have counted one triple turret less, but with a disposition on an axial line, the broadside would have been 50% more powerful, and the anti-aircraft artillery, with a slightly bigger caliber (100 mm instead of 90 mm) would have counted the same number of barrels. It also may be described as something between , with one more 381 mm gun, and the s, with a main artillery of only 380 mm caliber.\n\nThe type n°2 would have been similar to the , and battleships, regarding the main armament, in caliber and in arrangement. The top speed would have been higher, 30 kn instead of 28 kn for the U.S. Navy battleships concerned, with consequently a longer hull, more horsepower and an enlarged displacement. The choice of a dual-caliber secondary artillery instead of a dual-purpose one is characteristic of the Continental European navies at the beginning of the Second World War; the lack of a robust light anti-aircraft battery is also consistent with contemporary practice that was soon outstripped by events.\n\nThe type n°3 would have retained a distinguishing feature of French capital ships: the quadruple turret. The French Navy advocated such a battery arrangement consistently, incorporating it into the designs of the proposed and classes of battleship in the First World War, and then bringing it into practice on the \"Dunkerque\"-, \"Richelieu\"-, and \"Gascogne\"-classes. The secondary artillery would have been near of which will have been fitted on as completed post war (9 × 152 mm and 24 × 100 mm), except the lack of fourteen AA 57 mm dual mountings and twenty 20 mm single mountings.\n\nThe French Admiralty is reported to have chosen the type n°1, the nearest of \"Richelieu\" design, and discarded the type n°2, because of the delays to perfect the 406mm guns, a new device for the French Navy, and considered the type n°3 dimensions excessive, being nearly those of s (270 m, , 45,000 tons).\n\nThe first unit was intended to be laid down on 1941, in the Penhoët shipyards, where the transatlantic liner , and later the battleship had been built, and where the was being built. However, this choice would have deferred the building of the second aircraft carrier of the , clearly showing the higher priority granted, in this time, to battleships over aircraft carriers by the French Admiralty.\n\nThe second unit would have had to be laid down on 1942 in a new dock which was intended to be built in the Brest Navy Yards.\n\nThe names of two French provinces would have been chosen from among \"Alsace\", \"Normandie\", \"Flandre\" and \"Bourgogne\", but with the 1940 France defeat, these battleships were never ordered, no work was ever begun, and no material stored. French province names were used for French capital ships at the time such as s and s. They had also been considered for nuclear attack submarines, and are nowadays in use for \"Aquitaine\"-class second generation stealth frigates.\n\n", "id": "7712818", "categories": ["Battleships of the French Navy", "Battleship classes"], "title": "Alsace-class battleship"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712849", "text": "Machismo\n\nMachismo (; ; (from Spanish and Portuguese \"\"macho\"\", male) is the sense of being 'manly' and self-reliant, the concept associated with \"a strong sense of masculine pride: an exaggerated masculinity.\" It is associated with \"a man's responsibility to provide for, protect, and defend his family.\"\n\nThe word has a long history in both Spain and Portugal as well as in Spanish and Portuguese languages. It was originally associated with the ideal societal role men were expected to play in their communities, most particularly, Iberian language-speaking societies and countries. in Portuguese and Spanish is a strictly masculine term, derived from the Latin \"mascŭlus\" meaning male (today or , c.f. Portuguese and now-obsolete for humans ; \"macho\" and , in their most common sense, are used for males of non-human animal species). Machos in Iberian-descended cultures are expected to possess and display bravery, courage and strength as well as wisdom and leadership, and \"ser macho\" (literally, \"to be a macho\") was an aspiration for all boys.\n\nDuring the women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the term began to be used by Latin American feminists to describe male aggression, violence and toxic masculinity. The term was used by Latina feminists and scholars to criticize the patriarchal structure of gendered relations in Latino communities. Their goal was to describe a particular Latin American brand of patriarchy.\n\n\"\" in Spanish, or in Portuguese, or the English mixture of both but not a proper word in any of the previously mentioned languages, \"caballerismo\", is a Latin American understanding of manliness that focuses more on honour and chivalry. The meaning of \"caballero\" is \"gentleman\" (derived from the one who follows a code of honour like knights used to do, or shares certain values and ideals associated with them that included, among others like a particular pride in honour, treating women kindly with especial delicacy and attention).\nLatin American scholars have noted that positive descriptors of machismo resemble the characteristics associated with the concept of caballerosidad. Understandings of machismo in Latin American cultures are not all negative; they also involve the characteristics of honour, responsibility, perseverance and courage, related to both individual and group interaction. Studies show Latin American men understand masculinity to involve considerable childcare responsibilities, politeness, respect for women's autonomy, and non-violent attitudes and behaviors. In this way, machismo comes to mean both positive and negative understanding of Latin American male identity within the immigrant context. Therefore, machismo, like all social constructions of identity, should be understood as having multiple layers.\n\nThe word originates from the Spanish word , Spanish for \"horseman\". refers to a chivalric masculine code of behavior. (Note that the English term also stems from the Latin root caballus, through the French chevalier). Like the English chivalric code, developed out of a medieval socio-historical class system in which people of wealth and status owned horses for transportation and other forms of horsepower whereas the lower classes did not. It was also associated with the class of knights in the feudal system. In Spanish, referred to a land-owning colonial gentleman of high station who was master of estates and/or ranches.\n\nThere is controversy surrounding the concept of machismo as originally from Spanish and Portuguese descent. The use of Spanish and Portuguese produces historical colonial connotations through its promotion of Spanish and Portuguese masculine social construction, when the term should be used to describe specific Latin American historical masculinities. However, the word \"machismo\" does resemble words in Spanish and Portuguese language which is the cause why it is often associated with Spain and Portugal. In addition, by identifying machismo as a form of Europeanness, it offers legitimacy to the concept of a wicked formed of the same Western hypermasculinity known to Protestant Reforme-derived cultures and subjugates Latin America's understanding of itself and its cultural history and peculiarities.\n\nFor example, the use of , Cavalheirismo,to mean only the positive characteristics of machismo is imbued with feudal and colonial connotations relating to colonial power relations. This is because the origin of the word resides in feudal Spanish descriptions of landlords that reached through and into the colonial era, exalts European culture in comparison to the so-called Latin American machismo (animalesque, irrational, violent, backward). It cannot be avoided in Portuguese as , the word for the more acceptable parts of \"machismo\", is itself a loanword from Spanish presenting a palatalization process that Portuguese did not experience (the Portuguese word for a horseman is , and for horsemanship it has ).\n\nResearchers are concerned regarding the unbalanced representation of machismo within Latin American cultures, and are now focused on creating a balanced representation. They have repeatedly pointed out the positive characteristics consistent with machismo, or : nurturance, protection of the family and its honor, dignity, wisdom, hard work, responsibility, spirituality, and emotional connectedness. Latin American scholars propose there are really two different constructs within machismo, one positive construct and one negative construct. The negative construct of machismo is based on the traditional Western concept of hypermasculinity, and is predominant within mainstream discourse, without an acknowledgement towards its resemblance towards hypermasculinty. 's characteristics are exalted, while machismo's characteristics are seen as predominantly negative.\n\nThe other side of machismo, the positive side (, ), refers to a connection to family and chivalry. However, the focus on the negative aspects and avoidance of positive aspects of machismo coincides with the concept of marginalization and powerlessness of Hispanic and Latino, and more broadly Romance-speaking European culture-derived, narratives. This is because the focus on the negative and avoidance of the positive creates a power dynamic that legitimizes mainstream American hegemonic masculinity as the correct masculinity and subjugates machismo as a degenerated \"non-white\" form of abuse against women and backwardness. As a result, it creates a sense of powerlessness within Latino males in their expression of their masculinity.\n\nThe phenomena of gender-based belief systems having negative and positive effects is described as ambivalent sexism, which is made of hostile sexism and benevolent sexism.\n\nAcademics have noted that there are consequences of only having a negative definition for Hispanic and Latino masculinity in popular literature. Researchers have suggested that, according to the Eurocentric (and to a certain degree anti-Catholic and/or Nordicist) views dominant in mainstream white American culture, Latin American manifestations of machismo represent \"all that is wrong in a man\". Latino academics have used this argument to explain why Latino male youth struggle in academic institutions and have high rates of criminality. These are the same discourses that argue that Latino masculinity (machismo) is defined by violence, recklessness, and misogyny. Accordingly, they link these expressions as contributing to a lack of interest in academics as well as behavioural struggles in schools for Latino male youth.\n\nThroughout popular literature, the term has continued to be associated with negative characteristics, such as sexism, misogyny, chauvinism, hypermasculinity, and hegemonic masculinity. Scholars characterize macho men as violent, rude, womanizing, and prone to alcoholism. Authors from a various disciplines typified macho men as domineering through intimidation, seducing and controlling women and children through violence and intimidation.\n\nFor example, in American literature, an example of machismo comes from Tennessee Williams' character Stanley Kowalski, an egotistical brother-in-law, from \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". In the play (and 1951 film adaptation), Stanley epitomizes the tough, alpha-male (hypermasculine) archetype, socially and physically dominating and imposing his will upon his wife and her sister, Blanche Dubois. Bound up with Stanley's aggressive and occasionally misogynistic views is a strong sense of pride and honor which leads to his hatred of Blanche.\n\nIn the play \"A View from the Bridge\" by Arthur Miller, one of the main characters, Eddie, is a classic type who displays machismo. He wants to be the best of the men around him and when beaten, becomes very agitated and increasingly irrational. The negative stereotypes depicted in American literature are not representative of all the different layers of machismo.\n\nMachismo has been influenced and supported by many different factors. The Catholic religion plays a vital role to many within the Spanish community. For this reason the male dominated world that is often referenced in the Bible is seen among the people. Examples can be found throughout the Bible showing how women should be submissive to their husbands: “Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee” (Genesis 3:16). The ideologies that the man is stronger, the moneymaker, and the protector all back up the mindset that wives must listen to their husbands.\n\nThe revolution of copper mining sets the tone of traditional masculinity. The industrious labor performed by the working class male is accredited by status amongst peers and ability to provide for the family. Men who work in the mines are often away from their families’ the majority of the time so they engage in homosociality. The homosocial leisure activities that the workers engage in consist of gambling, soccer, and alcohol. Women's presence in social settings is not prominent, so men's dominance and inevitable homosocial interactions create kinship and brotherhood. Exploitation of masculinity through the context of miners is prominent and embodied by Chilean males.\n\nAs a colony of the U.S Puerto Rico tends to take on the same progressive movements as U.S. These movements include LGBTQ rights, minority rights, and equality. In regards to equality and what separates men and women, gender roles determine what is socially acceptable in different geographical areas. In Puerto Rico the machismo culture has or had a strong presence. Men were to work outside the home, manage the finances, and make the decisions. Women were to be subordinate to their husbands and be the homemakers. Women would often would have to be dependent on men for everything. Growing up boys are taught to the machismo code girls are taught the marianismo code. Machismo is a term originating in the early 1930s and 40s best defined as having masculinity and Pride. Machismo is a factor challenged among different groups due to how an ideal man is expected to be portrayed which builds pressure. Mentally men may feel the need to take up more opportunities to meet expectations, such as supporting the home, or maintaining employment leading to stress. This may also take a toll as physically well straining to be strong and overexerting the body, or the opposite of putting on weight by not having the desired physique and feeling inferior. This is further expressed through Puerto Ricans Americans outside the island.\n\nHowever, the roles are beginning to shift as women's rights and equality movements sweep the mainland, Puerto Rico is beginning to feel the effects. While Puerto Ricans may be motivated by the progressive of the mainland they base their movements off of their situations in Puerto Rico. Beginning in the 1950s the employment rate for women began to rise as the employment rate fell due to the island's industrialization. Also, during the 1950s to 1980s the field of the white collar women emerged furthering the rise in women employment. However, women were not released from their homemaker duties because they had a job. In fact, women were now expected to contribute to the household's finances and be the homemaker. This caused a shift in what was acceptable in households. Men used to be able to come and go as they pleased as the women were dependent on them, however, after contributing to the household, acquiring more education, and being the homemaker women became more independent and conscious. They no longer tolerated unfaithful men, controlling men, and violent men. This caused great inner conflict with the idea of the machismo culture. In present day society this machismo culture is still oppressed as Puerto Rico in 2016 was the only place where women made more than men, at $1.03 for every $1.\n\nIn Chicago where there is a big Puerto Rican community; Puerto Ricans are feeling threatened of their American dream. Young Puerto Rican women are expected to stay at home reproductively, as well as for the cultural reasons of productively being at home. There are rules made by Latin families that young women should not be influenced by the dangers of outside, for the portrayal of young women to be sexualized or vulnerable. They are raised with these strict rules because some women experience pregnancy at a young age, and are not familiar to care for both themselves nor the responsibilities of a new child. Young women may even lack support from their own household families, and are blamed for not being properly educated. Puerto Rican families influenced by American culture; may express to bend traditional rules. These families do what they believe is best for their family, and further educate about sexual education and learn while virginity is valued until marriage.\n\nLGBTQ community is also a conflicting issue to the machismo culture. Puerto Rico is known for its strong Christian community along with having a smaller Jewish and Muslim community as well. Due to changing times and influence from America the LGBTQ movement has been a strong force for equality, which in Puerto Rico has not always been accepted; and even harmed in the process due to difference. A new term to differentiate gender is Latinx, and Latine a variant used to pronounce easily throughout Latin America is a gender neutral form of addressing someone compared to the familiar male Latino or female Latina. Minorities are treated differently in Puerto Rico despite the blending of three races. Puerto Ricans face racism amongst themselves in their community and at work solely based on their color of their skin. People with even the slightest pigment were not considered white, and segregation exist within the island; where minorities may live in different regions of the island with others of color.\n\nTherefore, the pre-Columbian use of the word \"macho\" had to do with wisdom and leadership that was worthy of imitation, while gender was not involved. When the Spanish came, their use of the word was strictly masculine. Therefore, after the Spanish invasion a new word, idea and concept was born: that a macho was a masculine leader, who was enlightened and worthy of imitation. It was always a positive term. Therefore, in Mexico, the use of the word \"macho\" may provoke confusion if it is not used precisely or in context.\n\nMachismo is a source of pride for men and they must prove their manliness by upholding their dominance in their reputation and their household. Machismo comes from the assertion of male dominance in everyday life. Examples of this would be men dominating their wives, controlling their children, and demanding the utmost respect from others in the household. Machismo has become deeply woven in Cuban society and have created barriers for women to reach full equality. The reason for this is the patriarchy that runs high in Cuban society. Cuba's patriarchal society stems from the fact that Spain has had a history of using brutal war tactics and humiliation as a means to keep and establish their power. Tomas de Torquemada, who ruled as a grand inquisitor under King Ferdinand and Queen Elizabeth of Spain, used degrading and humiliating forms of torture to get information out of prisoners. Men like Torquemada create the domino effect throughout history of repressive and toxic masculinity that has plagued Cuban society. Machismo is also a modernized ideology from Islamic and African cultures of structured hierarchy of only male chief, sub-chiefs.\n\nIn Uva de Aragon Clavijo's, novel \"El Caiman Ante El Espejo\" , Clavijo claims that Cubans feel more power from the genital organs of previous male generals like General Antonio Maceo Grajales of the Cuban fight for independence. Grajales was the embodiment of male power and dominance. Due to the long list of past male Cuban leaders like Fidel Castro. Even though he represented a revolution, he was still a powerful and dominating man who ruled over the people. In the point of view of Clavijo, militarism and caudillismo, are what is to blame for Cuban machismo, as it established the ideology of the “leadership of the strongman” which proved to be successful in Castro becoming victorious in his revolution. Thus furthering that a male dominated political society is superior. Despite Castro's leading a socialist revolution, it only seems to reinforce macho-control over the Cuban people, specifically for Cuban woman who have yet to occupy any established political positions.\n\nThe idea of the male ego, where the male is symbolized as “hyper-masculine, virile, strong, paternalistic, aggressive, sexually dominant, and unfaithful” is reinforced by the teachings of the Catholic Church, the main religion practiced in Cuba and Latina America in general. According to Catholic Church teachings, the female should be a virgin and faithful to her husband, but by contrast, the male has more sexual freedom. During colonial times, a female's chastity and demureness were linked to the family's societal standings [new], while the males were expected and sometimes pressured into proving their sexual prowess by having multiple partners\".\" There was a duality in the expression of love. Men were supposed to express between physical loves, while women were expected to only express spiritual love. Even after marriage, carnal love was frowned upon if the woman expressed it too vigorously, instead she was supposed to be more delighted by the possibility of having and raising children as a means to express the love.\n\nBecause of the objectification of women\",\" domestic violence often ignored when women decide to seek help from the police\".\" Domestic abuse victims are given psychological counseling as a way to cope with their trauma, but little is done criminally to solve the problem. Domestic Abuse cases or other violent crimes committed against women, are very rarely reported on by the media, and the government does not release statistics that show the people the extent of the crimes. The Cuban Revolution changed some of the ways the people of Cuba viewed women. Fidel Castro in his own words saw that the women were going through ‘a revolution within the revolution, and established the Federation of Cuban Women (FMC). This organization, headed by Vilma Espin, Castro's sister in law, helped women establish themselves better into the working world and in women's right issues. The FMC has continually advocated for women rights and in 1997 created the \"Grupo Nacional para la Prevencion y Atencion de la Violencia Familiar\", a national group whose purpose is to study and find measures on how to get help for the women who fall victim to domestic violence. With the help of the FMC and the \"Grupo Nacional para la Prevencion y Atencion de la Violencia Familiar,\" women can file claims against their abusers at the Office of Victim Rights. They are also now able to get access to sexual abuse therapies. This by no way solves the issue of domestic abuse, but it is a turning point for the Cuban women who are now no longer feel powerless in the fight.\n\nBecause Machismo is so entrenched into the very systems that keep women oppressed, women in Cuba don't hold political or monetary positions of power. While there are 48.9% of women in Cuban Congress, the political group that holds the most power is The Cuban Communist Party, which is made up of only 7% of women. In many cases, women who do have professional jobs are often funded by the Cuban state meaning they only receive about $30 a month. This means that women are employed but do not and cannot hold positions of power due to the men in power who benefit from staying in power. Machismo is mostly ingrained in domestic environments, so while 89% of women over 25 have received a secondary education, if a woman is a doctor, or a lawyer even after all the work she has done during the day, at home she is still expected to cook and clean and be the primary caretaker of the children. Many feminist scholars have described this phenomena, which takes place in other cultures, as the second shift, based on a book by Arlie Russell Hochschild by the same name. Cuban males see no problem in leaving all the housework to their wives while they are allowed to go out for drinks with their friends. Machismo characteristics in men have given them power over women in the home, which leaves certain women more vulnerable to domestic violence committed against them. Cubans are now beginning to leave state employment, to search for jobs in tourism. These jobs produce a great deal of profit because of the wealthy tourists that visit the island and leave good tips. Cubans who were once professors and doctors are now leaving their old jobs to become bartenders and some to even drive cabs, these tourism jobs are primarily held by men; machismo has once again given men more financial power.\n\nFrom the inception of machismo from both the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire, machismo translates to mean \"‘macho’\" and refers to male oppression over women. Moreover, machismo is an all-encompassing term for the dominion of the elite man over ‘the other’. In this case ‘the other’ refers to women of all races and economic status, whom the macho sees as an object to \"protect\" and effeminate and gay men. Men who do not perform their gender in the \"normalized\" way are referred to as \"‘maricon’\", (a derogatory word meaning queer or fag), because their maleness is being called into question. Many of the anti-LGBT acceptance stems from The Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro who had strong views over masculinity and how it fit in his idea of militarism. Fidel Castro once said on homosexuality in a 1965 interview with American journalist Lee Lockwood, \"A deviation of that nature clashes with the concept we have of what a militant communist should be.” That same year gay men in Cuba were being sent to labor camps because their sexuality made them \"un-fit\" to be involved in military service. Machismo has not only been a tool used to restrict the way women should behave but also how men who do not adhere to societal norms, should behave as well. However, in the more recent years, the establishment of CENESEX (National Centre for Sexual Education) has been established so that the population of Cuba can more readily accept sexual diversity of all kinds, especially in terms of the LGBT people. CENESEX has grown in part because of the Cuban government and with the help Mariela Castro-Espin, daughter of Raul Castro, 16th president of Cuba, and niece to Fidel Castro. CENESEX has sought to decrease homophobia in Cuba by increasing sexual awareness by holding social gatherings like anti homophobic rallies.\n\nIn 1975, A new Cuban Law came onto the island. The \"Codigo de la Familia\" (Family Law). It became into effect on March 8, 1975, just 15 years after the Cuban Revolution. The new Family Law of 1975 really helped a lot of women get jobs on the island and provided children with protection under the law so that child begging and homelessness amongst children was practically eradicated. The law also stated that it was required for both sexes to participated in domestic chores But just because the law was passed, does not mean it was heavily reinforced, particularly in the domestic sphere. One of the aspects of the new family law was not only to create equality outside of the home but inside of it as well. This new family law was not received well by many people in Cuba, particularly men who backlashed against the law. These grievances reflected in the media that was made in Cuba, particularly, during the \"Golden Age of Cuban Cinema\".\n\n\"Hasta Cierto Punto directed by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea\" is a movie that follows Oscar, an educated playwright who is currently writing a movie on the effects of machismo in Cuban Society. In the opening scene of this movie, there is an interview with a young black man who is asked about \"machismo.\" The young man laughs and says in the movie, “Oh, they've managed to change my attitudes on that score; I'm certainly changed up to a certain point. I’ve probably changed up to 80% now. Maybe they can work on me and change me to 87%. But they will never, never get me up to 100%, no way!\" These attitudes on screen reflect that of many men in Cuba and their attitudes towards women having more equality in everyday life. The film that Oscar was meant to write for is directed by his friend Arturo. Both are well educated men with stable careers in their fields, wives, cars and other luxuries. However, Arturo believes that the issue of Machismo is most directly a working class problem and that it is up to educated men such as himself and Oscar, to raise consciousness on the issue. Oscar and Arturo use working class dock-workers to use as research for their film. This is where they meet Lina, a working-class woman who is in charge of the dock workers. In the beginning of the film she is represented to be tough on her workers and is well respected amongst all the men she works with. Oscar, the screenwriter, finds himself enamored with her tough attitudes, which is very different than women he has met before. However, as the movie goes on, we see Oscar increasingly find himself frustrated with Lina's free spirit and working-class “down-to-earth” personality. Oscar sees that this is not the kind of woman he is used to. Throughout the movie, although Oscar is having an affair on his wife, he finds himself being more empathetic to working-class struggles in a way that his friend Arturo isn't. Arturo still believes that all working class men are just “macho \"brutes\"” The film's dynamic on working class and bourgeois machismo is very telling of Cuban society and how class reflects on the attitudes towards machismo. It also problematizes, bourgeois men who believe they are intellectually above everyone else, including issues on machismo and women's equality.\n\nMany women identify that machismo is perpetuated through the pressure to raise children a certain way and instill social constructions of gender throughout a child's development. This is complemented by the distant father-son relationship in which intimacy and affection are typically avoided. These aspects set up the environment through which the ideology perpetuates itself. It creates a sense of inferiority that drives boys to reach an unattainable level of masculinity, a pursuit often validated by the aggressive and apathetic behavior they observe in the men around them and ultimately leading them to continue the cycle.\n\nThere is accumulating evidence that supports the relation between the way men are traditionally socialized to be masculine and its harmful mental and physical health consequences. Respectively, \"machismo,\" is sociocultural term associated with male and female socialization in Hispanic cultures; it is a set of values, attitudes and beliefs about masculinity. Although the construct of machismo holds both positive and negative aspects of masculinity, emerging research suggests the gender role conceptualization of machismo has associations with negative cognitive-emotional factors (i.e., depression symptoms; trait anxiety and anger; cynical hostility) among Hispanic populations.\n\nSimilarly, a well-documented disparity notes Latino adolescents reporting higher levels of depression than other ethnic backgrounds. Research suggests this may be associated to adolescent perceived gender role discrepancies which challenge the traditional perceptions of gender role (i.e., machismo).\n\nEnhanced understanding on associations between the gender role conceptualizations of \"machismo\" with negative cognitive-emotional factors may prove invaluable to mental health professionals. According to Fragoso and Kashubeck, \"if a therapist notes that a client seems to endorse high levels of machismo, that therapist might explore whether the client is experiencing high levels of stress and depression\". Therefore, \"conducting a gender role assessment would help a therapist assess a client's level of machismo and whether aspects of gender role conflict are present\".\n\nMany counseling psychologists are interested in further studies for comprehending the connection between counseling for males and topics such as sex-role conflicts and male socialization. This high demand stems from such psychologists' abilities to make patients aware how some inflexible and pre-established ideals regarding sex-roles may be detrimental to people's way of regarding new changes in societal expectancies, fostering relationships, and physical and mental health. Professionals such as Thomas Skovholt, psychology professor at the University of Minnesota, claim that more research needs to be done in order to have efficient mediation for men through counseling.\n\nSeveral elements of \"machismo\" are considered psychologically harmful for men. Competition is a widely talked about subject in this area, as studies show that there are both positive and negative connotations to it. Many benefits arise from healthy competition such as team-building abilities, active engagement, pressure handling, critical thinking, and the strive to excel. As these qualities and traits are highly valued by many, they are widely taught to children from a young age both at school and at home. Scholars also argue that men could be mentally harmed from competition, such as the one experienced by many at their job, as their impetus to rise above their peers and fulfill the breadwinner concept in many societies can cause stress, jealousy, and psychological strain.\n\n\"Machismo as a cultural factor is substantially associated with crime, violence, and lawlessness independently of the structural control variables\" (26-27). One key aspect of Machismo's association to violence is its influence in a man's behavior towards proving his strength (57). While strength and fortitude are recognized as key components to the stereotype of machismo, demonstrations of violence and aggressive actions have become almost expected of men and have been justified as desirable products of being tough and macho. It can be implied that \"if you are violent, you are strong and thus more of a man than those who back down or do not fight\".\n\nViolent encounters can stem from the desire to protect his family, friends, and particularly his female relatives that are vulnerable to the machismo actions of other men, (59). However, through jealousy, competitiveness, and pride, violent encounters are also often pursued to demonstrate his strength to others. A man's insecurities can be fueled by a number of pressures. These range from societal pressures to \"be a man\" to internal pressures of overcoming an inferiority complex, (59). This can translate into actions that devalue feminine characteristics and overemphasize the characteristics of strength and superiority attributed to masculinity, (59).\n\nIn many cases, a man's position of superiority over a female partner can lead him to gain control over different aspects of her life. Since women are viewed as subservient to men in many cultures, men often have power to decide whether his wife can work, study, socialize, participate in the community, or even leave the house. With little opportunity for attaining an income, minimal means to get an education, and the few people they have as a support system, many women become dependent on their husbands financially and emotionally. This leaves many women particularly vulnerable to domestic violence both because it is justified through this belief that men are superior and thus are free to express that superiority and because women cannot leave such an abusive relationship since they rely on their husbands to live.\n\nThe power difference in the relationship between a man and a woman not only creates the social norm of machismo, but by consequence also creates the social concept of marianismo. which is the idea that women are meant to be pure and wholesome. Marianismo derives its origins from Spanish Colonization, as many social constructs from Latin America do. It emphasizes the perfect femininity of a woman and her virginity. One could argue that in the similar manner of Patriarchy, the man is the head of the household while the \"fragile\" woman is submissive and tends to remain behind the scenes. This brings to focus the idea that women are inferior and are thus dependent on their husbands. As a result, they not only rely on their husbands for financial support, but in the social realm are put at the same level as \"children under age 12, mentally ill persons, and spendthrifts\" (265). By way of tradition, not only are women given limited opportunities in what they are able to do and to be, but they are also viewed as people that cannot even take care of themselves. Getting married provides a woman with security under her husband's success, but also entails a lifelong commitment towards serving her husband and her children.\n\nWhile social pressures and expectations play huge roles in the perpetuation of the marianismo construct, this ideology is also taught to girls as they grow up. They learn the importance of performing domestic labor and household chores, such as cooking and cleaning, because this will be the role they will play in their future families. They are taught that these must be done well so that they can adequately serve their families and avoid punishment and discipline by their authoritative husbands.\n\nSome experts hypothesize, since there is a lack of empirical research on gender-role conflicts, that men might suffer from such conflicts because of their fear of femininity.\n\nProfessionals from several universities in the United States developed a model around this hypothesis with six behavioral patterns.\n\n\nThe model was developed around the idea that these six patterns are all influenced by men's the fear of femininity. This theory was then partially supported by a study done by five professionals. Some tools already created to measure gender-role attitudes include the Personal Attitudes Questionnaire, the Bem Sex Role Inventory, the Attitudes Toward Women Scale, and the Attitudes Toward the Male's Role Scale. Evidence suggests that gender-roles conflicts inflicted by \"machismo\" can lead males who were raised with this mentality and or live in a society in which \"machismo\" is prevalent to suffer high levels of anxiety and low self-esteem. Additionally, studies found that many males facing such conflicts are subject to experience anger, depression, and substance abuse.\n\nOne implication of the Machismo concept is the pressure for a man to be sexually experienced. Male infidelity is of common practice in many cultures, as men are not as expected to hold nearly the same level of chastity as women are. Meanwhile, girls are oftentimes brought up to tolerate an unfaithful partner, since it is a part of the machismo culture. As such, this puts populations at risk for transmitting STIs as men seek out multiple sexual partners with little interference from their wives or from society. The risk is further heightened by the lack of condom use by men who are both miseducated about the effectiveness of a condom's protection against STIs and the belief that this wouldn't happen to them. This mentality also deters men from getting themselves tested to know if they are HIV-positive, which leads them to even spread STIs without even knowing it.\n\nFor men in many Latin American countries, their perceived level of masculinity determines the amount of respect they receive in society. Because homosexual men are associated with feminine attributes, they are perceived with lower level of masculinity, and as a result, they receive less respect than heterosexual men in society. This, in turn, can limit their \"ability to achieve upward social mobility, to be taken seriously, or to hold positions of power\". Also, because homosexuality is seen as taboo or even sinful in many Christian denominations, homosexual men tend to lack a support system, leaving many unable express their true sexuality. To deal with such oppression, they must make the choice either to conform to heteronormativity and repress their homosexual identity, to assimilate towards masculine ideals and practices while maintaining their homosexual identity in private, or to openly express their homosexuality and suffer ostracization from society. This creates a hierarchy of homosexuality corresponding to how much \"respect, power, and social standing\" a homosexual man can expect to receive. The more a man acts in accordance with the stereotypical heterosexual hegemonic masculinity, the higher on the social hierarchy they are.\n\nOn the lower end of the hierarchy are the locas or maricones. These men are those that are deemed as effeminate because they do not live by the social construct of hegemonic masculinity and also publicize their homosexuality. As such, they receive little respect both in society in general and among the LGBT community. Many homosexual men resist being associated with the \"loca\" stereotype by either demonstrating overt masculinity or by ridiculing and distancing themselves from other \"loca\" men. A common Puerto Rican saying demonstrates this resistance: \"mejor un drogadicto que un pato\" (better a drug addict than a faggot).\n\nHomosexuality is perceived as negative or weak within the \"machista\" ideal. It doesn't fit into the masculine attributes that \"machismo\" extols. This often leads homosexual or bisexual men living in \"machista\" communities to be reluctant about being open about their sexuality because of the negative connotation associated with it. \"Familismo,\" which is an idea in Latin cultures that ties an individual with a commitment to his or her family, and homophobia can sometimes cause in homosexual individuals the repression of sexual identity, family separation, and to hide their sexuality. Such situations may hinder personal shame and secret sexual actions that increases HIV and STI risk in Latino homosexuals. Regularly experiencing homophobia and low self-esteem have a connection with sexual risk. A survey conducted by the Virginia Commonwealth University found that men who had high \"machismo\" values or characteristics were more than five times more probable to participate in activities or behave in a way to put them at risk for contracting HIV or an STI.\n\nBecause of the negative connotations that come with identifying as homosexual, the definition of homosexuality has become ambiguous. By genderizing sexual practices, only men who are sexually penetrated during sex, locas are considered homosexual while men who are the sexual penetrators during sex can maintain their heterosexual identity. Also, in many Latin American countries, the media portrayal of homosexual men often play into the stereotype of an effeminate, flamboyant male role. As a result, the idea of a masculine homosexual man remains almost unheard of and privatized by the community and by society, which allows this stereotype of homosexual men as locas to persist.\n\nMachismo can also pressure men to defend the well-being of his loved ones, his community, and his country. It allows him to perform altruistic acts in order to provide protection to others. In the past, and even in many current societies where people rely on subsistence agriculture and economy to survive, machismo helped provide men with the courage to drive off potential threats to protect his land and his crop. Today, this contributes to the substantial gender gap in the makeup of military and armed forces around the world, even considering growing female representation in the military today. Beyond the realm of the armed forces, however, the machismo ideology can also drive men to work towards service because he is in a \"superior\" position, which enables him to demonstrate his success by offering his own strengths to help others. Their dependence on him can validate his ego and help maintain this difference in power.\n\nAnother approach to machismo is that of the \"caballerismo\" ideology, that because a man is the head of the household, he is responsible for the well-being of the members of his family. This describes the call for a man to be chivalrous, nurturing, and protective of his loved ones. It translates to the belief that a true man would never act violent towards his wife or children, but would instead ensure that no harm come to them. Machismo, seen through this approach, inspires men to create \"harmonious interpersonal relationships through respect for self and others\". This allows fathers to maintain positive, intimate relationships with his children and share a more egalitarian relationship with his wife.\n\nIn many cultures in the world, there is a long-standing tradition that the man is the head of the household and is responsible for providing for the family. In some cases, this may mean he is the only parent working in paid-work while in other conditions this may mean both parents are working but the man is expected to be the primary income contributor. In either case, part of the masculine identity and his self-respect is defined by his ability to provide for his family. If he is unable to do so, or if he brings home less money than that of his wife, his position as head of the family is challenged. In some cultures, this may mean ultimate shame for him if he cannot fulfill this role: \"that being unable to find work meant that 'there is no recognition even to [his] humanity] ... Those who do not work are like dead people'\" (212). Beyond providing economic support for his family, a man engaging in paid-work is seen as honorable because he is sacrificing time and energy that he could be spending with his family. These are costs that cannot be repaid and thus are an priceless investment on his part towards the well-being of his family unit.\n\nMachismo changes some dynamics of life in a way have both positive and negative effects. For example, machismo grants women authority in the home but at the expense of a man's relationship to his children and work related stress having worked long hours.\n\nIn the traditional household, the man is expected to work and provide for his family while his wife stays home to care for the children. As such, fathers are seen as a distant authority figure to his children while mothers assume the majority of responsibility in this domestic realm and thus gain agency and the ultimate respect of her children. With this female empowerment, decisions in the household can take on a more egalitarian approach, where mothers can have equal say in the household. Meanwhile, the machismo mentality in men as a provider and protector of the family can inspire him to persevere through challenges introduced by work.\n\n\"Within each of our memories there Is the Image of a father who worked long hours, suffered to keep his family alive, united, and who struggled to maintain his dignity. Such a man had little time for concern over his \"masculinity\". Certainly he did not have ten children because of his machismo, but because he was a human being, poor, and without \"access\" to birth control.\"\n\n\"Machismo ideology may be viewed as beneficial to women in that it encourages their husbands to provide for and protect them and their children. Further, by subordinating their needs to those of their family, women earn a lifetime of support from their husbands and children and in this way gain some control in the family\" (90). Because fathers are typically more invested in paid labor, mothers typically spend more time with the children and thus gain credibility in important decisions such as a child's schooling or a child's health care. Nevertheless, in these machist households the fathers will have the last word whenever they choose to, as they are the breadwinners, and all the family ultimately depends on them for survival. In case of a separation or divorce, it is typically the mothers who suffer the most, since they did not invest their time in their career, and will probably still have to provide and care for the children.\n\nDespite machismo's documented history in Hispanic and Latin American communities, research throughout the years has shown a shift in prevalence among younger generations. In Brazil, researchers found that while the majority of young men interviewed held traditional attitudes on gender roles and machismo, there was a small sample of men that did not agree with these views.\n\nAcculturation and education have been proposed to be a factor in how machismo is passed down through Hispanic and Latino generations in the United States. According to researchers who measured self-reported levels of machismo among 72 university students, 37 whom identified as Hispanic, the \"somewhat unique population of college-educated students who have been heavily influence[d] by egalitarian attitudes, values, and norms\" may explain why ethnicity did not directly predict machismo attitudes in two studies. Because education and acculturation of American values in Latino individuals may result in the development of attitudes supporting gender-equality, this demonstrates how machismo may gradually decline over time in the United States.\n\nMoreover, researchers analyzed a large cross-sectional survey among 36 countries, including 6 Latin American countries, from 2009 and discovered countries with less gender inequality had adolescents that supported attitudes of gender-equality, though females were more likely to support non-traditional gender roles than males. While the mean score of gender-equality attitudes was 49.83, with lower scores indicating less gender equality attitudes, Latin American countries scored the following: Chile (51.554), Colombia (49.416), Dominican Republic (43.586), Guatemala (48.890), Mexico (45.596), Paraguay (48.370). Machismo is associated with gender inequality. Therefore, this study suggests that Latino individuals living in their native countries may support more machismo attitudes than Latino immigrants adopting U.S. values of gender equality.\n\nMasuda also studied self-reported measures of sexual relationship power among 40 recently immigrated Latino couples found data against machismo attitudes since women perceived themselves to have greater control and decision-making roles in their relationships. This serves as a stark contrast because machismo traditionally creates a relationship dynamic that relegates women to submissive roles and men to dominant roles. Again, acculturation may play a role in this dynamic shift because the couples averaged about 8 years since immigrating to the United States.\n\nAcculturation has not only been associated with a decline in machismo, it has appeared to affect how it manifests and how it is transferred through generations. Recently, Mexican American adolescents in romantic relationships demonstrated \"adaptive machismo\", which consist of the positive qualities of machismo, such as \"emotional availability, demonstrations of affection, desire to financially care for a female partner, responsibility in child-rearing, and/or to the community or friends\", during conflict resolution scenarios. Furthermore, while Mexican American adolescent males were found to have certain values and attitudes, such as caballerismo, passed down by their families, machismo was not one of them. Because families are not teaching machismo, this implies that it may be learned from sources separate from the family unit, such as peers and the media. Ultimately, these findings suggest that machismo is changing in terms of its prevalence, manifestation, and socialization.\n\nFounded in 1969, the Young Lords were an organization of Puerto Rican revolutionary nationalists in Chicago and New York City. Working toward the liberation of all oppressed people, the Young Lords opposed racism, capitalism, and assimilationist ideologies. Seeking self-determination and community control of institutions and land, the organization's leaders made a distinct choice to denounce machismo in their revised 13-Point Program and Platform. Previously reading, \"We want equality for women. Machismo must be revolutionary... Not oppressive.\", the organization moved toward a more radical position, stating \"We want equality for women. Down with machismo and male chauvinism\". This revised version of the organization's ideological platform was published in their newspaper, \"Palante\" in November 1970 - thirteen months following the original platform's publication in October 1969.\n\nThe Young Lords opposed machismo because, as member Gloria González articulated in her 1971 \"Palante\" editorial, it serves to divide members of their movement. Further, the organization believed machismo serves as an extension of capitalism, a system they opposed. They understood the division of labor, including both reproductive labor and productive labor, to perpetuate the marginalization of women. They also understood the sexual objectification of women to be problematic and damaging to potentially revolutionary leaders. Moving toward this platform, however, would not have been possible without the Women of the Young Lords who pressured the organization's leadership to reject machismo during their East Coast Regional Central Committee retreat in May 1970. At this retreat the group studied and theorized, formally denouncing machismo because if power was to be transferred to the people, it would have to be the hands of all the people; and if this were to be possible, the Young Lords must reject \"attitudes of superiority that brothers had towards sisters\" and the \"passivity of sisters toward brothers (allowing brothers to come out of a macho or chauvinist, superior bag)\".\n\n", "id": "7712849", "categories": ["Latin American culture"], "title": "Machismo"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712905", "text": "Pilot (House)\n\n\"Pilot\", also known as \"Everybody Lies\", is the first episode of the U.S. television series \"House\". The episode premiered on the Fox network on November 16, 2004. It introduces the character of Dr. Gregory House (played by Hugh Laurie)—a maverick antisocial doctor—and his team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. The episode features House's attempts to diagnose a kindergarten teacher after she collapses in class.\n\n\"House\" was created by David Shore, who got the idea for the misanthropic title character from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.\n\nThe episode received generally positive reviews; the character of House was widely noted as a unique aspect of the episode and series, though some reviewers believed that such a cruel character would not be tolerated in real life. Other complaints with the episode included stereotyped supporting characters and an implausible premise. The initial broadcast of \"Pilot\" was watched by approximately seven million viewers, making it the 62nd-most-watched show of the week.\n\nShortly after the start of class, kindergarten teacher Rebecca Adler becomes dysphasic and experiences seizures. Dr. James Wilson attempts to convince Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would be boring. Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic.\n\nAdler's throat closes up during the MRI due to an allergic reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient is a man who is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticizes the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure.\n\nOn House's insistence, neurologist Dr. Eric Foreman and Cameron break into Adler's house to find anything that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of ham in Adler's kitchen and House concludes that she is suffering from neurocysticercosis from eating undercooked pork at some point in her past. Adler refuses to accept more random treatments unless there is conclusive evidence that the diagnosis is correct. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her thigh, House proves that Adler is infested with other tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms.\n\nSeries creator David Shore traced the concept for \"House\" to his background as a patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled that \"I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [for my cluelessness...] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room.\" In 2004, Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched \"House\" to Fox as a medical detective show—a hospital whodunit where the doctors would be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms. The ideas behind House's character were added after Fox bought the show. Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit: he once had to wait two weeks to get a doctor's appointment for a sore hip, by which point his pain had disappeared. Nevertheless, Shore stated that the doctors were \"incredibly polite\". Shore later stated that, as he wrote the pilot, he fell in love with a character who, as a doctor, would actually ask \"Why am I wasting your time?\".\n\nA central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained that he did not want the character to be that young.\n\nThe episode was written by the series creator David Shore, and was shot in Canada; later episodes would be shot on soundstages in California. Shore said that the writings of Berton Roueché, a \"The New Yorker\" staff writer who chronicled intriguing medical cases, inspired the plots for \"Pilot\" and other early episodes.\n\nProducer Bryan Singer originally demanded that an American actor play the role of House; according to Singer, the more foreign actors he watched audition for the part, the more sure he was that an American was needed. At the time of casting, Hugh Laurie was filming the movie \"Flight of the Phoenix\". He put together an audition tape in a Namibian hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a \"bin Laden video\"). Laurie improvised by using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was impressed by Laurie's performance and commented on how well the \"American actor\" grasped the character, not realizing Laurie was British.\n\nLaurie initially believed that House was merely the \"sidekick\" of Wilson, because the script referred to Wilson as a doctor with \"boyish\" looks. Laurie did not realize that House was the protagonist until he read the full teleplay. According to Shore, \"it's easy to make an asshole character unlikable. What's tricky is to make them watchable. And Hugh came in and brought everything that\nwas there to the part, the nastiness, the not politically correct stuff. And yet you wanted to watch him, you wanted to spend time with him.\"\n\nSimilarities between House and the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes appear in the pilot; Shore explained that he was always a fan of Holmes, and found the character's traits of indifference to his clients unique. House and Holmes have only one real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson, especially in terms of chemistry.\n\nRobert Sean Leonard (Dr. James Wilson) read the pilot scripts to \"Numb3rs\" and was planning to audition for the part, but was drawn to auditioning for \"House\" because he enjoyed the role of being \"the guy [the protagonist] counts on\", as well as the similarities to Sherlock Holmes. Leonard felt he did not audition well, and thought his long friendship with Singer helped land him the role. When asked in an interview why his character would ever be friends with House, Leonard replied:\n\nAustralian actor Jesse Spencer's agent suggested that Spencer audition for the role of Chase, but he was hesitant, fearing the show might be similar to \"General Hospital\". Once the actor saw the scripts, he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show \"ER\". Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read the scripts and believed that the show would be either a hit or miss.\n\n\"House\"s premiere episode was generally well received. Critics reacted positively to the character of House; Tom Shales of \"The Washington Post\" called him \"the most electrifying character to hit television in years\". \"The New York Magazine\" called the series \"medical TV at its most satisfying and basic\", and stated that the cast consisted of \"<nowiki>[professional]</nowiki> actors playing doctors who come to care about their patients\", while \"The Boston Globe\"s Matthew Gilbert appreciated that the episode did not sugarcoat the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers' fears about \"HMO factories\". Alessandra Stanley of \"The New York Times\" said that though the characters might be a turn-off to some viewers, the gore and \"derivative gall\" of the show were positives to fans of procedural dramas; \"TV Guide\"s Matt Roush stated \"House\" was an \"uncommon cure for the common medical drama\". Critics of \"The A.V. Club\" called \"House\" the \"nastiest\" black comedy from Fox since the 1996's short-lived television series \"Profit\". Critics considered the series to be a bright spot among Fox's otherwise reality television-based broadcast schedule.\n\nThe episode's format was compared to a rival television series, \"Medical Investigation\". \"USA Today\" favorably stated \"House\" as more character-driven than \"Investigation\"s \"plot-driven procedural\", and the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" felt that \"House\" was the better show due to the title character. \"Variety\"s Brian Lowry, meanwhile, stated that the two shows were too similar and \"House\" was mismatched among Fox's other programs. Other complaints included perceived stereotypes of young, attractive doctors. Sherwin Nuland of \"Slate\" gave the first episodes of the series a highly negative review, stating that \"Of all the medical errata in this series (and there are some whoppers), the greatest is surely the conceit that a physician so remote, so neglectful of duty, so sadistic, so downright cruel as Gregory House would be tolerated in any \nhospital.\" Kay McFadden of \"The Seattle Times\" felt that Laurie's portrayal of House humanized the character, but also revealed the show's deepest flaw: \"a reliance on shallow cuteness for comic relief\". Other complaints included a lack of characterization for the supporting characters in the first few episodes.\n\nThe premiere attracted approximately seven million viewers in the United States, making it the 62nd-most-watched show for the week of November 15–21, 2004. The United Kingdom terrestrial premiere was broadcast on June 9, 2005, by Five and garnered a ten percent share (1.8 million viewers). Christopher Hoag, who composed the music for \"Pilot\" and the first season of \"House\", was nominated in the 2005 Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Music Composition for the episode. Shore received a Humanitas Prize nomination for writing the episode, but lost out to John Wells, who wrote the episode of \"The West Wing\" entitled \"NSF Thurmont\".\n\n", "id": "7712905", "categories": ["House (season 1) episodes", "American television pilots"], "title": "Pilot (House)"}

HPTN studies evaluate new HIV prevention interventions and strategies in populations and geographical regions that bear a disproportionate burden of infection. The HPTN is committed to the highest ethical standards for its clinical trials and recognizes the importance of community engagement in all phases of the research process.\n\nThe HPTN was established in 2000, building on the work of the HIV Network for Prevention Trials (HIVNET). HPTN’s Leadership and Operations Center (LOC) is based at FHI 360, Durham, NC. Its Laboratory Center (LC) is at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD and Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) is housed within the Statistical Center for HIV/AIDS Research and Prevention (SCHARP) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. The HPTN Modelling Centre, part of the SDMC, is a collaboration between the Department of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at Imperial College London, UK, and SCHARP.\n\nHPTN receives funding from three NIH institutes: the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\nThe HPTN is dedicated to the discovery and development of new and innovative research strategies to reduce the acquisition and transmission of HIV.\n\nThe HPTN leadership group is a subset of the Executive Committee (EC). The EC includes investigators from the Clinical Trials Units (CTUs), the Leadership and Operations Center (LOC), the Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC), the Laboratory Center (LC), Community representatives, National Institutes of Health (NIH) representatives, and other individuals with expertise in HPTN scientific research areas.\n\nThe EC, under the direction of HPTN Principal Investigators (PIs) Myron Cohen, MD, and Wafaa El-Sadr, MD, MPH, MPA, in conjunction with the NIH, sets the research priorities of the HPTN and directs its scientific agenda.\n\nThe HPTN is a global network of investigators from Clinical Trials Units (CTUs), Leadership and Operations Center (LOC) which includes recognized experts in HIV prevention, leadership partners from the network Laboratory Center (LC) and Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) and various working groups (WGs) and committees charged with the scientific management and operational support of the network.\n\nThe EC Chair recommends, and the full EC approves, chair(s) and membership of the HPTN committees. Committee members serve for the duration of the cooperative agreement, and chairs serve three-year terms unless otherwise specified. Terms of committee chairs may be extended with the approval of the EC Chair. In addition to the scientific committees and working groups, there are five key standing Network oversight and operations committees: Science Review Committee (SRC), Study Monitoring Committee (SMC), Manuscript Review Committee (MRC), Performance Evaluation Committee (PEC), and Policies and Procedures Group (PPG).\n\nHPTN studies strive to prevent HIV infection through the use of antiretroviral drugs (antiretroviral therapy and pre-exposure prophylaxis); interventions for substance abuse, particularly injection drug use; behavioral risk reduction interventions and structural interventions. \n\nHPTN research studies are developed by protocol teams that include CTU investigators and recognized experts in HIV prevention. As study protocols are developed, they undergo a rigorous intra- and extra-Network review process that ensures compliance with current ethical guidelines and regulatory procedures.\n\nAntiviral Drugs\n\nMonoclonal Antibodies\n\nThe HPTN and the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) are studying monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that may protect people from HIV infection. These studies will guide the development of new ways to prevent HIV. They will also guide future vaccine development that could help to end HIV. \n\n\n\nThe HPTN Scholars Program seeks to provide scholar recipients with the knowledge, skills and connections to further their careers as independent investigators in the HIV prevention research field. Domestic and international scientists from groups under-represented in HIV prevention research are encouraged to apply. Successful domestic investigator applicants will have received their terminal degree (MD, PhD, etc.). For international investigators, current MD, PhD, and MBChB students may apply, along with individuals who already graduated with their terminal degree. \n\nScholars: \n\nScholars are provided funding to cover a portion of their time (typically ~ 10-30%) and expenses including travel and research materials/supplies. Successful applicants will be funded for 18 months, subject to certain restrictions. The HPTN Scholars Program is funded through a supplement from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. \n\nCommunity participation and engagement are critical in the conduct of scientific research. There is mutual benefit to communities and researchers when both parties work together throughout the scientific research process. In the HPTN, community participation occurs throughout the network, community and site levels through various mechanisms that include representation on the Ethics Working Group, the Science Review Committee and protocol teams. \n", "id": "7712928", "categories": ["International medical and health organizations"], "title": "HIV Prevention Trials Network"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712937", "text": "Ethical marketing\n\nEthical marketing refers to the application of marketing ethics into the marketing process. Briefly, marketing ethics refers to the philosophical examination, from a moral standpoint, of particular marketing issues that are matters of moral judgment. Ethical marketing generally results in a more socially responsible and culturally sensitive business community. The establishment of marketing ethics has the potential to benefit society as a whole, both in the short- and long-term. Ethical marketing should be part of business ethics in the sense that marketing forms a significant part of any business model. Study of Ethical marketing should be included in applied ethics and involves examination of whether or not an honest and factual representation of a product or service has been delivered in a framework of cultural and social values.\n\nIt promotes qualitative benefits to its customers, which other similar companies, products or services fail to recognise. The concern with ethical issues, such as child labor, working conditions, relationships with third world countries and environmental problems, has changed the attitude of the Western World towards a more socially responsible way of thinking. This has influenced companies and their response is to market their products in a more socially responsible way.\n\nThe increasing trend of fair trade is an example of the impact of ethical marketing. In the 'Ethical Shoppers Price Index Survey' (2009), fair trade was the most popular ethical badge products could have. It also revealed that many consumers distrusted green claims. (The idea of fair trade is that consumers pay a guaranteed commodity price to a small group of producers, the producers agree to pay fair labor prices and conserve the environment - a fair deal for everyone.)\n\nThe philosophy of marketing is not lost with this newfound ethical slant, but rather hopes to win customer loyalty by reinforcing the positive values of the brand, creating a strong citizen brand. However, this new way of thinking does create new challenges for the marketer of the 21st century, in terms of invention and development of products to add long-term benefits without reducing the product's desirable qualities.\n\nMany brands have tried to use ethics to make themselves look responsible, often spinning environmental claims which has led to the term greenwash (see greenwashing) In research consumers have shown to have even less trust of ethical claims in ads than ordinary ads. media attention on ethics has resulted in many top brands suffering consumer boycotts. Although many brands have tried to use green issues, it has been noted that in research 2/3 of consumers responded more to ethical claims that relate to people rather than to than environment.\n\nEthical marketing should not be confused with government regulations brought into force to improve consumer welfare, such as reducing sulfur dioxide emissions to improve the quality of the air. A government regulation is a legal remedy intended to mitigate or correct an ethical issue, such as pollution of the air that we all share. Enlightened ethical marketing is at work when the company and marketer recognize further improvements for humankind unrelated to those enforced by governments or public opinion. By way of example, the Coop Group refuses to invest money in tobacco, fur and any countries with oppressive regimes.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7712937", "categories": ["Types of marketing"], "title": "Ethical marketing"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712939", "text": "Puerto Rican Volunteers Corps\n\nThe Puerto Rican Volunteers Corps (\"Instituto de Voluntarios de Puerto Rico\" in Spanish) was a militia composed of private citizens, principally instituted for the defense of Puerto Rico's periphery from pirate incursions and foreign invasion. In principle, the volunteers were characterized by their unwavering loyalty to the Spanish Crown and Empire, and as such were subject to compulsory membership in the \"Partido Incondicionalmente Español\" (The Spanish Unconditional Party). However, upon its creation in 1812 the \"Partido Incondicional\" was exclusive to all but peninsular-born Spaniards (peninsulares), and it was only towards the second half of the century that its rolls were opened to insular-born subjects of European descent (criollos).\n\nThe Volunteer Corps did not fight as a group during the Spanish–American War of 1898, nor did the majority of its approx. 8,000 members assist the regular Spanish Army in its \"pro forma\" defense of the island. The Corps's conduct during the war was not due to rank rebellion but rather to recalcitrance: a low \"esprit de corps\" followed the Governor General of Puerto Rico's order to have all Volunteers integrated into the Regular Army without regard to any official rank or distinction they might have held in the Corps. Volunteers, by then consisting largely of the island's mercantile and hacendado elite (e.g., Manuel Egozcue Cintrón, Rafael Janer y Soler, Francisco J. Marxuach, Pompeyo Oliu y Marxuach, Narciso Vall-Llovera Feliu), recoiled at the perceived \"injustice\" and \"indignity\" of having to fight alongside men recruited from the lowest rungs of Spanish colonial society. Other—though perhaps less quantifiable—factors contributing to Volunteer inaction were the signal winds of change sweeping over the remnants of Spain's once vast imperial possessions; the Cortes's belated attempts at establishing an autonomist insular government in 1897; Spain's bloody and ineffectual efforts at ending the Ten Years' War; and the U.S.'s undisguised expansionist aims, combined with the contagion of assimilationist and insurrectionist groups operating from within the island and outwards from the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, by the time of the US invasion of the island on July 25, 1898, the Voluntarios and indeed most everyone else in Puerto Rico, was well aware that Spain's land and naval forces had surrendered in Cuba and that Admiral Montijo's fleet in the Philippines had been virtually destroyed. Moreover, it was quite evident that Spain's regular army was not putting up much of a fight for Puerto Rico. Accordingly, the Voluntarios (with few exceptions) were not willing to risk injury or death in a war that was in effect, lost. New York's Seventh Volunteer Infantry Regiment also refused to enter the fray. Reportedly, they did not want to serve under regular army officers, particularly those who had graduated from West Point.\n\nIn 1898 they were up by a Commanding Officer and staff consists of a commander, three captains, two first lieutenants, four deputies, a doctor and a pharmacist. His active force was formed by 14 infantry battalions and the company on the island of Vieques.\n\nList of battalions in 1897:\n\n\n", "id": "7712939", "categories": ["Military in Puerto Rico", "Military history of Puerto Rico"], "title": "Puerto Rican Volunteers Corps"}

The station played primarily orchestral recordings and was known for avoiding chamber music. Unlike its sister station in Los Angeles, KFAC, KKHI tended to play longer selections and never excerpts from symphonies or concertos. The various daily programs each had a specific musical introduction; one of the evening programs, for example, was introduced by the opening bars of the third movement of the second symphony of Sergei Rachmaninov. One notable fact was KKHI's monthly playing of the \"Variations on a Theme by Tchaikovsky\" by Anton Arensky.\n\nThe AM signal of KKHI began on March 17, 1947, as KSMO in San Mateo, California. It was owned and operated by the Amphlett Printing Company, the owner and publisher of the daily \"San Mateo Times\". The station's three directional transmitter towers were built in Belmont, California, next to the brand-new Bayshore Freeway (U.S. Highway 101). KSMO's programming was primarily classical recordings with some coverage of San Mateo High School athletic games.\n\nIn 1952, Amphlett sold the station and it became known as KEAR. The station's call letters were changed again in the mid-1950s to KOBY, and the station became a popular early outlet for Top 40 rock music. Gordon McLendon bought the station in 1960 and changed its call letters to KQBY, with a \"good music station\" format (typically a classical hour, 8-9 or 8-10 PM, with smooth instrumentals, show tunes, etc. outside those hours) (c.f. San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco Chronicle, and San Francisco News-Call Bulletin radio logs). The station had been owned by Sherwood R. Gordon. He sold the station when a contract dispute with the union representing station engineers could not be resolved. McLendon also owned KABL in Oakland, with a format similar to KQBY.\n\nFinally, in 1963, the station became KKHI and was joined with its FM counterpart; within a year it switched back to classical music.\n\nKKHI-FM, which also began broadcasting in 1947, was first known as KGSF. The Warner Brothers of Oakland, owners of KWBR, launched the station in San Francisco. There were several ownership changes and call letter changes: KXKX and KEAR-FM. Fred Krock joined KXKX as an announcer in 1953; he would later become a major contributor at KKHI. \nKKHI quickly arranged to broadcast many of the Friday evening concerts of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, usually when it was conducted by music director Josef Krips (1902-1974), in stereo from the War Memorial Opera House. Since Krips refused to make recordings with the San Francisco orchestra, the KKHI broadcasts were the only mass media outlet for the concerts. The broadcasts continued in 1970 when Seiji Ozawa (1935-) became the orchestra's music director. In the summer of 1973, when the orchestra toured Europe, KKHI made history by broadcasting a Paris concert in stereo via satellite. San Francisco Symphony broadcasts moved to KQED-FM in the early 1980s and were eventually nationally syndicated.\n\nKrock became chief engineer at KKHI in 1966. He was also the host for the afternoon commute programming and had major responsibilities for the San Francisco Symphony broadcasts. His resonant voice became a fixture at the station. Krock would eventually leave KKHI and become engineering supervisor at KQED-FM in 1980.\n\nBy the late 1960s, longtime KNBR disc jockey Doug Pledger had moved to KKHI, hosting a long-running Saturday afternoon program devoted to light classics. Pledger was particularly fond of recordings by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra, as well as selections from operettas. For that matter, KKHI's popular announcer Bill Agee hosted another long-running weekend program called \"Gilbert & Sullivan & Me,\" which showcased one of the operettas by the famous British duo, complete with a running commentary on the storyline; the program began with the opening strains of the overture to \"HMS Pinafore\".\n\nBeginning in 1971, KKHI also broadcast Friday evening performances of the San Francisco Opera. For a number of years actor/writer Scott Beach hosted these broadcasts, which were offered in stereo with special encoding for those able to receive matrix quadraphonic signals. Like the famed Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts, also carried on KKHI, there were regular intermission features, including interviews with the conductors and singers in each opera. These broadcasts continued until 1979.\n\nA regular feature on KKHI was a daily musical quiz program, \"Telemusic Quiz,\" hosted by Bill Agee. Listeners would call in answers to the questions and, if they had the right answer, they would win tickets to various concerts. Agee hosted the San Francisco Symphony broadcasts and made regular appearances at the summer concerts held in San Francisco's Stern Grove.\n\nThe station operated 24 hours a day, and its AM signal, transmitted from Belmont, California, with 10,000 watts of power, could be received over much of the western United States and Canada at night. The FM transmitter was located on San Bruno Mountain. \n\nThe KKHI call letters were later used by a Smooth Jazz Station in Denver, Colorado, from June 9, 2008, to August 31, 2010.\n\nLabor disputes, along with declining advertising support, eventually brought an end to the classical music programming. The station was sold in 1994 to Westinghouse and its format was dramatically changed. Now it was known as KPIX-FM and AM. The AM/FM simulcasts ended in 1997, when Westinghouse sold KPIX-FM to Bonneville International, which changed the call letters to KZQZ. The AM station is now known as KGMZ. The FM station is now known as KGMZ-FM.\n\nThe KKHI call letters were revived in 1994 on what had been KTIM-FM and AM in San Rafael, California. The attempt to revive KKHI's classical music programming ultimately proved unsuccessful.\n\nThe Bay Area's main classical music outlet today is KDFC in San Francisco, California, a station that broadcasts on FM only. For many years there were daytime simulcasts on KIBE, a 5,000-watt station on 1220 AM in Palo Alto, California. In the early 1960's, the zenith of classical radio broadcasting in the Bay Area, six stations broadcast this format! (KDFC 102.1 / KIBE 1220 simulcast, KSFR 94.9, KKHI 95.7 / 1550, and KBRG, 105.3 (c.f.

The magazine was published monthly from 1959 to 1961 then bi-monthly until November 1972. Charles Tepfer was the first editor and Robert Beason was the editor for rest of the magazine's run (1961 -1972). The headquarters was in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nZiff-Davis success with \"Popular Electronics\" magazine showed there was a market for electronics hobbyist magazines and the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 had increased the public's interest in science and technology. \"Electronics Illustrated\" (EI) was targeted for this hobbyist and do-it-yourself audience.\n\nThe cover of the second issue had a rocket built in a basement workshop. To promote amateur rocketry the U.S. Army began a series titled \"Build a Safe Model Missile.\" Model rockets appeared on the covers and in articles for several years. The space race between the United States and the Soviet Union led many hobbyists into amateur rocketry. In the late 1960s Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) was formed to sell instrumentation to rocket hobbyist. They were unsuccessful at that venture but later created the Altair 8800 computer kit that sparked the home computer revolution.\n\nThe construction projects in \"Electronics Illustrated\" were assembled and checked by the editors. The articles had numerous photos and always included a wiring diagram in addition to the schematic. The projects were not as complex as those in other magazine but they appealed to the beginner. The magazine also had introductory theory articles in every issue.\n\nRadio was another focus of the magazine with many articles on Citizens Band (CB), Amateur Radio and Short Wave Listening (SWL)\n\nRobert Hertzberg began an amateur radio column, The Ham Shack, in April 1961. Hertzberg got his license in 1919 and had been writing about amateur radio ever since. The column was taken over by Wayne Greene, the publisher of 73 magazine, as early as 1970.\n\nIn the final years of magazine, Tom Kneitel wrote a column in \"Electronics Illustrated\" that was similar to Tom McCahill column in Mechanix Illustrated.\nFawcett discontinued \"Electronics Illustrated\" with the November 1972 issue and some of the content was continued in \"Mechanix Illustrated\". The circulation was 300,000 but Fawcett claimed there was a shrinking market for electronics magazines and they wanted to focus on the larger \"Mechanix Illustrated\" audience of 1.5 million readers. This followed Ziff-Davis's merger of \"Electronics World\" with \"Popular Electronics\" in January 1972.\n", "id": "7712975", "categories": ["Magazines established in 1958", "Hobby magazines", "American science and technology magazines", "Magazines disestablished in 1972", "Amateur radio magazines", "American bimonthly magazines", "Defunct magazines of the United States"], "title": "Electronics Illustrated"}

Aired on November 13, 2006, it was the second of the four episodes to be aired during the November sweeps in the United States. The episode was written by Monica Macer and Seth Hoffman, and directed by Greg Yaitanes, who directed \"Brother's Keeper\".\n\nRockmond Dunbar (who plays Benjamin Miles \"C-Note\" Franklin) was the only regular cast member who did not appear in this episode. The episode title refers to the coded location of the rendezvous between the protagonist Michael Scofield and a people-smuggler. The events in this episode take place on June 4 as indicated by Michael in \"Buried\".\n\nT-Bag (Robert Knepper) escapes Susan Hollander's house in Tribune, Kansas by severing his reattached hand, narrowly escaping apprehension by the Tribune police. He then proceeds to use his GPS device to track the location of Charles Westmoreland's money and finds it in Geary's possession. Geary (Matt DeCaro) is at an expensive hotel suite when three call girls arrive. When his indecent proposal costs him seven hundred fifty dollars, Geary reaches into the bag of money and notices the GPS tracking device. Before he can react, a more than usually disheveled T-Bag arrives and tells the call girls to leave. He threatens a frightened Geary with a champagne bottle as Geary suggests splitting the money, saying \"Come on T, we can deal\". T-Bag appears to disagree. The second-to-next scene shows T-Bag drinking champagne and going through the backpack, where he finds cigarettes and what appears to be a receipt, while studying this he gets a cunning look. The song playing in this scene is \"The Only Hell My Mama Ever Raised\" by Johnny Paycheck.\n\nIn the meantime, Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) is at a Tribune hospital talking to Detective Slattery (Romy Rosemont), telling her that a black male in his early twenties attacked him at the bus station. Slattery finds holes in Bellick's story; when she leaves the room, Bellick threatens Roy Geary on his voice mail. As Bellick leaves the hospital, he sees Geary dead on a gurney, admits that they were friends, and Slattery tells Bellick she needs to ask him more questions.\n\nIn Maljamar, New Mexico, Michael (Wentworth Miller) buys some supplies, but steals a GPS device. The elderly shopkeeper tries to stop Michael but is overpowered by him, and Michael escapes with the GPS. This is a catalyst for Michael, who realises what he is becoming. A montage of all the wrongs committed for the sake of the escape appears strongly in his memory, prompting him to go to a confessional to confess his sins. He vaguely describes his sins to the priest, and also explains that as a child, he saw a man bleed to death and was glad for it.\n\nMichael then hitchhikes to Country Road 17 and uses his GPS to find the location of Bolshoi Booze. While waiting at the location, the Coyote (people smuggler) arrives with two associates in a blue Ford pickup. In exchange for the escape plane, Michael was to give a box of medical nitroglycerin as promised. However, when the \"nitro\" is tested, it is discovered to be sugar water. The real nitroglycerin Michael had prepared to bring was already confiscated by the F.B.I. in episode \"Unearthed\".\n\nThe head Coyote (Jose Zuniga) and his two men threaten to kill Michael but Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco) suddenly appears and rescues Michael, shooting the ringleader in the shoulder. They tie up Michael's would be killers. Aware of the fact that the ringleader may die from his wound without medical attention, Michael, with his confession fresh on his mind, lets the men go, and discovers the true location of the plane - \"The seven mile marker at Route 4\". The ringleader further says that \"It's going to stop for five minutes. Then it's going to go to Oaxaca, Mexico.\"\n\nIn the safe house at Trinidad, Colorado, Aldo Burrows (Anthony Denison) explains to his son Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and his grandson L. J. Burrows (Marshall Allman) about the nature of the conspiracy. He explains how President Caroline Reynolds is serving The Company. He also says that an NSA analyst acquired a conversation between Reynolds and Terrence Steadman two weeks after Steadman's purported death. Although the analyst was apprehended, a digital copy of the conversation was sent to Sara Tancredi's father, Governor Frank Tancredi (John Heard). Aldo says of Sara (Sarah Wayne Callies), \"She's the key to this whole thing, Lincoln.\"\n\nAgent Kim's operative kills two of Aldo's men, and attempts to kill Lincoln as well. Lincoln rushes and stabs the operative, and Jane (Kristin Lehman) shoots the latter dead. The operative's mobile phone rings, and despite Aldo's warning, Lincoln answers the call. He threatens Agent Kim (Reggie Lee), who replies, \"You don't even know who I am.\"\n\nLincoln and LJ part ways; LJ goes with Jane to safety, while Aldo and Lincoln head to Bolshoi Booze to meet Michael. Michael, Sucre, and Lincoln meet. When Michael sees Aldo, he recognizes him.\n\nAgent Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein) binds and gags Sara in a Gila, New Mexico motel room. Kellerman explains to Sara that he is not Lance, he is not an addict, and proceeds to interrogate her regarding the item her father took from Washington, DC. When Sara repeatedly denies knowledge of it, Kellerman tortures her by dunking her in a filled bathtub. When he still cannot get the information, Kellerman dons rubber gloves, dumps a working iron into the bathtub and dunking Sara again to add an electrocution effect to the torture routine. Agent Kim later calls Kellerman and orders him to kill Sara. After considering the matter and Sara's refusal to give in, Kellerman dunks her into the water and holds her down.\n\nAgent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) is still in the factory near Gila when Agent Kim arrives to open the gate. He explains to Mahone that once Burrows crosses the border, he is of no use to The Company. Mahone roughs up Kim when he appears to threaten his son, Cameron.\n\nLosing a desperate battle to discover the meaning of Bolshoi Booze, Mahone tries to call his wife Pam (Callie Thorne), but she does not pick up the phone. Upon re-examining the photograph of the tattoo, Mahone realizes that Bolshoi Booze upside down are geographical coordinates, located at . Agent Wheeler tells Mahone the exact location of the coordinates, and Mahone hangs up on him. Wheeler tells the other agents, \"He's keeping us out of the loop.\"\n\nPam calls Mahone back. Mahone tells Pam that he would do things differently if he had a chance to change the way events transpired between them. Pam offers to pick him up, but Mahone tells Pam he loves her and hangs up.\n\nThe character, Aldo Burrows, reveals in the episode that the incriminating conversation between (now President) Reynolds and her brother happened a few months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Since the events of the show begin three years after Steadman's \"death\", this would place the show in the year of 2005. This was later confirmed in the episode, \"Wash\".\n\nThis episode improved in viewer ratings and critical responses from earlier episodes. The episode attained 9.15 million viewers with 5.8% household rating and 9% household share for the Fox network on November 13, 2006, placing the network in third place behind CBS and NBC for the night. Although one reviewer from the \"Arizona Daily Star\" commented that the writers of the show had \"squandered what could have been one of the most dramatic arcs of the series\", the critic from \"IGN\" commended the episode for the \"clever plot twists and a few character defining moments\". Furthermore, the critic added, \"'Bolshoi Booze' provides fans with a breathless foray of excitement and ingenuity.\" The episode received an overall rating of 9.5/10 from IGN. From \"TV Fodder\", the reviewer gave a positive criticism for the episode and stated that it was among the top three episodes of the second season, along with the \"Manhunt\" and \"Scan\" episodes. There were further praises for the episode's \"emotional struggles, double and triple crosses, last minute rescues\" and \"cliff-hanger of the type we all expect from this show\". Similarly, a critic from \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" gave the episode a grade A. He also commented on the number of deaths on \"Prison Break\" and cannot see a \"realistic way of [Sara] getting out of that situation\" but commends the show for having the courage to suggest the death of a major character.\n\n", "id": "7712996", "categories": ["Prison Break episodes"], "title": "Bolshoi Booze"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7713001", "text": "Ryan Moore (jockey)\n\nRyan Lee Moore (born 18 September 1983) is an English flat racing jockey, who was Champion Jockey in 2006, 2008 and 2009. He is currently the first choice jockey for Aidan O'Brien's Ballydoyle operation, a role in which he mainly rides horses owned by Coolmore Stud. He also sometimes rides horses for Juddmonte and The Queen.\n\nMoore is the son of successful trainer and former jump jockey Gary L. Moore, and brother to jump jockeys Jamie Moore and Joshua Moore, and top amateur jockey Hayley Moore. \n\nHe is the grandson of trainer Charlie Moore, a well-known character who lived around the corner from Brighton Racecourse. Charlie was also a second-hand car salesman, and many stories have circulated about his dual career, including how he swapped three truck tyres in exchange for a filly, and how he started training when he accidentally bought a horse by raising his hand at auction. He is also close to Gary's sister, his aunt Candy, who is also a jockey.\n\nRyan considers himself the laziest of the family.\n\nMoore starting riding at four, having lessons at his grandad's and with the pony club. However, he didn't enjoy cross country and showjumping, finding it a \"bit tame\" when he wanted to be doing competitive racing instead. National Hunt jockey AP McCoy rode for Moore's father when in his teens and Moore, aged 12, led him over hurdles as they schooled horses. Moore was influenced by his drive and dedication. \"He wanted to ride everything in the yard. His work ethic was huge,\" he told an interviewer.\n\nUnlike his siblings, who knew from an early age that they wanted to race, this wasn't always clear to Moore. Football was another passion, and he had trials with Brighton and Hove Albion.\n\nMoore's first wins came as a 16-year-old, which is when he decided to take up racing as a career, although his mother Jayne tried to persuade him to stay at school and complete his A-levels believing he wouldn't make it in racing. At one point, he too did not consider himself good enough. During his A-levels, he was taking days off to ride, but this only lasted one term before he gave up. \n\nMoore rode winners for his grandad before the latter died in 2000. \"I was close to him and won a couple of races before he died in 2000. I like to think it made him happy, that it brought him something at the end of his life. I'm glad he saw it.\" At 16, he weighed 8st 10lb, but by the time he became champion apprentice he had to get down to 7st 13lb.\n\nMoore's first mentor was Richard Hannon, a trainer for whom he would still be winning big races when Hannon retired in 2013. He was sent to Hannon by his father. At the end of his first full season, he won the Cesarewitch Handicap and had Group race experience.\n\nHis first major victory came for a different trainer, though, when he won the 2002 Cesarewitch Handicap for Martin Pipe on Miss Fara on 19 October 2002. He got his first black type victory later that same year when winning the Listed Jebel Ali Stakes in the United Arab Emirates shortly after Christmas 2002. He didn't score any major victories in 2003, and had a strike rate of under 10%, but it was enough for him to become Champion Apprentice.\n\n2004 saw him top 100 winners and £1 million in prize money for the first time and on 29 August, he won his first group race, the Group 3 Prestige Stakes at Goodwood. For Hannon, he then won his first Group 2 race, taking the Mill Reef Stakes on Galleota in September.\n\nIncreasingly, Moore rode for Sir Michael Stoute, sharing those duties with Kerrin McEvoy, Mick Kinane and others after Kieren Fallon quit as stable jockey to ride for Aidan O'Brien. It was for Stoute he had his first Group 1 win, on Notnowcato in the Juddmonte International at York in August 2006. That year he won his first jockeys' title which came as a surprise to him. He had said that the odds of 8/1 on him becoming champion at the start of the season were too generous, but he had expected to finish third. Commentators were suggesting that his \"resilience and iron will should turn Moore into one of racing's iconic figures.\" \nIn 2006, he was riding at 8st 5lb most days.\n\nIn 2007, he rode Notnowcato to victory in the Tattersalls Gold Cup in Ireland, and in the Eclipse. For the latter race, Moore took the horse down the stands side, while the remainder of the field including odds-on favourite and Derby winner Authorized and George Washington. \n\nIn that year, Stoute horses gave him 47 of his 126 wins, overtaking Hannon (33 winners) as his primary stable. Moore spent three months injured during the season, preventing him from retaining his title, but a late season crop of victories meant he still finished third in the jockeys table.\n\nThese efforts were rewarded when he was offered the job as stable jockey at the end of the 2007 season, while he was in Tokyo, riding Papal Bull in the Japan Cup. Hannon meanwhile would make more use of his son-in-law Richard Hughes (jockey), after his retainer with Khaled Abdullah came to an end. Moore would later say of Stoute, \"he's just a very clever man - an unbelievable brain.\"\nOn the Thursday of Glorious Goodwood in 2007, Moore won four races, including the Goodwood Cup on Allegretto.\n\nIn April 2009, he rode winners at Sandown Park, Sha Tin in Hong Kong, and Windsor on consecutive days, the 36 hour trip to the Far East winning him nearly £50,000 after he won the Queen Elizabeth II Cup on Presvis, trained by Luca Cumani. That summer, he won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes on Conduit for Stoute. The first three, all trained by Stoute, came together, leading to a steward's inquiry, but Conduit kept the result.\n\nOver the course of 2009 and 2010, he swept the big races of the world. He won at the Breeders' Cup in the autumn after sealing a third jockeys' title. Then he won the 2010 Derby on Workforce in a course record time, and the Oaks on consecutive days. He crowned the year with another win on Workforce in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. A broken wrist cost him another chance at the jockeys' title, but he was already being spoken of as an all-time great by some commentators. Former jockey Willie Carson suggested he could be as good as Lester Piggott and predicted he would recapture the jockeys' title in 2011.\nHowever, his attention was beginning to shift from pursuing the title, to concentrating on fewer, bigger races instead. He clarified that with a family, he was no longer keen to travel the country in pursuit of another title. \"The big races are becoming a massive draw for me. That's the way it has happened with a lot of top jockeys... I understand why Frankie [Dettori] competes in fewer races. It's understandable, with our schedule.\" His chances of winning the title took a blow in any case, when he missed two months after injuring himself at Goodwood in July. \n\nHe was now riding for several celebrity owners. He rode for many of the Manchester United team including Michael Owen, Paul Scholes, Ashley Cole and manager Alex Ferguson. Moore also rode the Queen's Carlton House to victory in the Dante Stakes at York Racecourse and then to a close 3rd in the Epsom Derby. He finished 2011 by winning a Japanese Grade One on Snow Fairy for the second year running.\n\nO'Brien was rumoured to be lining up Moore as stable jockey from November 2011. Moore had already won in big races for O'Brien while retained by Stoute, including at the Breeders' Cup and Royal Ascot. Stoute's stable had seen a downturn in fortunes, while O'Brien had provided Moore with big winners. O'Brien also had the ante-post favourites for the next season's Classics.\n\nMoore was keen on the job, but reluctant to move his family from Newmarket to County Tipperary. They negotiated a compromise that allowed Moore to live in England, while riding for O'Brien in Ireland at the major meetings.\n\nInstead, O'Brien's son Joseph became the main rider for Ballydoyle. Moore rode for O'Brien when the trainer had multiple runners. In that way he won the 2012 1,000 Guineas on Homecoming Queen and the 2013 Derby on Ruler Of The World.\nHe finished fourth in the jockeys' championship of 2012, and runner-up in 2013, behind Richard Hughes.\nHe again finished runner-up in the jockeys' championship of 2014.\n\nBy 2015, Joseph O'Brien, at nearly 6ft tall, was struggling to make the weight to ride in the major races and his father Aidan needed a replacement. In April, it was confirmed that Moore would ride Ballydoyle's runners in the Classics and other significant races. O'Brien explained the arrangement thus: \"Ryan will be riding our main horses this year and Joseph will be riding other horses when the weights allow him to. Seamie Heffernan and Colm O’Donoghue will also be involved as in the past.\"\n\nBy the end of the 2017 season, Moore had won over 2,000 races in Britain, the third most of all active jockeys, behind only Frankie Dettori and Joe Fanning, both of whom had been riding for a decade longer.\n\nFlat wins in Great Britain by year\n\n Great Britain\n Australia\n Canada\n France\n Germany\n Hong Kong\n Ireland\n Italy\n Japan\n United Arab Emirates\n United States\n\n\n", "id": "7713001", "categories": ["British Champion flat jockeys", "English jockeys", "Lester Award winners", "Living people", "1983 births", "Sportspeople from Brighton"], "title": "Ryan Moore (jockey)"}

She was by Octagon, out of the English-bred Bella Donna (by The Derby winner Hermit). Named Beldame, she was a homebred of August Belmont Jr.'s (after whose family the Belmont Stakes as well as Belmont Park were named), and though Belmont Jr. continued to own her, he leased her as a two- and three-year-old to a business associate named Newton Bennington. Although she won two races before going to Bennington, it was while racing for him that Beldame began her great career, earning her place as number 98 in the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century.\n\nAs a two-year-old, Beldame won the Great Filly Stakes at Sheepshead Bay Race Track and the Vernal Stakes (wiring the field).\n\nWhen Beldame was three, she won twelve of her fourteen starts, earning the championship of her division. Her only losses came against older males. That year, she took the Alabama Stakes, the Gazelle Handicap (by ten lengths on a sloppy track), the Carter Handicap (against males by over two lengths under a stout hold), the Ladies Stakes, the Saratoga Cup (beating the year-older Belmont Stakes winner and Champion Three-Year-Colt, Africander), the First Special, the Second Special, the Dolphin Sakes, the Mermaid Stakes (winning by seven lengths and drawing away from the field even as she was being eased up), and the September Stakes.\n\nIn the Ladies Stakes, Beldame got loose under her substitute rider before the race and galloped all over the track looking for an opening to run back to the barn. She found it before her jockey, Gene Hildebrand, got her under control. She returned to the track minutes later, wired the race, and won easily.\n\nDue to her success, track officials weighted Beldame so heavily she won only twice at the age of four. That year, she won the Standard Handicap, and then, carrying more weight than the males, she won the Suburban Handicap, beating Broomstick by five lengths.\n\nBeldame retired with 17 wins, 6 places, and 4 shows from 31 starts. Her earnings amounted to $102,570. Following Firenze and Miss Woodford, she was the third filly to win more than $100,000. Her usual rider was Hall of Famer Frank O'Neill. Her first trainer, when she was campaigned by Belmont, was Hall of Famer John Hyland. While she was leased to Bennington, Hall of Famer Fred Burlew trained her.\n\nAfter Beldame's retirement, Belmont took her to the re-creation of his father's Nursery Stud, the original farm being dispersed after August Belmont's death.\n\nIn a poll among members of the American Trainers Association conducted in 1955 by Delaware Park Racetrack, Beldame was voted the seventh greatest filly in American racing history. Gallorette was voted first.\n\nBeldame, who died in 1924, was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1956.\n\n", "id": "7713035", "categories": ["1901 racehorse births", "Racehorses trained in the United States", "Racehorses bred in Kentucky", "United States Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees", "1923 racehorse deaths", "Belmont family"], "title": "Beldame"}

In the winter of 1949–50 she was part of \"Operation Frostbite\", a cold weather exercise near the Davis Strait, subsequently to sail from Newport on 4 January 1950 for another \"Med\" cruise.\n\nUpon return to the United States, she made a series of reserve training cruises along the eastern, seaboard and engaged in type training along the New England coast and into the Caribbean Sea. Underway from Newport on 8 January 1951, she embarked on another \"Med\" cruise, returning to Boston in May for overhaul followed by refresher training out of Cuba.\n\n\"Glennon\" spent January and February 1952 with a carrier task force conducting cold weather training in waters ranging northward to the Davis Straits. From April to October she was flagship of Destroyer Squadron 8 (DesRon 8), and stood out in June for the Mediterranean, returning to Annapolis, Maryland in September 1952. In July and August 1952 'Glennon' was part of a Task Group with the flagship New Jersey which conducted Midshipman training on a six-week cruise. The Task Group shipped out of Newport News, VA with ports of call at Cherbourg, Lisbon, and Guantanamo. For more than a decade the destroyer continued her already established peacetime operation pattern. Highlights of this exacting duty included participation as a recovery station ship in the 1961 and 1962 Project Mercury flights, and in the search for the lost nuclear powered submarine . In August 1961 \"Glennon\" was called away suddenly to join the task force for the Project Mercury space shot carrying Major Gus Grissom. In early 1962 she was again chosen to man an Atlantic recovery station for the historic three-orbit flight of Major John Glenn.\n\nAn extensive overhaul at Boston terminated on 24 July 1963, and through the remainder of that year \"Glennon\" trained in the Caribbean, acted as school ship for the Anti-submarine Warfare School at Key West, Florida, and put in at Boston in November for refitting. The years 1964 and 1965 found \"Glennon\" continuing her ASW work. In September 1964 she was chosen to carry guests to the America's Cup Races. Later in May 1965 she conducted exercises called \"Mule 65\" in which United States Army cadets from West Point were given shipboard indoctrination. Through 1967 \"Glennon\" continued to operate with the United States Atlantic Fleet.\n\nGlennon was called to serve with TF77 as a Naval Gunfire Support Unit off Viet Nam in 1972. She made a 72-hour notice emergency deployment from Charleston South Carolina through the Panama Canal. She supported many operations and answered many calls for fire in South Viet Nam and around the DMZ. She also supported operations off North Viet Nam, and was involved in several fire fights with shore batteries. Her Officers and crew wear the Combat Action Ribbon, multiple awards.\n\"Glennon\" was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1976. She was sunk as a target off Puerto Rico on 26 February 1981.\n", "id": "7713053", "categories": ["1945 ships", "Shipwrecks of the Puerto Rico coast", "Vietnam War destroyers of the United States", "Ships sunk as targets", "Maritime incidents in 1981", "Cold War destroyers of the United States", "Ships built in Bath, Maine"], "title": "USS Glennon (DD-840)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7713064", "text": "Gilles de Rais\n\nGilles de Rais (), Baron de Rais (), was a knight and lord from Brittany, Anjou and Poitou, a leader in the French army, and a companion-in-arms of Joan of Arc. He is best known for his reputation and later conviction as a confessed serial killer of children.\n\nA member of the House of Montmorency-Laval, Gilles de Rais grew up under the tutelage of his maternal grandfather and increased his fortune by marriage. He earned the favour of the Duke of Brittany and was admitted to the French court. From 1427 to 1435, Rais served as a commander in the Royal Army, and fought alongside Joan of Arc against the English and their Burgundian allies during the Hundred Years' War, for which he was appointed Marshal of France.\n\nBetween 1434-1435, he retired from military life, depleted his wealth by staging an extravagant theatrical spectacle of his own composition, and was accused of dabbling in the occult. After 1432, Rais was accused of engaging in a series of child murders, with victims possibly numbering in the hundreds. The killings came to an end in 1440, when a violent dispute with a clergyman led to an ecclesiastical investigation that brought the crimes to light, and attributed them to Rais. At his trial the parents of missing children in the surrounding area and Rais's own confederates in crime testified against him. He was condemned to death and hanged at Nantes on 26 October 1440.\n\nRais is believed to be the inspiration for the 1697 fairy tale \"Bluebeard\" (\"Barbe bleue\") by Charles Perrault.\n\nGilles de Rais was probably born in late 1405 to Guy II de Montmorency-Laval and Marie de Craon in the family castle at Champtocé-sur-Loire. He was an intelligent child, speaking fluent Latin, illuminating manuscripts, and dividing his education between military discipline and moral and intellectual development. Following the deaths of his father and mother in 1415, Gilles and his younger brother René de La Suze were placed under the tutelage of Jean de Craon, their maternal grandfather. Craon was a schemer who attempted to arrange a marriage of 12-year-old Gilles to four-year-old Jeanne Paynel, one of the richest heiresses in Normandy, and, when the plan failed, attempted unsuccessfully to unite the boy with Béatrice de Rohan, the niece to the Duke of Brittany. On 30 November 1420, Craon substantially increased his grandson's fortune by marrying him to Catherine de Thouars of Brittany, heiress of La Vendée and Poitou. Their only child, Marie, was born in 1429.\n\nIn the decades following the Breton War of Succession (1341–64), the defeated faction led by Olivier de Blois, Count of Penthièvre, continued to plot against the Dukes of the House of Montfort. The Blois faction, which refused to relinquish its claim to rule over the Duchy of Brittany, had taken Duke John VI prisoner in violation of the Treaty of Guérande (1365). The 16-year-old Gilles took the side of the House of Montfort. He was able to secure the Duke's release and was rewarded with generous land grants that were converted to monetary gifts.\n\nIn 1425, Rais was introduced to the court of Charles VII at Saumur and learned courtly manners by studying the Dauphin. At the battle for the Château du Lude he took prisoner the English captain Blackburn.\n\nFrom 1427 to 1435, Rais served as a commander in the Royal Army, distinguishing himself for bravery on the battlefield during the renewal of the Hundred Years War. In 1429, he fought alongside Joan of Arc in some of the campaigns waged against the English and their Burgundian allies. He was present with Joan when the Siege of Orléans ended.\n\nOn 17 July 1429, Rais was one of four lords chosen for the honor of bringing the Holy Ampulla from the Abbey of Saint-Remy to Notre-Dame de Reims for the consecration of Charles VII as King of France. On the same day, he was officially created a Marshal of France.\n\nFollowing the Siege of Orléans, Rais was granted the right to add a border of the royal arms, the fleur-de-lys on an azure ground, to his own. The letters patent authorizing the display cited his \"high and commendable services\", the \"great perils and dangers\" he had confronted, and \"many other brave feats\".\n\nIn May 1431, Joan of Arc was burned at the stake; Rais was not present. His grandfather died on 15 November 1432, and, in a public gesture to mark his displeasure with Rais' reckless spending of a carefully amassed fortune, left his sword and his breastplate to Rais' younger brother René de La Suze.\n\nIn either 1434 or 1435, Rais gradually withdrew from military and public life to pursue his own interests: the construction of a splendid Chapel of the Holy Innocents (where he officiated in robes of his own design), and the production of a theatrical spectacle, \"Le Mistère du Siège d'Orléans\". The play consisted of more than 20,000 lines of verse, requiring 140 speaking parts and 500 extras. Rais was almost bankrupt at the time of the production and began selling property as early as 1432 to support his extravagant lifestyle. By March 1433, he had sold all his estates in Poitou (except his wife's) and all his property in Maine. Only two castles in Anjou, Champtocé-sur-Loire and Ingrandes, remained in his possession. Half the total sales and mortgages was spent on the production of his play. It was first performed in Orléans on 8 May 1435. Six hundred costumes were constructed, worn once, discarded, and constructed afresh for subsequent performances. Unlimited supplies of food and drink were made available to spectators at Rais' expense.\n\nIn June 1435, family members gathered to put a curb on Rais. They appealed to Pope Eugene IV to disavow the Chapel of the Holy Innocents (he refused) and carried their concerns to the king. On 2 July 1435, a royal edict was proclaimed in Orléans, Tours, Angers, Pouzauges and Champtocé-sur-Loire denouncing Rais as a spendthrift and forbidding him to sell any more property. No subject of Charles VII was allowed to enter into any contract with him, and those in command of his castles were forbidden to dispose of them. Rais' credit fell immediately and his creditors pressed upon him. He borrowed heavily, using his \"objets d'art\", manuscripts, books and clothing as security. When he left Orléans in late August or early September 1435, the town was littered with precious objects he was forced to leave behind. The edict did not apply to Brittany, and the family was unable to persuade the Duchy of Brittany to enforce it.\n\nIn 1438, according to testimony at his trial by the priest Eustache Blanchet and the cleric François Prelati, Rais sent out Blanchet to seek individuals who knew alchemy and demon summoning. Blanchet contacted Prelati in Florence and persuaded him to take service with his Master. Having reviewed the magical books of Prelati and a traveling Breton, Rais chose to initiate experiments, the first in the lower hall of his castle at Tiffauges, attempting to summon a demon named Barron. Rais provided a contract with the demon for riches that Prelati was to give to the demon later.\n\nAs no demon manifested after three tries, the Marshal grew frustrated with the lack of results. Prelati said Barron was angry and required the offering of parts of a child. Rais provided these remnants in a glass vessel at a future evocation, but to no avail, and the occult experiments left him bitter and his wealth severely depleted.\n\nIn his confession, Rais said the first assaults on children occurred between spring 1432 and spring 1433. The first murders occurred at Champtocé-sur-Loire but no account of them survived. Shortly after, Rais moved to Machecoul, where, according to his confession, he killed, or ordered to be killed, a large but uncertain number of children after he sodomized them.\n\nThe first documented case of child-snatching and murder concerns a boy of 12 called Jeudon (first name unknown), an apprentice to the furrier Guillaume Hilairet. Rais' cousins Gilles de Sillé and Roger de Briqueville asked the furrier to lend them the boy to take a message to Machecoul, and, when Jeudon did not return, the two noblemen told the inquiring furrier that they were ignorant of the boy's whereabouts and suggested he had been carried off by thieves at Tiffauges to be made into a page. At Rais' trial, the events were attested to by Hillairet and his wife, the boy's father Jean Jeudon, and five others from Machecoul.\n\nIn his 1971 biography of Rais, Jean Benedetti tells how the children who fell into Rais' hands were put to death:\n\nRais' bodyservant Étienne Corrillaut, known as Poitou, was an accomplice in many of the crimes and testified that his master stripped the child naked and hung him with ropes from a hook to prevent him from crying out, then masturbated upon the child's belly or thighs. If the victim was a boy he would touch his genitals (particularly testicles) and buttocks. Taking the victim down, Rais comforted the child and assured him he only wanted to play with him. Rais then either killed the child himself or had the child killed by his cousin Gilles de Sillé, Poitou or another bodyservant called Henriet. The victims were killed by decapitation, cutting of their throats, dismemberment, or breaking of their necks with a stick. A short, thick, double-edged sword called a \"braquemard\" was kept at hand for the murders. Poitou further testified that Rais sometimes abused the victims (whether boys or girls) before wounding them and at other times after the victim had been slashed in the throat or decapitated. According to Poitou, Rais disdained the victims' sexual organs, and took \"infinitely more pleasure in debauching himself in this manner ... than in using their natural orifice, in the normal manner.\"\n\nIn his own confession, Gilles testified that “when the said children were dead, he kissed them and those who had the most handsome limbs and heads he held up to admire them, and had their bodies cruelly cut open and took delight at the sight of their inner organs; and very often when the children were dying he sat on their stomachs and took pleasure in seeing them die and laughed”.\n\nPoitou testified that he and Henriet burned the bodies in the fireplace in Rais' room. The clothes of the victim were placed into the fire piece by piece so they burned slowly and the smell was minimized. The ashes were then thrown into the cesspit, the moat, or other hiding places. The last recorded murder was of the son of Éonnet de Villeblanche and his wife Macée. Poitou paid 20 \"sous\" to have a page's doublet made for the victim, who was then assaulted, murdered and incinerated in August 1440.\n\nOn 15 May 1440, Rais kidnapped a cleric during a dispute at the Church of Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte. The act prompted an investigation by the Bishop of Nantes, during which evidence of Rais' crimes was uncovered. On 29 July, the Bishop released his findings, and he subsequently obtained the prosecutorial cooperation of Rais' former protector, John VI, Duke of Brittany. Rais and his bodyservants Poitou and Henriet were arrested on 15 September 1440, following a secular investigation that corroborated the Bishop's. Rais' prosecution was likewise conducted by both secular and ecclesiastical courts, on charges that included murder, sodomy and heresy.\n\nThe extensive witness testimony convinced the judges that there were adequate grounds to establish the guilt of the accused. After Rais admitted to the charges on 21 October, the court canceled a plan to torture him into confessing. Peasants of neighboring villages had earlier begun to make accusations that their children had entered Rais' castle begging for food and never been seen again. The transcript, which included testimony by the parents of many of these children as well as graphic descriptions of the murders provided by Rais' accomplices, was said to be so lurid that the judges ordered the worst parts stricken from the record.\n\nThe number of Rais' victims is not known, as most of the bodies were burned or buried. The number of murders is generally placed between 80 and 200; a few have conjectured that there were more than 600. The victims ranged in age from six to 18 and were predominantly boys.\n\nOn 23 October 1440, the secular court heard the confessions of Poitou and Henriet and condemned them both to death, followed by Rais' death sentence on 25 October. Rais was allowed to make confession, and his request to be buried in the church of the monastery of Notre-Dame des Carmes in Nantes was granted.\n\nExecution by hanging and burning was set for Wednesday 26 October. At nine o‘clock, Rais and his two accomplices processed to the place of execution on the Ile de Biesse. Rais is said to have addressed the crowd with contrite piety and exhorted Henriet and Poitou to die bravely and think only of salvation. His request to be the first to die had been granted the day before. At eleven o'clock, the brush at the platform was set afire and Rais was hanged. His body was cut down before being consumed by the flames and claimed by \"four ladies of high rank\" for burial. Henriet and Poitou were executed in similar fashion but their bodies were reduced to ashes in the flames and then scattered.\n\nAlthough Gilles de Rais was convicted of murdering many children by his confessions and the detailed eyewitness accounts of his own confederates and victims' parents, doubts have persisted about the verdict. Counterarguments are based on the theory that Rais was himself a victim of an ecclesiastic plot or act of revenge by the Catholic Church or French state. Doubts about Rais' guilt have long persisted because the Duke of Brittany, who was given the authority to prosecute, received all the titles to Rais' former lands after his conviction. The Duke then divided the land among his own nobles. Writers such as secret-societies specialist , in his book \"Plaidoyer pour Gilles de Rais\", contend he was a victim of the Inquisition.\n\nIn the early 20th century, anthropologist Margaret Murray and occultist Aleister Crowley questioned the involvement of the ecclesiastic and secular authorities in the case. Crowley described Rais as \"in almost every respect...the male equivalent of Joan of Arc\", whose main crime was \"the pursuit of knowledge\". Murray, who propagated the witch-cult hypothesis, speculated in her book \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\" that Rais was really a witch and an adherent of a fertility cult centered on the pagan goddess Diana. Most historians reject Murray's theory. Norman Cohn argues that it is inconsistent with what is known of Rais' crimes and trial. Historians do not regard Rais as a martyr to a pre-Christian religion; other scholars tend to view him as a lapsed Catholic who descended into crime and depravity, and whose real crimes caused the land forfeitures.\n\nRais was retried during a media event in his home country of France, without any official involvement of the public authorities and the judicial body. In 1992, Freemason Jean-Yves Goëau-Brissonnière, the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of France, organized a self-proclaimed \"court\" consisting of former French ministers, parliament members and UNESCO experts to reexamine the source material and evidence available at the medieval trial. A team of lawyers, writers and politicians led by Gilbert Prouteau and presided over by Judge Henri Juramy found him not guilty, although none of the initiators was a medieval historian by profession. In addition, none of them sought professional advice from certified medievalists.\n\nThe hearing, which concluded Rais was not guilty of the crimes, was partially turned into a fictionalized biography called \"Gilles de Rais ou la Gueule du loup\" (\"Gilles de Rais; or, the Mouth of the Wolf\"), narrated by the writer Gilbert Prouteau. \"The case for Gilles de Rais's innocence is very strong\", Prouteau said. \"No child's corpse was ever found at his castle at Tiffauges and he appears to have confessed to escape excommunication ... The accusations appear to be false charges made up by powerful rival lords to benefit from the confiscation of his lands.\" The journalist Gilbert Philippe of the newspaper \"Ouest-France\" said that Prouteau was being \"facetious and provocative\". He also claimed that Prouteau thought the retrial was basically \"an absolute joke\". Historians continue to believe him guilty of the crimes, mainly differing as to his motivation.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7713064", "categories": ["People of the Hundred Years' War", "French serial killers", "French people convicted of murder", "People executed by France by hanging", "Crimes involving Satanism or the occult", "History of Brittany", "15th-century executions", "Male serial killers", "French rapists", "House of Montmorency-Laval", "1405 births", "Executed serial killers", "People convicted of murder by France", "French alchemists", "People excommunicated by the Catholic Church", "People from Maine-et-Loire", "1440 deaths", "French people of Breton descent", "French murderers of children", "French people convicted of child sexual abuse", "Marshals of France", "Executed French people", "Executed people from Pays de la Loire", "Joan of Arc"], "title": "Gilles de Rais"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7713110", "text": "Griffin\n\nThe griffin, griffon, or gryphon (Greek: γρύφων, \"grýphōn\", or γρύπων, \"grýpōn\", early form \"γρύψ\", \"grýps\"; ) is a legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and sometimes an eagle's talons as its front feet. Because the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts and the eagle the king of birds by the Middle Ages the griffin was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature. Since classical antiquity, Griffins were known for guarding treasure and priceless possessions. \n\nIn Greek and Roman texts, griffins and Arimaspians were associated with gold deposits of Central Asia. Indeed, as Pliny the Elder wrote, \"griffins were said to lay eggs in burrows on the ground and these nests contained gold nuggets.\" \n\nIn medieval heraldry, the Griffin became a Christian symbol of divine power and a guardian of the divine.\n\nThe derivation of this word remains uncertain. It could be related to the Greek word γρυπός (grypos), meaning 'curved', or 'hooked'. Also, this could have been an Anatolian loan word, compare Akkadian \"karūbu\" (winged creature), and similar to Cherub. A related Hebrew word is כרוב (\"kerúv\").\n\nMost statuary representations of griffins depict them with bird-like talons, although in some older illustrations griffins have a lion's forelimbs; they generally have a lion's hindquarters. Its eagle's head is conventionally given prominent ears; these are sometimes described as the lion's ears, but are often elongated (more like a horse's), and are sometimes feathered.\n\nInfrequently, a griffin is portrayed without wings, or a wingless eagle-headed lion is identified as a griffin. In 15th-century and later heraldry, such a beast may be called an alce or a keythong.\n\nIn heraldry, a griffin always has forelegs like an eagle's hind-legs. A type of griffin with the four legs of a lion was distinguished by perhaps only one English herald of later heraldry as the Opinicus, which also had a camel-like neck and a short tail that almost resembles a camel's tail.\n\nRepresentations of griffin-like hybrids with four legs and a beaked head appeared in Ancient Iranian and Ancient Egyptian art dating back to before 3000 BC. In Egypt, a griffin-like animal can be seen in a cosmetic palette from Hierakonpolis, known as the \"Two Dog Palette\", which is dated to ca. 3300-3100 BC.\n\nIn Iranian mythology, griffin is called Shirdal means: Lion-Eagle. The Shirdal has appeared in ancient art of Iran since late second millennium BC. Shirdals appeared on cylinder seals from Susa as early as 3000 BC. Shirdals also are common motifs in the art of Luristan, North and North West region of Iran in Iron Age, and Achaemenid art.\n\nGriffin-type creatures combining raptor heads and mammalian bodies were depicted in the Levant, Syria, and Anatolia in the Middle Bronze Age, dated at about 1950-1550 BC. Early depictions of griffin types in Ancient Greek art are found in the 15th century BC frescoes in the Throne Room of the Bronze Age Palace of Knossos, as restored by Sir Arthur Evans. Bird-mammal composites were a decorative theme in Archaic and Classical Greek art, but became quite popular by the sixth and fifth centuries BC\n\nIn Central Asia, the griffin appears about a thousand years after Bronze Age Crete, in the 5th–4th centuries BC, reminiscent of iamges in the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Russian jewelry historian Elena Neva maintained that the Achaemenids considered the griffin \"a protector from evil, witchcraft and secret slander\". But no writings exist from Achaemenid Persia to support this claim. Robin Lane Fox, in \"Alexander the Great,\" 1973:31 and notes p. 506, remarks that a 'lion-griffin' attacks a stag in a pebble mosaic of the fourth century BC at Pella, perhaps serving as an emblem of the kingdom of Macedon or a personal one of Alexander's successor Antipater.\n\nThe Pisa Griffin is a large bronze sculpture that has been in Pisa in Italy since the Middle Ages, though it is of Islamic origin. It is the largest bronze medieval Islamic sculpture known, at over three feet tall (42.5 inches, or 1.08 m.), and was probably created in the 11th century in Al-Andaluz (Islamic Spain). From about 1100 it was placed on a column on the roof of Pisa Cathedral until replaced by a replica in 1832; the original is now in the Museo dell' Opera del Duomo (Cathedral Museum), Pisa.\n\nAdrienne Mayor, a classical folklorist and historian of science, proposes that the ancient Greek idea and image of the griffin in classical art and literature beginning in the seventh century BC was influenced in part by the fossilized remains of beaked dinosaurs such as \"Protoceratops\" observed on the way to gold deposits by nomadic prospectors of ancient Scythia (Central Asia), This hypothesis is necessarily speculative, based on a number of Greek and Latin literary sources and related artworks, beginning with the first written ancient descriptions of griffins in a lost work by Aristeas of Proconnessus (a Greek who traveled to the Altai region between Mongolia and NW China) in the seventh century BC), cited by Aeschylus and Herodotus (ca 450 BC) and ending with Aelian (third century AD). Mayor's suggestion has been contested in a blog claiming that it ignores pre-Mycenaean accounts and bird-lion composites in earlier art that goes far earlier than 7th century BCE.. \n\nA multitude of imaginary composite creatures combining features of birds, reptiles, and mammals can be found in ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern art, including mammals with bird heads in Minoan, Mycenaean,and Egyptian art, but there are no pre-Mycenaean written accounts about Griffins; and as Mayor has explained, in fact no written accounts earlier than Herodotus in the fifth century BC survive to tell us anything about imaginary hybrid bird-lion imagery in earlier cultures. Mayor's suggestion is necessarily speculative, intended to account for the profusion of Greco-Latin literary accounts of the \"gryps\" (Griffin) as a real animal of the East and the accompanying popularity of artistic representations that arose in Greece after travelers like Aristeas brought back tales of \"Griffins\" from Central Asia.\n\nSeveral ancient mythological creatures are similar to the griffin. These include the Lamassu, an Assyrian protective deity, often depicted with a bull or lion's body, eagle's wings, and human's head.\n\nSumerian and Akkadian mythology feature the demon Anzu, half man and half bird, associated with the chief sky god Enlil. This was a divine storm-bird linked with the southern wind and the thunder clouds.\n\nJewish mythology speaks of the Ziz, which resembles Anzu, as well as the ancient Greek Phoenix. The Bible mentions the Ziz in Psalms 50:11. This is also similar to Cherub. The cherub, or sphinx, was very popular in Phoenician iconography.\n\nIn ancient Crete, griffins became very popular, and were portrayed in various media. A similar creature is the Minoan Genius.\n\nIn the Hindu religion, Garuda is a large bird-like creature which serves as a\nmount (\"vahana\") of the Lord Vishnu. It is also the name for the constellation Aquila.\n\nIn medieval legend, griffins not only mated for life, but if either partner died, then the other would continue the rest of its life alone, never to search for a new mate. The griffin was thus made an emblem of the Church's opposition to remarriage. Being a union of an aerial bird and a terrestrial beast, it was seen in Christendom to be a symbol of Jesus, who was both human and divine. As such it can be found sculpted on some churches.\n\nAccording to Stephen Friar's \"New Dictionary of Heraldry\", a griffin's claw was believed to have medicinal properties and one of its feathers could restore sight to the blind. Goblets fashioned from griffin claws (actually antelope horns) and griffin eggs (actually ostrich eggs) were highly prized in medieval European courts.\n\nWhen Genoa emerged as a major seafaring power in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, griffins commenced to be depicted as part of the republic's coat of arms, rearing at the sides of the shield bearing the Cross of St. George.\n\nBy the 12th century, the appearance of the griffin was substantially fixed: \"All its bodily members are like a lion's, but its wings and mask are like an eagle's.\" It is not yet clear if its forelimbs are those of an eagle or of a lion. Although the description implies the latter, the accompanying illustration is ambiguous. It was left to the heralds to clarify that.\n\nA hippogriff is a legendary creature, supposedly the offspring of a griffin and a mare.\n\nIn heraldry, the griffin's amalgamation of lion and eagle gains in courage and boldness, and it is always drawn to powerful fierce monsters. It is used to denote strength and military courage and leadership. Griffins are portrayed with the rear body of a lion, an eagle's head with erect ears, a feathered breast, and the forelegs of an eagle, including claws. These features indicate a combination of intelligence and strength.\n\nIn British heraldry, a male griffin is shown without wings, its body covered in tufts of formidable spikes, with a short tusk emerging from the forehead, as for a unicorn.

After that comes a region of very rich soil but quite uninhabitable because griffins, a savage and tenacious breed of wild beasts, love- to an amazing degree- the gold that is mined from deep within the earth there, and because they guard it with an amazing hostility to those who set foot there.\" (Romer, 1998.)\n\nIsidore of Seville – \"The Gryphes are so called because they are winged quadrupeds. This kind of wild beast is found in the Hyperborean Mountains. In every part of their body they are lions, and in wings and heads are like eagles, and they are fierce enemies of horses. Moreover they tear men to pieces.\" (Brehaut, 1912)\nThe griffin is the symbol of the Philadelphia Museum of Art; bronze castings of them perch on each corner of the museum's roof, protecting its collection. Similarly, prior to the mid-1990s a griffin formed part of the logo of Midland Bank (now HSBC).\n\nThe griffin is used in the logo of United Paper Mills, Vauxhall Motors, and of Scania and its former group partners SAAB-Aircraft and Saab Automobile.

The scientific name for the Andean condor is \"Vultur gryphus\", Latin for \"griffin-vulture\". The Catholic Douay-Rheims version of the Bible uses griffon for a creature referred to as vulture or ossifrage in other English translations (Leviticus 11:13).\n\nA theory, postulated by Adrienne Mayor, is that the griffin of classical Greek literature and art was influenced by observations and accounts brought back to the Mediterranean region by traders and travelers along the Silk Road from the Turfan Basin and western reaches of the Gobi Desert where fully articulated white fossils of \"Protoceratops\" beaked dinosaurs continually weather out against reddish ground. Such fossils, seen by ancient observers, may have been interpreted as evidence of a half-bird-half-mammal creature . Over repeated retelling and drawing recopying its bony neck frill (which is rather fragile and may have been frequently broken or entirely weathered away) may become large mammal-type external ears, and its beak may be treated as evidence of part-bird nature and lead to bird-type wings being added.\n\nPaleontologist Mark Witton has contested this hypothesis, believing that it relies on ignorance of pre-Greek griffin accounts and art, which have occurred considerably before the Central Asian trade scenario. But no \"pre-Greek griffin written accounts\" exist to tell us what was believed about imaginary hybrid bird-mammal and other composite figures from the pre-classical time period. Mayor's hypothesis suggests that unfamiliar fossils exhibiting bird and mammal features--beaks, four legs, and eggs in nests-- can help explain the belief recorded in numerous Greek and Roman sources from Herodotus and Aeschylus to Pliny, Pausanias, and Aelian that Griffins were real animals observed in the deserts along the Silk Route and might also help account for the proliferation of reports and illustrations of Griffins that began after the seventh century BC.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7713110", "categories": ["Greek legendary creatures", "Mythological birds of prey", "Egyptian legendary creatures", "Heraldic beasts", "Griffins", "European legendary creatures"], "title": "Griffin"}

Its stated goal is to \"win the heart and soul of America for Mary by spreading Our Lady of Fátima message and promoting devotion to her Immaculate Heart.\" \n\nAmerica Needs Fatima was founded in February 1985. C. Preston Noell III. was its first Executive Director until 1996, when leadership of the organization passed to Robert E. Ritchie, who remains Executive Director today. America Needs Fatima claims an active membership of 193,000. The headquarters are in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, in the United States.\n\nAmerica Needs Fatima is involved in advocacy and education on a range of issues, including abortion, same-sex marriage, euthanasia, and socialism. It applies the message of Our Lady of Fatima to what it sees as the \"moral crisis\" in society.\n\nSince 1994, the primary activity of America Needs Fatima has been the \"Mary in Every Home\" program. It consists of a Fatima custodian taking a four-foot tall statue of Our Lady of Fátima to a person's home, with a crowning and enthronement ceremony, a short audio-visual about the story of Fátima, Portugal, and the praying of the rosary. ANF claims to have visited approximately 10,000 homes in all 50 states with this program.\n\nAmerica Needs Fatima has protested films, plays, and art exhibits it considers blasphemous or otherwise offensive to Catholicism.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7713134", "text": "Red Ingle\n\nErnest Jansen \"Red\" Ingle (7 November 1906 – 6 September 1965) was an American musician, singer and songwriter, arranger, cartoonist and caricaturist. He is best known for his comedy records with Spike Jones and his own Natural Seven sides for Capitol.\n\nIngle was born in Toledo, Ohio on 7 November 1906. He was taught basic violin from age five by Fritz Kreisler, a family friend. However at 13, he took up the saxophone, and that instrument later became his main instrument. Ingle received a music scholarship and studied at the Toledo American College of Music, playing classical music on a concert level. Ingle was also influenced by the country fiddlers he had heard; he was able to play their songs in their style as well as the classics in a traditional pose. At 15 he was playing professionally with Al Amato, and by his late teens, Ingle was touring steadily with the Jean Goldkette Orchestra, along with future jazz legends Bix Beiderbecke and Frankie Trumbauer. A graduate of Toledo's Scott High School, at one time he intended to become a teacher. Ingle left the College of Music in 1926 to become a full-time musician when he married Edwina Alice Smith. He joined Ted Weems' Orchestra in 1931, after briefly being a bandleader himself, and working under Maurice Sherman. His work with Weems was such a success that they worked together into the 1940s. Singer Perry Como later called Ingle 'one of the most talented men I've ever met.'\n\nA pilot since 1924, Ingle wrote the Army Air Forces \"I've Got Wings\" manual as part of his wartime work at the Civil Aeronautics Administration. A talented leather carver whose saddles were in demand by celebrities, he also taught the skill in Veterans' hospitals during this time. One of Ingle's carved saddles was on exhibit at the Golden Gate International Exposition World's fair in San Francisco in 1939: a saddle carved with images illustrating the history of the state of California.\n\nIngle's son, Don, followed his father into the music business in 1949.\n\nAfter he failed an eye test for the Air Force, he returned to music with Spike Jones & His City Slickers, where his comedic talents and flair for vocal effects found a welcoming home. Jones started featuring him as a frontman immediately, and Ingle's stage presence helped transform the City Slickers' stage act into something more visual than before.\n\nWith Ingle's input, the band gradually became a complete stage package that would eventually peak (after his departure in 1946) in the late 1940s and early 1950s with the successful \"Musical Depreciation Revue.\"\n\n\"There was nobody in the band as funny as Red,\" said Zep Meissner, the band's clarinetist; \"guys like him were funny in themselves, they didn't need material.\"\n\nAn example of his routine appears in the film \"Bring on the Girls\", where he takes off the vaudeville song \"Chloe.\" He would run on in a frightwig, combat boots and a nightgown, while waving a lantern, climaxing the song with the cry \"I gotta go!\" as he dived into an outhouse. A record of this song went gold for the band, spending four weeks in the top ten. He was also the featured vocalist on other City Slickers hits, such as \"You Always Hurt the One You Love\", \"Liebestraum\" and \"Glow Worm\" - this last being featured in the film \"Breakfast in Hollywood\", one of many films featuring the band.\n\nIngle left Jones and the City Slickers in November 1946 after a salary dispute. He drifted through Radio and Hollywood, even working in light opera, until he made \"Tim-Tay-Shun\", a spoof recording of the then-popular Perry Como hit \"Temptation\", with Jo Stafford (under the name \"Cinderella G. Stump\") for Capitol Records in 1947. As the single went on to sell three million copies, Ingle formed a new band - Red Ingle and His Natural Seven; the group included several former City Slickers, among them Country Washburn, who had arranged \"Tim-Tay-Shun\". The band had several more hits, including \"Cigareetes, Whuskey, and Wild, Wild Women\", \"Them Durn Fool Things,\" and \"'A', You're a Dopey Gal.\" \"Cigareetes\" became a hit because it was banned from radio airplay by all major networks.\n\nAfter \"Tim-Tay-Shun's\" success, Ingle had a follow-up in mind: a take-off on the classical works of Paganini, but doing this required a violinist who was trained in classical music. Knowing that any direct requests for a classical performer would be refused, Ingle dreamed up his own \"classical\" ensemble: \"Ernest Ingle's Miniature Symphony\". A concert violinist responded and was quickly signed to a recording contract for the intended record. When the musician was shown the arrangement he was to play, he protested and attempted to leave without performing. Ingle and his band quickly reminded the violinist of the legality of the contract he had just signed. A deal was struck to get \"Pagan Ninny's Keep 'Er Going Stomp\" recorded: the concert performer was allowed to use a pseudonym on the record.\n\nIngle and his Natural Seven also performed with \"Grand Ole Opry\" performers such as Minnie Pearl and other Opry notables. He joined Jo Stafford on her 1949 tour of the Midwest. Despite the comedy emphasis, the quality of the musicianship was often outstanding, including in some cases Les Paul or Western Swing performers Tex Williams and steel guitarist Noel Boggs. The band also recorded short films of their numbers, before disbanding in 1952; by 1956, Ingle had formed the band once again.\n\nAfter working again with Weems, Ingle eased out of music, tiring of touring. He reunited with Jo Stafford in 1960 for a performance of \"Tim-Tay-Shun\" on \"Startime\"; by this time he had lost a great deal of weight and was barely recognizable as the former leader of the Natural Seven. He also had a reunion with Perry Como; band leader Ted Weems and former fellow band members Ingle, Elmo Tanner, Parker Gibbs and \"Country\" Washburn appeared as guests on Como's \"Kraft Music Hall\" on 18 October 1961. There was one last reunion with Spike Jones, an album called \"Persuasive Concussion\" (satirizing the then-popular \"Persuasive Percussion\" albums). It was never completed; Jones died in 1965. Ingle also died the same year of an internal hemorrhage. Excerpts from \"Persuasive Concussion,\" featuring Ingle, were issued on LP in the 1970s (\"The Very Best of Spike Jones\", on the United Artists label).\n\nIngle said he had been trying to retire from the music business since 1942; he signed up with Spike Jones a year later, and that his leaving the band in 1946 was another try at retirement. By 1948 he described himself as being resigned to staying in the field.\n\nIngle died September 6, 1965, in Santa Barbara, California and was buried in Ovid, Michigan.\n\n\n", "id": "7713134", "categories": ["Musicians from Toledo, Ohio", "20th-century American musicians", "1965 deaths", "Comedians from Ohio", "American comedy musicians", "American bandleaders", "1906 births"], "title": "Red Ingle"}

This amalgamation joined five municipalities — the townships of East Williams, West Williams and McGillivray, the town of Parkhill and the village of Ailsa Craig — to form one municipal corporation. North Middlesex has a population of 6,658 as of the Canada 2011 Census.\n\nNorth Middlesex is located in the north of Middlesex County, north of London, Ontario.\n\nAilsa Craig is a community on the Ausable River. Ailsa Craig is best known for its annual Gala Days event. The town was the home of Earl Ross, the first non-American to win a NASCAR Nextel Cup race, which he did in 1974. Earl was also NASCAR Winston Cup Rookie of the year in 1974.\n\nThe winningest harness horse driver in the world also hails from the Ailsa Craig area. With over 10,000 wins, John Campbell is one of the youngest members to enter the Harness Horseman's Hall of Fame.\n\nAilsa Craig was named by the Craig family after a namesake island in the outer Firth of Clyde, Scotland, and the word is derived from the Gaelic, \"Aillse Creag\", or \"Creag Ealasaid\", meaning \"Elizabeth's rock\". In the early 20th century, Ailsa Craig was a thriving village with several hotels, mills and served as the commercial hub for the farm businesses in the area. Located on the Grand Trunk Railway, Ailsa Craig was once the second largest cattle shipping center in all of Canada surpassed only by Calgary, Alberta. As a child, Norman Bethune often spent his summers in the village.\n\nParkhill owes its beginning to the coming of the railway. In 1859, the Grand Trunk Railway completed a line from St. Mary's to Sarnia. The following year the first Post Office and store were opened at the present site of Parkhill.\n\nParkhill was originally known as Westwood, named Swainsby in 1861 and finally Parkhill in 1863. Parkhill's growth was slow at first until a grist mill was constructed in the community. Other industries including saw mills, a foundry, a flax mill and a woollen mill became a part of Parkhill. By 1871, the community had a population of 1500. Parkhill was incorporated as a village in 1872 and as a town in 1886. Many fine old Victorian commercial buildings such as the Cheapside Block and Gibbs Block can be found located along Main Street. Parkhill also has many handsome churches and houses throughout the town. The township's administrative offices are located in Parkhill.\n\nThe township also contains the communities of Beechwood, Bornish, Bowood, Brinsley, Carlisle, Corbett, Greenway, Hungry Hollow, Lieury, Moray, Mount Carmel, Nairn, Sable, Springbank, Sylvan and West McGillivray.

It opened in 1915 and was demolished in 1973.\n\nThe Doric-colonnaded amphitheater was built between Amsterdam and Convent Avenues, from 136th to 138th Streets. Financier and philanthropist Adolph Lewisohn donated the money for construction. It opened in 1915, with a seating capacity of 8,000.\n\nThe stadium hosted many athletic, musical, and theatrical events. It was one of New York's public landmarks.\n\nLewisohn Stadium was demolished in 1973 to make way for the $125 million North Academic Center. In 1985, a plaza outside the Center was rededicated as the Lewisohn Plaza, in memory of the stadium and its philanthropist.\n\nThe CCNY football team played its home games at Lewisohn from 1921 to 1950. The final game played was a 33–6 Beavers victory over Lowell Textile on November 18, 1950, in front of 300 fans. (It was CCNY's only win that season, and the program was discontinued the following year.)\n\nAlong with Jasper Oval (right across Convent Avenue, also now demolished), Lewisohn was used throughout the academic year for many of the college's uptown campus outdoor intramural sports.\n\nThe CCNY Varsity Rifle Team had its indoor, 50' small bore range under the stadium steps, entered through a doorway at the north end. For many years, the CCNY Rifle Team excelled in national, regional and local competition and was consistently in the NRA-sponsored Top Ten national ranking, with the best record of any team at CCNY. Unfortunately, the team dissolved within 3 years of the loss of Lewisohn. The range was notoriously loud, with a steel backstop and concrete walls, and no acoustic insulation.\n\nBesides sporting events, the stadium was used for performances starting in 1918. Performers included Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic (sometimes called the \"Stadium Symphony Orchestra\"), Renata Tebaldi Kirsten Flagstad, Marian Anderson, Alfredo Antonini, and Eugene Ormandy. Leopold Stokowski made a series of recordings for Everest with the \"Stadium Symphony Orchestra of New York.\" George Gershwin played his \"Rhapsody in Blue\". Performers ranged from Van Cliburn, Jascha Heifetz, and Yehudi Menuhin to Leontyne Price, Roberta Peters, Licia Albanese, Jan Peerce, Richard Tucker, Placido Domingo, Pete Seeger, Thomas Hayward (tenor), Harry Belafonte, Jack Benny, Benny Goodman, and conductor Kurt Adler of the Metropolitan Opera. Due to declining attendances, the concerts were discontinued in 1966.\n\nThe stadium was used by City College for its commencement exercises. All CCNY campuses took part, including Liberal Arts, Engineering and Architecture, and its Manhattan Business School (now Baruch College). This practice continued through June 1973.\n\nIt was also used for CCNY's annual Army ROTC's reviews at the end of each academic year. \n\nThe stadium appeared as the setting of the final scene of the 1945 film \"Rhapsody in Blue\" in which Oscar Levant performs the title composition, with an orchestra conducted by Paul Whiteman, as a memorial to the composer. The derelict stadium was also used in the 1973 film \"Serpico\", directed by Sidney Lumet, in a scene with Tony Roberts and Al Pacino. \n\n", "id": "7713297", "categories": ["Demolished sports venues in New York (state)", "Defunct college football venues", "1973 disestablishments in New York (state)", "1915 establishments in New York (state)", "Event venues established in 1915", "Former sports venues in New York City", "Sports venues demolished in 1973", "CCNY Beavers football", "American football venues in New York City", "Defunct sports venues in Manhattan"], "title": "Lewisohn Stadium"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7713429", "text": "History of Iberia (airline)\n\nIberia Líneas Aéreas de España, S.A. (\"Iberia Airlines of Spain\" in English), usually shortened to Iberia, is the largest airline of Spain, based in Madrid.\n\nThe years following World War I saw a large advancement in aircraft technology with concomitant increase in possibilities for rapid connections between international business concerns. Germany had many business concerns, particularly in Africa and South America, but was still reliant on ships and land routes to reach these. In order to circumvent the Treaty of Versailles stipulation that prohibited German aircraft access to flying over France, agents in Spain explored the possibility an air liaison between Germany and Spain. As such Deutsche Luft Hansa on behalf of German government, established a general agreement with the Spanish government which was signed on December 9, 1927 authorizing an air service between both countries.\n\nIberia, Compañía Aérea de Transportes was incorporated on June 28, 1927 with an initial capital investment by the financier Horacio Echeberrieta and Deutsche Luft Hansa of 1.1 million pesetas. The company obtained Government authorisation to establish commercial daily (except Sunday) connections between Madrid and Barcelona. A fleet of three Rohrbach Roland monoplanes were bought in from Deutsche Luft Hansa.\n\nFlight operations started on December 14, 1927 with inaugural flights aimed to coincide at a commemorative show in Madrid. The opening ceremony at Carabanchel aerodrome was attended by Alfonso XIII and the president of Iberia, Horacio Echeberrieta. The maiden flight from Madrid left on schedule, taking off from Madrid at 12:30 and arriving in Barcelona 3½ hours later. However the Barcelona to Madrid flight was briefly forced to stop in Almazán, Soria due to reduced visibility caused by snow. Although this flight had set off at 9:00, aiming to arrive in Madrid at midday, the delay meant it arrived in Madrid two hours after the dignitaries had already left.Within a year, the company was sponsored by the government to provide postal transport between Madrid and Barcelona. Meanwhile, Deutsche Luft Hansa was favourably rewarded for the 24% investment in the Iberia company when it was granted the regular service between Germany and Spain. On January 5, 1928 the route Barcelona – Marseilles – Geneva – Zürich – Stuttgart – Leipzig/Halle – Erfurt – Berlin was initiated. In July 1928, a twin-engined Dornier Wal was added to the fleet. This seaplane was used on a pioneering route between Cádiz and the Canary Islands. This was used to test the viability of a postal route to South America, by extending the route \"via\" Cape Verde Islands.\n\nDuring the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, it was proposed that the aviation companies in Spain should be combined and become state-controlled as a general interest public utility. This came into effect in early 1928. As a consequence, Iberia was merged into Compañía de Líneas Aéreas Subvencionadas \"S.A.\" (C.L.A.S.S.A.) together with the following other airlines Unión Aérea Española (U.A.E.), Compañía Española de Tráfico Aéreo (C.E.T.A.) the pilot training company Compañía Española de Aviación (C.E.A.) and the airship line Transaérea Colón.\n\nAlthough Iberia ceased activities on 29 May 1929, barely eighteen months after having begun operations, the name \"Iberia\" continued to be registered by Director-General Daniel de Araoz y Aréjula. Of all the airlines that formed CLASSA, Iberia would be the only one to keep in existence after the merger.\n\nFollowing the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 the LAPE \"(Líneas Aéreas Postales Españolas)\" company, the airline that would replace CLASSA, became established. LAPE began operations in April 1932, CLASSA flying under the Spanish Republican Flag for one year.\n\nLAPE operated even during the Spanish Civil War, mainly in its Madrid - Barcelona line, although a great part of the planes of its fleet were requisitioned by the Spanish Republican Air Force and used as military transports.\n\nAs the name \"Iberia\" was still registered, it was used anew when airline operations began in 1937 in territory held by the rebel faction during the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, after the end of the conflict, the planes belonging to LAPE's fleet were repainted with the Iberia airline livery.\n\nWhen the Iberia company fully restarted operations following the Civil War, it became a purely domestic airline. It won the right to many of the international routes, such as the service between Madrid and Lisbon; which had been previously established in early 1927 by Unión Aérea Española (U.A.E.). \n\nOne eighth of the new Iberia's capital investment was offered to Ala Littoria, fascist Italy's airline. After some deliberation, due to its negative experience in investing in the related Corporacion Sud Americana dos Servicios Aéreos, Ala Littoria decided to invest capital in Iberia in the form of two aircraft which were to join Iberia's fleet. The new Iberia's shares were held by the Spanish government (51%) and private investors (49%). Foreign interests could only own up to a maximum of 50% of the 49% of Iberia shares allocated to foreign investment. Ala Littoria purchased three Ju 52 airframes (without engines) from Lufthansa and gave them to Iberia in lieu of capital. The aircraft were put to work initially on the Rome-Venice-Munich-Berlin route.\n\nThe company still had close ties with Lufthansa, which during World War II caused considerable difficulties to maintain the fleet as the import of fuel and spare parts was infrequent. In addition the Allied Powers refused cooperation with the company until connections with Nazi Germany were severed.\n\nThe airline was nationalised on September 30, 1944, becoming part of INI. In 1946, using the Douglas DC-4 on the Madrid to Montevideo and Buenos Aires route, it became the first airline to fly between Europe and South America after WWII. The lucrative market to South America was helped by the families separated by the Civil War. However, there was intense competition from Air France, KLM and British South American Airways. Since the company was struggling to meet domestic demand, the Government allowed another company, Aviaco, to operate the domestic routes that Iberia did not use from February 18, 1948.\n\nBy the Pact of Madrid in 1953, visa requirements were eliminated for US visitors to Spain. This stimulated the commencement of transatlantic flights between Spain and United States the following year. In addition, the amendments made in Montreal to the Convention on International Civil Aviation on June 14, 1954 were liberal to Spain, allowing impetus for mass tourism using charter planes. Iberia responded to the increased traffic by acquiring a fleet of Lockheed Super Constellation long range aircraft and these served the routes to North and South America from 1954. The pressurised twin-engined Convair 440 was introduced to the company's European routes from 1957.\n\nFrom 1961 Iberia had a fleet of Douglas DC-8 four-engined long range jet airliners. The busiest route was Madrid to Buenos Aires. By 1965 a joint board of Iberia and Aviaco was set up to coordinate policies so that services did not conflict. In the early 1970s the company bought Douglas DC-9s and Boeing 747s as it expanded routes to Central America, Warsaw, Athens and Istanbul.\n\nIn 1974 it launched Europe's first walk-on shuttle service, linking Madrid and Barcelona. That year it established the Serviberia telephone information service, the precursor of today's popular call centres, as well as the 'Red Jackets', uniformed ground staff with the mission of providing special service to customers and to resolve any problems that might arise.\n\nBy the 50th anniversary in 1977 the airline carried over 10 million passengers in a year for the first time. There was fierce internal and political debates over the use of Douglas DC-9s or Boeing 727s; with the result that Iberia bought Boeing 727s thereby boosting Boeing's flagging production line. However this financial commitment and subsequent failure to anticipate predicted passenger numbers, caused heavy losses for the company during the 1980s. This was especially disappointing in 1982, with the visit of Pope and the football World Cup. By 1987 routes to Tel Aviv, Khartoum, Moscow and Tokyo were added.\n\nIn the late 1980s/early 1990s Iberia planned a fleet renewal with the McDonnell Douglas MD-87, Airbus A320 and Airbus A340 replacing the Douglas DC-9, Boeing 727 and Douglas DC-10 respectively. A number of Boeing 757s were also bought.\n\nAt this time Iberia began to build up interests in other Spanish airlines – Aviaco, Viva Air, Binter Canarias and Binter Mediterráneo – and Latin American airlines Aerolíneas Argentinas, Viasa and Ladeco. In June 1990 the company led a consortium to buy Aerolíneas Argentinas for an agreed $2billion for 85% stake and the following year bought 45% stake in Viasa for $145million.\n\nIn 1991 Iberia set up Europe's first international airline frequent-flyer programme, \"Iberia Plus\", and, in 1996, the airline launched the www.iberia.com website. The company ordered 76 aircraft from Airbus in February 1998, which was largest single consignment of Airbus ordered, and bought Aviaco in 1999 and inherited its fleet. This was the start of Iberia's shift from a Boeing/McDonnell Douglas fleet to an Airbus fleet.\n\nBy this stage privatisation calls from European Union and Spanish Government were being implemented. In December 1999 the company became semi-privatised with shares distributed 40% shareholders, 9% British Airways for €245million and 1% American Airlines. An initial public offering on October 2000 failed to go ahead, due to internal business difficulties, most notably the failure to offload stock in Aerolíneas Argentinas.\n\nIberia is an international transportation group, operating in about 100 airports in 40 countries, employing more than 26,000 people.\n\nIn 2002, Iberia celebrated its 75th anniversary making it one of the oldest airlines in the world. During those 75 years nearly 500 million people have been flown by Iberia, placing the company among the five largest European airlines, and important for routes connecting Spain with Europe and Latin America.\n\nThe Iberia Group encompasses the Iberia Regional/Air Nostrum franchise. In addition to transporting passengers and freight, Iberia carries out many related activities, such as aircraft maintenance, handling in airports, IT systems, in-flight catering, and holiday packages.\n\nIberia Group airlines fly to 97 destinations in 40 countries. Via code-sharing arrangements with other companies, it offers flights to another 60 destinations in 25 countries. With a fleet of almost 200 aircraft, it makes about 1,000 flights each day. In 2002, Iberia carried 28 million passengers and 210,000 tons of freight.\n\nIn addition, Iberia is an aircraft maintenance company, servicing its own fleet and those of another 48 companies, including some European airlines. Iberia is the main supplier of aircraft handling services at all Spanish airports, with more than 200 airline clients.\n\nIberia was a founding partner in the computerised air ticket reservation system Amadeus CRS, with an 18.28% stake – this was sold in 2005. It is also a tour operator through its Viva Tours and Tiempo Libre units, and with Cacesa it supplies package delivery services.\n\nIberia is allied with American Airlines and British Airways, and on September 1, 1999, joined the Oneworld alliance. British Airways owns 9% of its share capital.\n\nIn July 2004, Iberia announced it had decided to move its Latin American hub from Miami, Florida to San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Although rumoured plans that the airline was considering to set the hub at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport were discarded with the announcement, Iberia announced that it plans to expand its Puerto Rican schedules to connect San Juan with Central American cities.\nIn 2005, Iberia introduced its new Business Plus Class, on its Airbus A340 aircraft.\n\nOn February 5, 2006 the new Terminal 4 at Madrid Barajas was awarded to Iberia and the Oneworld alliance members. This provided expansion capabilities for Iberia. Iberia alone is responsible for around 60% of Madrid Barajas traffic. In 2005 Iberia and its regional branch Air Nostrum transported 21,619,041 passengers to/from Madrid Barajas alone.\n\nIberia partially owns a low-cost carrier called Clickair, launched in November 2006.\n\nOn November 12, 2009, Iberia Airlines confirmed that it had reached a preliminary agreement to merge with British Airways. The merger between the two carriers will create the world's third-largest airline in terms of revenue. On April 25, 2010, it was confirmed that British Airways and Iberia had agreed to a merger, forming the International Airlines Group, although each airline would continue to operate under its current brand. International Airlines Group, established its head office in London and its registered office in Madrid, operating mainly from its two main hubs of London Heathrow Airport and Madrid Barajas Airport with secondary hubs at London Gatwick Airport and Barcelona El Prat Airport.\n\nAs of January 2016, a total of 37 aircraft operated by or for Iberia have been written off in accidents and a shoot-down since 1939. Several Iberia aircraft have also been hijacked. These incidents and accidents include the following:\n", "id": "7713429", "categories": ["Iberia (airline)", "History of airlines", "History of companies of Spain"], "title": "History of Iberia (airline)"}

She is a Flamenco cantaora (singer), bolero singer, and composer. She is widely recognized as one of the most important flamenco voices of her generation. She has also devoted part of her career to other genres such as Spanish American music, especially bolero.\n\nShe started singing as a small child in her family environment, and at the age of 10 she won an amateur singing contest organized by a supermarket. After this, she started performing regularly as an amateur at the peñas flamencas in Barcelona and its outskirts, and became a professional at the age of 16. In the meantime, she acquired a solid knowledge of flamenco styles, mainly by listening intensively to recordings of flamenco cantaores like Juan Valderrama, Manolo Caracol, Camarón de la Isla, Lole Montoya and most of all, Pastora Pavón, also known as La Niña de los Peines. She also received some formal musical training, and practised her skills as a \"cantaora de atrás\" (singer for flamenco dance).\n\nIn 1987 she won the first prize or Lámpara Minera at the Concurso Nacional de La Unión (also known as Festival de las Minas). Two years later, she obtained the Antonio Chacón Prize (bestowed on the best malagueña at the \"Concurso Nacional de Arte Flamenco de Córdoba\"). At the same time, she started an international career after being chosen by Peter Gabriel to perform at Womad Festivals. In 1994, she recorded her first album, \"Muy Frágil\", with guitarist Chicuelo and arrangements by Joan Albert Amargós (the later a regular contributor to other well-known flamenco musicians like Paco de Lucía and Camarón de la Isla). In 2000 she published her second flamenco recording, 'Querencia', which was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award to the Best Flamenco Album in 2001.\n\nAlthough already well-established as a solo cantaora, she resumed her facet as a singer for dance when she met bailaora Belén Maya in 1996, with whom she has toured the world with the works \"Mayte Martín + Belén Maya\" (since 1996) and \"Flamenco de Cámara\" (since 2003), winning international critical acclaim.\n\nIn 1997, she received the Barcelona City Award, granted by the City Council, and the National Music Award in the category of \"Best Flamenco Composer\".\n\nIn 1993 she started touring with jazz pianist Tete Montoliu, a professional relationship that lasted until Montoliu's death in 1997. Together, they offered a personal view on boleros in their live recording 'Free Boleros', recorded in 1996. In her second bolero recording, 'Tiempo de Amar', (2002), Omara Portuondo appeared as a guest artist in some of the tracks.\n\nIn 2005 she celebrated her 30 years as a performing artist at the Palau de la Música Catalana, with a concert entitled 'Mis 30 años de amor al Arte', with which she is now touring Spain and other European countries.\n\nIn June 2006 she takes part in an homage tour for Leonard Cohen together with Martiriio, Kiko Veneno, Javier Colis and Luz Casal, with a Spanish version of \"Hey, That's no Way to Say Goodbye\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7713553", "text": "History of Sioux City, Iowa\n\nIowa is in the tallgrass prairie of the North American Great Plains, historically inhabited by speakers of Siouan languages.\nThe area of Sioux City, Iowa was inhabited by Yankton Sioux when it was first reached by Spanish and French furtrappers in the 18th century. \nIn 1803, during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, France sold a vast portion of central North America to the United States of America. This \"Louisiana Purchase\" was largely unexplored. Jefferson sent out the Corps of Discovery, under Lewis and Clark, to scientifically document the territory. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark expedition traveled up the Missouri and set-up camp near what would become Sioux City, Iowa. On August 20, a member of the expedition, Sgt. Charles Floyd died of \"bilous colic\" and was buried on a bluff overlooking the river. At the time of Lewis and Clark, the Omaha tribe of Native Americans were present just downstream from this region, and the Yankton Sioux were upstream. William Thompson established a trading post near Floyd's Bluff in 1848, and had early ambitions for founding a city. However, Thompson's hopes were never realized; settlers further upriver, between the Floyd and Big Sioux rivers, met with more success.\n\nTheophile Bruguier, a French-Canadian fur trader, is considered the first white settler on land that would become Sioux City. According to one legend, he told his friend Chief War Eagle of the Yankton Sioux about a dream he had regarding a rich land where two rivers joined near a high bluff. War Eagle told him that he knew of this land, near the mouth of the Big Sioux River. In reality, Bruguier had already passed this place many times in his voyages between Fort Pierre in the Dakota Territory and St. Louis, Missouri as an agent for the American Fur Company. In 1849, Bruguier established his farm on this same land; this farm included log cabins and tipis used by the family of War Eagle. Bruguier claimed all the land from the mouth of the Big Sioux River east along the Missouri River to near the Floyd River. In 1852 he sold the land from Perry Creek east to the Floyd River to Joseph Leonais. At about that time, Bruguier encouraged James A. Jackson, a fur trade outfitter from Council Bluffs (then Kanesville), to come upriver to establish a trading post. Jackson, in turn, convinced his father-in-law, Dr. John K. Cook, of the area’s potential as a future city; Cook, an English-born Oxford University-educated physician turned frontier surveyor, was most impressed by the location at the mouths of the Big Sioux and Floyd Rivers at the Missouri. In his official capacity as United States Federal Government surveyor, Dr. Cook established the little town of Sioux City in 1854, staking out its lots and streets. Joseph Leonais, who owned much of the land which would become the downtown area, sold it to Dr. Cook after much haggling for $3000. Within 3 years the new town had a population of 400 people and incorporated as a city.\n\nThe first steamboat arrived from St. Louis in June 1856, loaded with ready-framed houses and provisions.\n\nThe railroad first arrived in 1868. About that time a few small factories opened. In 1873, James Booge opened the first large-scale meatpacking plant and created a demand which ultimately led to the opening of the livestock yards (\"stockyards\") in 1884. The period from about 1880 to 1890 marked the most rapid and significant progress made thus far in Sioux City's development. In 1880 Sioux City had a population of 7,500.; in 1884, 15,514; in 1886, 22,358; in 1887, 30,842; and in 1890, 38,700. Street cars, water works, electric lights and other improvements appeared. Factories, jobbing houses, meatpacking plants, retail stores and railroads increasingly came on the scene. The city's building boom included an elevated railroad (the Sioux City Elevated Railway) and early \"skyscrapers\". These changes mirrored growth that was occurring nationwide, especially in the transition of small pioneer settlements to thriving urban centers. President Grover Cleveland visited in 1887, by then Fourth Street was the center of the business district.\n\nSioux City is also the birthplace of the Corn Palace, a temporary building made each year as part of the Corn Festival. The Sioux City Corn Palaces were large wooden buildings with corn cobs nailed to their walls. The first Corn Palace was built in 1887, and was designed by architect W.E. Loft. The Corn Palace became larger and grander every year. The last Sioux City Corn Palace, built in 1891, sprawled across the city’s downtown area. The palace had three towers, one of which stretched 200 feet tall. It also had a large tunnel, which allowed traffic to pass right beneath its center.\nBut bad weather brought a poor turnout for the 1891 Corn Festival, as the building was unheated. The Great Floyd River Flood of 1892 drowned any further hopes for the festival, and Corn Palaces were never built in Sioux City again.\n\nIn May 1892, heavy rains caused the Floyd River to rise, sending a destructive wave of muddy water through the unprepared city. At least three thousand people were left homeless. The stockyards and railroad lines were all badly damaged, and a lumber yard caught fire. The final death toll from drowning was twenty-five, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThe nationwide Financial Panic of 1893 resulted in number of real estate investors and entrepreneurs in Sioux City losing great paper fortunes. Edwin Peters, the developer and promoter of Morningside, claimed to have lost $1.5 million, only to be left with a debt of $7,000.\n\nIn 1898, all units of the Iowa National Guard—the 49th, 50th, 51st and 52nd Infantry Regiments, as well as artillery and cavalry units—were called to active duty in the War with Spain. The 49th and 50th entrained for South Florida but did not reach Cuba. The 51st was sent to the Philippines and engaged in combat action there. The 52nd remained stateside.\n\nThe beginning of the twentieth century saw a population of 33,000.\n\nIn 1900, on a high bluff overlooking the Missouri River, construction began on the 100' tall Floyd Monument, a stone obelisk honoring the burial site of Sgt. Charles Floyd. Floyd died near here while exploring the region with the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1804. The monument, which was completed in 1901, was later recognized by the U.S. Department of Interior as the First National Historic Landmark, in 1960.\n\nIn 1900, Sioux Cityans and the rest of the country were the victims of a fraud perpetrated by former Sioux City land speculator, developer, and (later) notorious wheeler-dealer John Peirce. Peirce was a colorful and flamboyant character, a decorated Union Army veteran wounded in the Civil War, and a major promoter during Sioux City's 19th Century boom years. Until fairly recently, Sioux City historians and civic promoters held Peirce in high esteem for his years of seeming dedication to the growth of Sioux City, especially of the North Side. More recent investigation has shown that in the end Peirce was a very clever scoundrel who actually got away with his crime. Like most other businessman, Peirce had been hurt very badly by the financial panic of 1893. While most of Sioux City's leading businessmen honorably spent years working and rebuilding to pay back their debts, Peirce began scheming for a way to bilk the public out of the funds he needed to effect his relocation to the west coast. In 1900, he initiated a nationwide lottery to dispose of his northside mansion (which later became the Sioux City Museum). About 40,000 tickets were sold at one dollar each. The drawing took place at the Union passenger depot on Christmas Eve of 1900. It was first announced that the winner was a jeweler from Vinton, Iowa. However, a few days later, it emerged that the winning ticket was actually held by a New York millionaire, William Barbour. (Peirce had owed a hefty financial debt to Mr. Barbour.) The abstract for the Peirce Mansion reveals that a warranty deed transferred title to Barbour nine days \"before\" the actual drawing and nineteen days before Barbour was publicly known to hold the winning lottery ticket. Barbour promptly sold the mansion to William Gordon, in exchange for bonds which were issued by the company operating the Combination Bridge. Peirce, a flamboyant figure to be sure, wrote an emotional goodbye to Sioux City in the newspaper before heading west. Peirce collected his money and disappeared from Sioux City forever.\n\nOn December 23, 1904, Sioux City suffered one of its greatest calamities when a fire broke out in the basement of the Pelletier Department Store on the southwest corner of Fourth and Jackson Streets. The fire ignited when a store employee lit a match in a Christmas toy display area of the basement floor to ignite a gas jet to illuminate the display. The head of the match flew off and landed in mounds of cotton that had been used to simulate snow drifts. The room went up like a torch, and the fire quickly spread throughout the multi-story building. The Sioux City Fire Department was neither manned nor equipped to suppress a rapidly spreading high-rise fire, whipped by wind gusts that quickly spread the flames to neighboring buildings. Two and a half blocks of the downtown district were gutted by fire. Only one person died in the catastrophe, but the loss in property was in the millions of dollars. Sioux City business investors lost little time in rebuilding the core business district.\n\nIn the winter of 1914, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) chose Sioux City as the site of one of its many free speech fights. The goal was to organize both industrial and agricultural farm laborers into one big union to pressure management for better wages and shorter hours. Some community leaders—notably the enlightened Pastor and future Populist Republican Mayor Wallace Mertin Short—strongly defended the rights of the workers to exercise free speech, while not endorsing or condoning the radical and often violent tactics of the IWW. As in all of the IWW free speech fights of that era, once word of such a demonstration went out over the \"bush telegraph,\" thousands upon thousands of unemployed men made their way into the city by foot or on freight cars. The center of activity was in the 800 block of Fourth Street, where Sioux City Police on horseback, assisted by Iowa National Guardsmen, engaged in skirmishing. Hundreds of unemployed laborers were arrested until, jails full, city fathers bodily expelled them aboard freight cars, which delivered them to isolated locations outside the city.\n\nWhen the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, Iowa had 3 National Guard regiments, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd. The 3rd Iowa was federalized immediately as the new 168th Infantry Regiment and became part of the new 42nd \"Rainbow\" Division made up of guard troops from 26 states. Organized and trained at Camp Mills, New York, the 42nd was the first American combat division to reach the front lines in France. After extensive advanced combat training under supervision of French officers for a period of 90 days, the 168th entered the front lines in February 1918. Many of the members of Company L were from Sioux City, Northwest Iowa and Southeast South Dakota.\n\nMeanwhile, Company L of the 2nd Iowa Infantry Regiment, made up of National Guardsmen primarily from Council Bluffs, Sioux City and other western Iowa communities, was ordered to Camp Dodge, Des Moines in May 1917. There the Company L men joined other companies of the 2nd Iowa drawn from across the state, After getting organized and equipped at Camp Dodge from May through August, the 2nd Iowa National Guard Regiment finally embarked by troop train for Camp Cody, Deming, New Mexico—one of 32 national army training cantonments.\n\nArriving at Cody in September 1917, the 2nd Iowa was sworn into federal service and on 28 September the old 2nd Iowa became the 133rd Infantry Regiment of the newly created 34th \"Sandstorm\" Division. The 34th remained in training at Camp Cody until late summer 1918, when it finally received orders to France. After a full year living and training in primitive and dust-storm conditions at this bleak desert outpost just 30 miles from the Mexican border, most of the men of the 133rd Infantry were happy to be headed overseas and desirous of getting into the fight. The division was held up at Ft. Dix, New Jersey for a couple of weeks due to the worldwide influenza pandemic, but ultimately most of the combat units of the division arrived safely in England and from there moved onward to Le Mans, France by October 1918. Upon arrival at Le Mans, the War Department determined that the 34th Division would not be needed on the Western Front and the entire division was disestablished. However, most of the infantrymen were assigned to casual detachments and sent to other army units at the front as replacements.\n\nBy this time the 168th Infantry, which had arrived in France eight months earlier, had spent 174 continuous days in combat and had suffered heavy casualties in repelling the German offensive of May 1918 and during the Meuse-Argonne counter-offensive that summer. Thus, many men from the 133rd Infantry were sent as replacements to the 168th infantry, and several of these were with the Rainbow Division in its final combat action of the war—the assault on Sedan 4–9 November 1918. Following the Armistice of 11 November, these same Sioux City soldiers also were part of the 168th Infantry's \"watch on the Rhine,\": being stationed at Niederzeissen, Germany, until 9 May 1919. Those men who had not returned from France immediately after the Armistice were finally shipped home from Germany, arriving at Camp Dodge on the 18th of May. The men received their discharges on 19 May 1919 and returned to Sioux City.\n\nIn addition to the 133rd and 168th Infantry regiments made up of Iowa National Guardsmen, hundreds more Sioux City men enlisted or were drafted into regular Army, Marine Corps and Navy units during the war.\n\nIn 1919, more than 1400 Sioux City veterans of the Great War gathered to form Monahan Post No. 64 of the American Legion, named in honor of Private Edward Monahan of Sioux City, who had been the first man of the 168th Infantry Regiment killed in action in France. Private Monahan, in addition to giving his life, had distinguished himself in combat, having been mentioned in dispatches and also having been posthumously awarded the French Croix de Guerre Medal with Palm by the French government.\n\nIn 1921, the city of Sioux City, in partnership with civic and veterans groups, designated a stretch of Stone Park Boulevard as the \"Memorial Mile\" by planting a tree to commemorate every Sioux City serviceman killed in the \"war to end all wars.\"\n\nA Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale University and author of several scholarly books, Congregationalist Minister Wallace Mertin Short was far and away the most educated individual ever to have held elected municipal office in Sioux City. After crossing swords over the issue of temperance with the national elders of the Congregationalist Church and being officially de-frocked as minister of that church's Sioux City congregation, Short rented a movie house on Fourth Street and founded a successful non-denominational church open to all. He appealed to the downtrodden and dregs of society and enjoyed rubbing elbows in Sioux City taverns with common laborers. The intellectual Short suffered from severe insomnia, and made no secret of the fact that he personally consumed 1 large glass of beer every evening to help him sleep. Such an admission from a man of the cloth was considered scandalous in the extreme in that time.\n\nShort nevertheless garnered sufficient backing from organized labor to win electoral office and he went on to serve three terms as Mayor, from 1918 to 1923. Now using the Mayor's office as his pulpit, Short became a powerful spokesman for the rights of the working man and of the ethnic minorities who made up a significant percentage of Sioux City's 70,000 citizens in 1918. He embraced the Industrial Workers of the World and spoke publicly on their behalf when thousands of them congregated in the city to wage a \"free speech\" fight in 1914. While Short's pro-union sentiments and actions over his career resulted in an incorrect and unfair legacy of \"socialist,\" Short was in fact a progressive Republican who possessed a deep sense of social justice and whose faith in the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights frequently put him at odds not only with fellow clergymen but also with the large industrialists of the city. At the same time, Mayor Short's sometimes naive faith in appointed members of his city administration resulted in several scandals for which he, as chief executive, must ultimately take the blame. For example, his friendship with local labor unions resulted in the appointment of an alcoholic union boss to head the city's Department of Public Safety during his first term. When the Rush building collapsed in 1918 killing 39 citizens (see below), this Public Safety Commissioner arrived on the scene of the disaster in an inebriated condition and started handing out whiskey to the city firefighters and policemen on rescue duty. This commissioner, who had previously served as boss of the Sign Painter's Union in Sioux City, had virtually no experience in law enforcement or public safety and was eventually dismissed from his post and run out of town, apparently by friends of Mayor Short.\n\nIf ever an elected representative championed Sioux City as a \"working man's town\" it was Wallace M. Short. Even before taking elected office, Short campaigned against the Temperance Movement and opposed Prohibition, not on moral grounds, but on the principal that alcohol consumption was a personal choice, and not something to be controlled or governed from Des Moines or Washington, D.C. Mayor Short remained a committed Republican for the remainder of his life and went on to hold office in the Iowa legislature until 1932, when the Democrats swept into office on the coat tails of Franklin Roosevelt. Although neither history nor the people of Sioux City treated the remarkable Wallace Short fairly, his administration of Sioux City during a decade of both turbulence and meteoric economic growth between 1918-1928 brought some of the best level-headed government policies that the City of Sioux City ever had...or will ever have. Sadly, not one street, building or park has ever been named in Wallace M. Short's honor.[See William H. Cumberland, Wallace Short, Iowa Rebel (Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University Press, 1983); and Wallace M. Short, Let There Be Light(Kansas City: The Hyde Park Press, 1916) (Martin Luther King, Jr, 1917)\n\nOn June 29, 1918, Sioux City suffered its greatest accidental loss of life when the four-story Ruff Pharmaceutical building (the Hedges Block at Fourth & Douglas Streets) collapsed. At the time of the disaster, workmen were gutting the upper floors and preparing to lower part of the first floor to ground level. Meanwhile, retail activities had been allowed to continue at street level. The building suddenly collapsed, trapping scores of victims in the rubble. Gas mains ruptured, causing a massive fire that required 36 hours to contain. In typical city government fashion of the day, the City Public Safety Commissioner arrived on the scene and handed out bottles of whiskey to firemen and other rescuers. Thirty-nine people died in what became known as \"the Ruff Disaster.\"\n\nThe population grew to 71,227 at the 1920 census, making Sioux City the 99th largest city in the United States. In 1932 and 1933 a farmers strike occupied the city for some time, preventing food shipments in protest of very low agricultural prices. National Guardsmen of the 133rd Infantry, based at Sioux City, were called into service for 2 weeks by the Governor to patrol the strike at Cherokee, Iowa.\n\nA major scandal erupted in Sioux City in 1935, two years after the Volstead Prohibition Act was repealed, when it was discovered that corrupt Iowa state officials—including the Iowa State Attorney General and leaders of the Iowa State Alcohol Control Board—were operating a profitable extortion scheme to offer \"protection\" to local Sioux City tavern owners in exchange for payoff money. The Attorney General was arrested, tried and convicted in the Woodbury County Courthouse. It seems that the legalization of alcohol only provided corrupt state officials waiting in the wings an opportunity to profit from Sioux City's profound love of alcoholic beverages—control over which had, until recently, been the sole domain of organized bootleggers.\n\nWith war clouds on the horizon in Europe, Companies L and M and the Howitzer Company (37mm antitank), 133rd Iowa Infantry Regiment were called to active federal service in 1941. Upon mobilization, the 133rd Infantry was made a part of the U.S. 34th (\"Red Bull\") Infantry Division, which had been deactivated by the War Department in October 1918. The Iowa guardsmen had participated in all-Army maneuvers at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana in 1940, and were among the first to be federalized. Companies L, M and the Howitzer Company, all from Sioux City, were among the first Americans sent to Europe when they landed in Londonderry, Northern Ireland early in the war. From Northern Ireland, the unit sailed for the Mediterranean Theater, where it saw its first combat in North Africa. In the first major U.S. offensive ground action against Germany in World War Two, the 34th Division was ambushed and badly mauled by German Panzer and mechanized infantry units at Kasserine Pass, Tunisia, in 1943. The division suffered horrendous casualties, including many POWs. Later reconstituted, the 34th saw subsequent combat in Italy.\n\nEarly in World War II, the U.S. Army established a major training base at Sioux City, located at Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, south of downtown. New, large runways were constructed to facilitate heavy bomber operations, and the Sioux City Army Air Base became one of the prime locations for B-17 heavy bomber basic flight qualification training as well as home to various support and maintenance units. Hollywood actor and Pilot-Captain (later Colonel) Jimmy Stewart was posted to Sioux City with his squadron in 1943, where he and his crew completed their initial B-17 qualification prior to deployment overseas. Just following the war, in December 1946, the 185th Iowa Air National Guard unit was established at Sioux City.\n\nOn December 14, 1949, the large Swift & Company packing house, located north of the Sioux City Stockyards and adjacent to the Floyd River channel, suddenly exploded, killing 21 Swift employees. The cause of the disaster was never fully confirmed, but the explosion was believed to have been caused by a leaking gas pipe.\n\nIn 1950 Sioux City had a population of about 84,000.\n\nIn the spring of 1952 the Missouri River rushed out of its banks and inundated downtown Sioux City. Many area communities were also flooded. It was in the aftermath of the 1952 flood that numerous cases of polio were reported in Sioux City and throughout the tri-state area. The polio epidemic hit this region of the country especially hard and lasted until vaccine was developed to combat the disease in the late 1950s.\n\nOn June 8, 1953, the Floyd River again flooded when a torrential downpour in the Sheldon, Iowa area sent a wall of water down into the lower valley. Fourteen people lost their lives. This flood was a major impetus for the Floyd River flood control project, including the building of a straightened, rock-lined channel and high levee through the city. The flood-prone \"South Bottoms\" neighborhood was razed for this project in 1962.\n\nIn 1962 Sioux City was named an All America City by the National Civic League.\n\nThe Sioux City Chamber and other leading civic groups organized River Cade, a week-long celebration of Summer and Sioux City history in 1964. The event has been held along the Missouri River front ever since, marked by an official street parade, a carnival, boat races, children's events and a grand ball.\n\nIn 1967, with the Vietnam War escalating under the Johnson Administration, the U.S Naval Reserve Construction Battalion (SEABEEs), based at Sioux City Naval Reserve Training Center, was called to active duty and deployed as part of Naval Construction Battalion (NCB) 2 to Danang, South Vietnam. These Sioux City Navy men frequently served under direct enemy sniper and artillery fire while engaged in building bases for the Navy and Marine Corps in the Danang area during their 13-month deployment. They served bravely, suffered casualties and returned with honor to their peacetime jobs as Sioux City construction men.\n\nIn February 1968, in direct response to the seizure by North Korea of a U.S. Navy surveillance vessel off the coast of North Korea, the 185th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Iowa Air National Guard, based in Sioux City, was activated for federal service. The squadron deployed to Phu Cat Air Base, Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). Members of the unit served with distinction in combat during their 12-month overseas deployment. The 185th suffered both killed in action and missing in action casualties before inactivation and return to Sioux City.\n\nLikewise in 1968, Headquarters & Headquarters Company, along with Company L, 133rd Infantry, Iowa National Guard based at Sioux City, were also placed on alert and sent into federal service at Fort Carson Colorado following the Pueblo Incident. Although anxious to deploy overseas as a fighting unit, the Iowa Guard troops—like their grandfathers of World War One—were sent to Vietnam piecemeal, as replacement troops. Some members of the Guard, including Military Policemen, deployed to South Korea. At least three Sioux City Guard members were killed in action in Vietnam during the war.\n\nThe 1970s witnessed a second, decade of urban renewal in downtown Sioux City. (see the \"South Bottoms\"). (See \"Historic Fourth Street\"). It took nearly another decade to rebuild the area. Many buildings were torn down, some dating back to the 1800s. Although there was some criticism of redevelopment, this was typical in many areas with urban renewal, losing old and sometimes historic buildings.\n\nLabor unrest erupted yet again in Sioux City in the early 1970s with a series of strikes by union meatcutters, laborers and allied trades against the Iowa Beef Processor (IBP) Dakota City, Nebraska plant. After years of fruitless negotiations, management finally locked out union laborers, erected a shanty town of cinderblock houses on the company compound and imported Mexican laborers. This act, and the concurrent departure of the Zenith TV manufacturing plant, served as a wake-up call to the Woodbury County Labor Council, which had wielded considerable political power in its defense of Sioux City's primarily blue-collar citizenry for generations. The streamlining of meat production processes—as pioneered by IBP Corporation—and the amalgamation of job tasks, revolutionized the industry in a way that would have major repercussions for Sioux City. Within 30 years, the meatpacking industry—the industry that virtually \"built\" Sioux City—would all but disappear within the boundaries of Sioux City, and along with it the once-dominant Sioux City Stockyards. \"Clean\" industries, including manufacturing of computers, would emerge to take its place. This not only changed the culture and attitudes of city residents but demographics as well. While this was a traumatic industrial transition, most residents would agree that the changes have been very healthy for a city that was once black-balled by business developers as a tough, strike-prone, unskilled blue collar, pro-labor town. This is not to denigrate the contributions of Labor, which won many basic working rights for all Americans in several landmark strikes in Sioux City in the first half of the 20th Century. But the influx of multinational corporations like IBP, and the formation and rapid growth of Gateway Computer, brought about corporate business philosophies and global outlooks that have clearly transformed Sioux City into a cleaner and less violent city.\n\nOn July 28, 1986 an F4 tornado struck areas just west and south of Sioux City, destroying one of the four power generation plants at Port Neal, six miles (10 km) south of the Sioux City airport. No one was killed and the tornado avoided heavily populated areas.\n\nOn July 19, 1989 a Douglas DC-10 carrying United Airlines flight 232 crashed at the Sioux Gateway Airport killing 111 passengers and one flight attendant. But due to efforts by the pilot and his crew, 185 on board survived. The airport had a full-time Air National Guard base located on it that provided 'First Recovery' fire fighters and approx 200 air guardsmen to aid in the search for survivors in the fields of corn surrounding the main fuselage section of the aircraft. They were further aided by the advanced disaster training that the city had recently completed for its emergency workers. This event was memorialized in a made-for-TV movie \"Crash Landing - the Rescue of Flight 232\" starring Charlton Heston as Captain Al Haynes in 1991.\n\nIn 1990, due to its rescue efforts and compassion of its citizens in the Flight 232 disaster, Sioux City was again named an All America City by the National Civic League.\n\nOn December 13, 1994, an explosion killed four and injured 18 at the Terra International ammonium nitrate plant at Port Neal. The explosion released a cloud of anhydrous ammonia into the air and leaked nitric acid into the ground. The incident forced emergency evacuations in nearby areas such as Salix. The toxic cloud stayed south of Sioux City.\n\nThe urban renewal of downtown during the 1970s has lost much of its impact due to suburban development, including the Southern Hills Mall. Department store J. C. Penney, moved from their downtown location in Sioux City, which opened in 1975 moved into Target's former location in 2004. The Sioux City Public Museum is renovating the building, moving from the undersized historic Pierce Mansion. In 2007, another department store, Younkers closed their location in downtown Sioux City, only choosing to operate in Southern Hills Mall. Hom Furniture has moved into this space from a much smaller store in Sioux City.\n\nRedevelopment has occurred in downtown Sioux City with the restoration of The Orpheum Theatre, which had been simply used as a movie theatre since the 1960s, until funding to restore it began in the mid-1990s. Tyson Events Center opened in 2003, replacing the 53-year-old Sioux City Municipal Auditorium, which is now a recreation center. In 2004, a 14 screen movie theatre opened, and included of retail space. The movie theatre has been profitable, however the retail space is almost completely vacant, and the building could face foreclosure.\n\nIn 2005, Sioux City, along with Coon Rapids and Clinton, was awarded one of the inaugural Iowa Great Places designations. One of the major events that occurred in Sioux City in the 2010s was the addition of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino which attracts a lot of big acts and is a main feature of the Sioux City area for the present time.\n", "id": "7713553", "categories": ["Histories of cities in Iowa"], "title": "History of Sioux City, Iowa"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7713561", "text": "Battle Fantasia\n\nThe game is notable for its stylistic departure from many fighting games, and is set in a fantasy world depicted as a storybook, and borrows many superficial elements from role-playing games including damage represented as numbers and a text-heavy story mode, which involves a number of heroes answering the call to battle to stop an evil force from once again attempting to destroy the world. \"Battle Fantasia\" met with relatively low sales in Japan and received mixed to average reviews from critics.\n\n\"Battle Fantasia\" is a traditional versus fighting game where up to two players compete against each other in combat using a variety of characters each with their own special attacks and fighting styles. While the game uses three-dimensional graphics for characters, they are restricted to a two-dimensional battle area that only allows them to move back and forth or up into the air. Players face each other in best-of-three round battles that involve the use of normal attacks, throws, and special moves that often involve combinations of button presses and directional input, which can be strung together in long combo strings. The game features four main attack buttons - two punches and two kicks - as well as a fifth \"Gachi\" (ガチ lit. \"elegance\" or \"grace\") button used to parry incoming attacks. If a player times a Gachi command just as an opponent's attack lands, it negates all damage and allows the player to counterattack in a brief time frame. The button can also be used to push an opponent back when combined with a direction, as well as allow the player to recover faster from a knock-down.\n\nAs players deal and receive damage, they add to their MP Gauge located at the bottom of the screen, which can be stocked to a maximum of three levels. Players can expend MP to activate \"Heat Up\" mode to increase their strength and add additional effects to their attacks, with specific enhancements differing with each character. The gauge also allows characters to unleash powerful super moves which cause heavy damage but require spending one gauge level to activate, and can be strung together with special moves with proper timing resulting in a Super Cancel combination. Matches are won either when a player depletes their opponent's health bar, or when the time limit of each round runs out, resulting in a win for the player with the most remaining vitality. The amount of health is different for each character, and is represented by numerical hit points under each health bar.\n\n\n\"Battle Fantasia\" was developed by Arc System Works originally as a Japanese arcade game beginning in 2006. The company had previously been known for their work on the popular \"Guilty Gear\" fighting game series and was looking for ways to expand their market to a more general audience, and appointed character illustrator Emiko Iwasaki as the project's director, one of only a few women to rise to that position in the Japanese game industry. The game was the company's first title developed for the Taito Type X² arcade board hardware, and was the first game to use Taito's Vewlix arcade cabinet, which allowed the game to run in high-definition 720p resolutions. Although Iwasaki was given a large degree of freedom when making the game, she was encouraged by the company to retain many features from the \"Guilty Gear\" franchise in order to maintain their core audience, as well as being told that the game \"needed\" to use three-dimensional graphics in order to develop the company's 3D talent, as well as more efficiently utilize the Type X² hardware. Stylistically, the game was a departure from Arc System Works' earlier games, with \"Battle Fantasia\"s colorful fantasy art direction chosen due to the popularity of role-playing games in Japan, which was overseen by graphic designer Junya Motomura. Gameplay was also made simpler when compared to other games in the genre in an attempt to bring more people into fighting games, as well expand it to the female demographic. Early beta versions of \"Battle Fantasia\" began public location tests in select arcades across Japan in October 2006, with further tests conducted over the next few months until the game's official release in April 2007.\n\nA home console version of \"Battle Fantasia\" was announced in a February 2008 issue of Japanese \"Weekly Famitsu\" magazine, and was confirmed for release for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems. The console releases would feature a number of new play modes, including a new, single-player story mode unique to each character, and online play over Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live. In order to make the game more competitive, tweaks and balance changes were enacted to the game's roster, and exploits such as infinite combos were removed entirely. On May 1, a playable demo version of the game was released for the Japanese PlayStation Network, with a full commercial release for both consoles on May 29.\n\nIn a July 2008 press panel, Aksys Games announced that it would be bringing \"Battle Fantasia\" to North America the following September, but only for the Xbox 360. When asked about the possibility of a PlayStation 3 version, a representative remarked that \"We’re looking into it, but right now it’s just 360.\" In an interview with website Gamasutra, when asked if a North American PlayStation 3 version was rejected by Sony Computer Entertainment America, Arc System Works producer Kouki Sadamori merely replied that the question was \"a tough one to answer...\" 505 Games signed on as the game's European publisher, who released both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions in the region simultaneously in March 2009. \"Battle Fantasia\"s late release in the region was attributed to the subject of incest being discussed during certain character's Story Mode cutscenes, which prompted the publisher to remove many alternative story paths from the game mode. The game saw a very limited release in only a few selected countries, and was originally indented to be a GBP£25 budget title, but rose to £40 after the game became exclusive to European game retailer GAME. One year after the announcement that the game would only come to North America for the Xbox 360, Aksys Games announced that it would be releasing \"Battle Fantasia\" as a full download title on the PlayStation Network in Fall 2009, with project lead Frank deWindt stating that \"The fans have been asking for it and we're here to deliver.\" In addition to the announcement, the company also held a contest on their official website for fans to name five new PlayStation Network achievement trophies added especially for the new release, which was made available on Sony's PlayStation Store on December 22, 2009.\n\nA new version of the game, called the \"\"Revised Edition\"\", was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam on July 7, 2015. It features an updated game balance.\n\nThe home console versions of \"Battle Fantasia\" received relatively low sales in Japan, with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions selling 3,100 and 2,300 copies respectively during their debut week. \"Famitsu\" also gave both console versions 25 out of 40, while \"Famitsu Xbox360\" gave the Xbox 360 version 29 out of 40.\n\nWestern response to \"Battle Fantasia\" was mostly average, with the game receiving \"mixed or average reviews\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Many critics compared the title to Arc System Works' previous fighting game endeavor, the \"Guilty Gear\" series, with \"1UP.com\" declaring that the game was more simplistic than the company's earlier works with less focus on technical aspects such as combos, and that each characters special moves were \"flashy and not as situational\". The website felt that many of the changes resulted in the characters being more interesting, and called the game's fantasy art motif \"a pleasing sidestep\" from \"Guilty Gear\"s more \"edgy\" style, but found that most matches were slow and that the colorful art direction and Japanese voices would only appeal to a niche audience. \"Game Informer\" declared that the presentation of \"Battle Fantasia\" was charming \"with all the vibrancy and artistic style of an anime\", yet it did little to revolutionize the genre despite adding traditional role-playing game aesthetics such as \"long-winded story segments\". IGN called the game's character design \"lighthearted and appealing\", but that the total cast size of only twelve playable characters was relatively small compared to other fighting games, and that background designs were \"oftentimes bland and ugly\". In regards to the game's technical aspects, IGN felt the game lacking when compared to more high-profile titles such as Sega's \"Virtua Fighter 5\", and that gameplay was more about \"timing and calculated moves than massive combos or memorizing deep move sets\". \"Anime News Network\" ranked it fourth on their list of video games that \"deserved far more attention than they received\", saying what \"sets it apart is the look\" of the backgrounds and characters.\n\nEuropean versions of \"Battle Fantasia\" in early 2009 were often compared to Capcom's highly anticipated \"Street Fighter IV\" released just one month after. \"Eurogamer\" claimed that the game was \"not even in the same league as Capcom's superlative re-envisioning\", yet compared its defensive Gachi parrying system to \"Street Fighter III\". The website would criticize the title's \"by-the-numbers gameplay\" and lack of online competition, and called \"Battle Fantasia\"s art style \"a nice departure, but many will find the overly twee presentation a bit too sugary for their fighter tastes.\" \"Play UK\" also commented on the game's release, stating that \"Six months ago we would have happily recommended it as a stopgap to \"Street Fighter IV\", but we just can’t say that now.\" Journalists for the magazine would pan the title's lack of gameplay options and called the story mode \"a joke.\" Ironically, though it was often found to be inferior to \"Street Fighter IV\", series director Yoshinori Ono cited the original arcade version of \"Battle Fantasia\" in 2007 as the inspiration for his game's new three-dimensional art style, stating \"Our fear was that with Street Fighter IV, because our characters are taller and more human-proportioned that it might look funky... What we learned through development was that no, it's not going to look weird... Battle Fantasia was part of what made us realize that, I think.\"\n\n", "id": "7713561", "categories": ["Multiplayer and single-player video games", "505 Games", "Arc System Works games", "Versus fighting games", "Fantasy video games", "NESiCAxLive games", "Arcade games", "2007 video games", "Video games developed in Japan", "PlayStation Network games", "PlayStation 3 games", "Video games with 2.5D graphics", "Xbox 360 games", "Video games with cel-shaded animation"], "title": "Battle Fantasia"}

Besides research, teaching and practicing psychotherapy in Basel, Lüscher worked for international companies, amongst other things giving color advice. His book \"The Lüscher Test\" has been translated into more than 30 languages.\n\nMax Lüscher was born in Basel, Switzerland on September 9, 1923. After receiving his Swiss \"Matura\", comparable to a diploma, he focused on studying psychiatry and achieved his doctorate in the areas of philosophy, psychology, and the philosophy of law. Lüscher completed his dissertation on \"\"Color as an aid in psychological diagnosis\"\". This project was chosen as the \"summa cum laude\" by his professors. After this, working as a psychotherapist, Lüscher created his first color test which was published in 1947. This test used color cards to determine the current emotional state of the test-taker. From 1961 to 1965, Lüscher lived in Berlin and continued his career as a psychotherapist. Lüscher was noted for his guest lectures and training seminars for physicians.

Numbers are printed on the backside of each card, and after the test-taker orders them, the examiner turns them over and references an accompanying book that contains all of the different number combinations and their meaning. Lüscher argues that the subject's choice of color shows the state of their psychosomatic and emotional status and how they feel about themselves.\n\nLüscher relates to his four fundamental colors to the following fundamental categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nA 1984 comparison of the Lüscher color test and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory found little agreement between the two tests, prompting the authors to urge cautious use of the former.\n\n\n", "id": "7713579", "categories": ["Psychodynamics", "Psychology writers", "1923 births", "21st-century philosophers", "Swiss psychologists", "2017 deaths", "20th-century Swiss  philosophers", "Psychoanalytic theory", "Swiss psychiatrists"], "title": "Max Lüscher"}

In October, the Australians played additional matches in the USA and Canada on their return journey. The tour followed one made by an England team to Australia in 1876–77, during which the first matches retrospectively given Test match status were played. None of the 1878 matches had international status, nevertheless the tour proved to be such an outstanding financial and sporting success that the future of international cricket was assured.\n\nThe Australian team was managed by John Conway and captained by Dave Gregory. William Gibbes, who was a non-player, acted as the team's assistant-manager and secretary. Conway was a journalist from Geelong, Victoria while Gregory and Gibbes were both Sydney-based accountants working for the New South Wales Public Service. These three cricket enthusiasts were the architects of the venture. They and the players each contributed the sum of £50 to finance the expedition and later shared equally in the handsome profits that their enterprise generated, having carted the match takings around with them in a closely guarded strong-box all the time that they were away.\n\nGregory demonstrated excellent leadership and tactical skills throughout the long tour, while Fred Spofforth became the star performer of the team. Cricket scholars consider him to have been one of the greatest fast bowlers in the history of the game.\n\nDuring the English tour of Australia in 1876–77, the Australian all-rounder and impresario John Conway met the English captain James Lillywhite in Melbourne and discussed the potential profitability of an Australian team visiting England. Lillywhite agreed to take soundings at home and see if the major English teams would consider hosting a team of \"the best cricketers in the colonies\". During the 1877 English season, Lillywhite made enquiries and was encouraged by the feedback. He contacted Conway to report interest and, with the possibility of \"good money\", offered to arrange a fixture list. Conway negotiated with Dave Gregory who had captained the \"Combined XI from Sydney and Melbourne\" against Lillywhite's professionals in what latterly became recognised as the first two Test matches. It was agreed that the players would form a private company by contributing £50 each to cover expenses, profits to be shared accordingly although Conway as manager would take 7.5% of gross proceeds.\n\nThe team sailed from Sydney on 29 March 1878 in the , reaching San Francisco on 27 April, having called at Auckland and Honolulu \"en route\". They then traveled across America by train, a potentially hazardous undertaking in the era of the James–Younger Gang and others, though Frank and Jesse James were still in hiding after the abortive Northfield Raid in 1876. The Australians sailed from New York on 4 May in the , which docked at Liverpool on 13 May. The team caught the train to Nottingham and arrived there at 12:15 on 14 May to a large reception. On 20 May, they began their first match at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe Australian party was composed of: J. Conway (Victoria; manager), W. C. V. Gibbes (assistant-manager), D. W. Gregory (New South Wales; captain), F. E. Allan (Victoria), G. H. Bailey (Tasmania), A. C. Bannerman (New South Wales), C. Bannerman (New South Wales), J. McC. Blackham (Victoria; wicket-keeper), H. F. Boyle (Victoria), T. W. Garrett (New South Wales), T. P. Horan (Victoria), W. E. Midwinter (Victoria), W. L. Murdoch (New South Wales) and F. R. Spofforth (New South Wales). Midwinter was already in England and joined the team in Nottingham for their opening game.\n\n\"27 May\". MCC \"versus\" Australians at Lord's. The Australians established their reputation for all time by a nine wicket victory inside five hours in one of the most sensational games in history. A strong MCC team, led by W. G. Grace himself, was bowled out for 33 (Spofforth 6-4, including a hat trick) and though they in turn dismissed the Aussies for 41 (Shaw 5-10, Morley 5-31), MCC in their second innings were out for just 19 (Boyle 5-3, Spofforth 5-16). The Australians needed 12 to win, which was a substantial total in the conditions, but they lost only their star batsman Charles Bannerman in getting them. Spofforth's match analysis was 14.3 overs, five maidens, 20 runs, 11 wickets. This match inspired Punch to publish the following verse:\n\n\"20 – 22 June\". Middlesex \"versus\" Australians at Lord's and Surrey \"versus\" Gloucestershire at The Oval. Shortly before play was due to begin at Lord's, WG Grace and others of the Gloucestershire camp turned up and effectively \"nabbed\" Billy Midwinter, taking him to the Oval to play for Gloucestershire. Midwinter had played for them in 1877 and Grace argued that he was bound to continue if required. Since Gloucestershire had arrived at the Oval with only ten players, Midwinter most definitely was required.\n\nA dispute ensued and all sorts of agreements and contractual arrangements were argued over. It seems that WG was at first rude and insulting, then tried to brazen it out before offering a guarded apology and eventually getting around to his favourite topic: money. Midwinter apparently did quite well out of it all despite being anything but an innocent party. The Aussies got some satisfaction when they beat Middlesex by 98 runs without Midwinter while Gloucestershire, with Midwinter, lost by 16 runs to Surrey. But the real revenge came later.\n\n\"5 – 6 Sept\". Gloucestershire \"versus\" Australians (Clifton College). Australians won by 10 wkts. This was the champion county's only home defeat of the season. All three Graces were playing but not Midwinter. Aussie revenge was complete thanks to a 12-90 match haul by the Demon, though he did not get WG's wicket.\n\n\"11 – 12 Sept\". Players \"versus\" Australians at Prince's Ground ended the Australian tour and was also the last time Prince's Ground (in Chelsea) was used as a first-class venue, Middlesex having moved to Lord's in 1877.\n\nAt the end of their tour, the Australians sailed from Liverpool on 18 September in the . They arrived in New York over a week later and went on to Philadelphia where they played the Philadelphian cricket team on 3–5 October at the Germantown Ground. This match, which is now unofficially rated first-class, was disrupted by disputes and walk-offs before it ended in a draw. The tourists played five other games, all minor fixtures, in Hoboken, Toronto, Montreal, St Louis and San Francisco. They sailed from San Francisco on 28 October in the , arriving in Sydney on 25 November after being away for almost eight months.\n\nAncillary note: In San Francisco, the Australian team had played a California XXII side composed of members from the Occidental and Oakland Cricket Clubs. The Oakland club was the first cricket team established on the East Bay, which became home to several cricket teams between 1878 and 1913. This was the first time a California side played an Australian national side.\n\nMeanwhile, back in England, the Graces endured months of controversy about the payments they received as supposed amateurs, much of which had come to light as a result of the Midwinter affair. Charges were brought against them at a stormy meeting of the Gloucestershire club's members and they were vilified in the press. In the end, little came of it. The Graces had too much influence. WG was simply too popular to be challenged and EM as a coroner was seen to be a \"pillar of the community\". So, although their ears burned, they escaped censure and nothing much changed.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7713585", "categories": ["English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889", "1878 in English cricket", "1878 in American sports", "Canadian cricket in the 19th century", "1878 in Australian cricket", "United States cricket in the 19th century", "1878 in Canada", "Australian cricket tours of North America", "International cricket competitions from 1844 to 1888", "Australian cricket tours of England"], "title": "Australian cricket team in England and North America in 1878"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7713618", "text": "Krabat (novel)\n\nKrabat is a fantasy novel about the eponymous Sorbian folk hero, written by Otfried Preußler. The book deals primarily with black magic and the lure of evil. Other themes include friendship, love, and death. It won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis (\"Prize for Literature for Young People\") in 1972.\n<br>\n\nThe book was first published in 1971 and in an English translation first as \"The Satanic Mill\" from 1972 to 1991, then republished in 2000 as \"The Curse of the Darkling Mill\", in 2011 as \"Krabat\" and in 2014 as \"Krabat and the Sorcerer's Mill\".\n\nSet in the mid 17th century during the Thirty Years' War, the story follows the life of Krabat, a 14-year-old Wendish beggar boy living in the eastern part of Saxony. For three consecutive nights, he is called to a watermill near the village Schwarzkollm through a dream. Upon heeding the call and arriving at the mill, he begins his apprenticeship as a miller's man. He soon joins the secret brotherhood, composed of journeymen and apprentices, and discovers that the skill he is meant to learn through this apprenticeship is Black Magic. The first magic powers Krabat acquires are rather harmless, such as the ability to turn himself into a raven. Other peculiarities of this watermill include the lack of any outside visitors, including farmers who would have brought grain. The only visitor to the mill is one Goodman, who may be the devil, although this is never made explicit.\n\nThe senior journeyman Tonda, Krabat's best friend and older brother figure, dies, ostensibly of an accident, on New Year's Eve in Krabat's first year at the mill. Tonda offers strangely little resistance to his own death. Krabat's suspicions of foul play are further reinforced when another journeyman and friend, Michal, dies the following New Year's Eve. He soon realizes that the master is bound in a pact to the Goodman: the master must sacrifice one journeyman every year on New Year's Eve, or perish himself.\n\nWishing to take revenge for his friends' death, Krabat secretly trains to increase his magical strength so he can fight the master. His quest is aided by a girl from the nearby village, a church singer, “Kantorka”, whose name is never mentioned (“Kantorka” meaning just ‘little chorister’). Krabat learns that to end the spell, his lover must challenge the master for him; then whoever loses the challenge, the master or the two lovers, will die. The master offers Krabat another solution: He will retire and let Krabat inherit the mill, along with the pact to the Goodman; but Krabat refuses to perpetuate the evil pact. So the challenge goes ahead, and the girl's task is to distinguish Krabat from the rest of the journeymen, all of them are standing in a row, while she is blindfolded. She manages to pick him out by the fact that he fears mainly for her life, while the others fear mainly for their own. Ultimately, she rescues Krabat from death, and they and the journeymen escape the mill. The master is left to die in the burning mill on New Year's Eve, while the survivors lose all their magic powers and are now simple millers who have to provide for themselves through normal hard work.\n\nThe characters of this novel provide a stark distinction between good and evil. Krabat, his love interest Kantorka, Tonda, Juro and Michal stand for the side of the good, whereas the master of the mill, the Goodman and the one journeyman who betrays his brothers stand for the bad. There are, however, a few journeymen who are indifferent or ambiguous to the ongoing struggle, and who neither support nor oppose the master.\n\nAlthough the story is quite close to the original Sorbian tale of Krabat that dates back to the 18th century, Preußler himself also considered it to tell the story of himself, his generation, and all young people who encounter power and its temptations and get ensnarled by it.\n\nThe story was adapted into a 1977 Czech animated film, \"Čarodějův učeň\" (\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\"), directed by Karel Zeman.\n\nThe band ASP started with a musical version of the story, in 12 parts, in 2006. In 2008 they finished the project with a 15-track album (on two CDs) called \"Zaubererbruder\" (i.e. \"Sorcerer-Brother\").\n\nMarco Kreuzpaintner's film adaptation of Otfried Preußler's book, also named \"Krabat\", was released in Germany on October 9, 2008.\n\nThe 1975 television film \"Die schwarze Mühle\" is based on a different novelization of the same folk tale by Jurij Brězan.\n\nKrabat is also the main character of three novels, written by the Sorbian writer Jurij Brězan, published in 1968, 1976 and 1993.\n\n", "id": "7713618", "categories": ["Works based on folklore", "Novels set in Germany", "German novels adapted into films", "German fantasy novels", "Fiction about magic", "1971 German novels", "Sorbian culture"], "title": "Krabat (novel)"}

His father was one of the chief authorities on the Talmud in Germany; hundreds of Talmudists, among them naturally his son, were his pupils. Landau left Germany and settled in Italy, living first in Pavia (1480) and then in Naples (1487).\n\nIn Naples, some time between 1487 and 1492, he published his code \"\"Agur\".\" He composed this for his pupil Ezra Abraham b. David Obadiah, because, the latter's time being devoted to physics and metaphysics, he could not enter deeply into the study of the Talmud (see introduction to \"Agur\"). This practical consideration determined the form of the \"Agur\", which contains only those rules that a layman should know, and comprises principally an abridged presentation of the material treated in the first and second parts of the \"Turim\". The author of the \"Turim\", Jacob ben Asher, is Landau's chief authority, and the \"Agur\" may be considered really as a supplement to that work. In the \"Agur\", Landau gives excerpts from the halakhic literature which appeared after the time of Jacob ben Asher.\n\nAlthough the \"Agur\" possesses little originality, it held an important position among law codes, and is often quoted, especially by Joseph Caro in the Shulchan Aruch. German influence on the religious practices of the Italians was increased by Landau's work, such authorities as Jacob Mölin, Isserlein, and other Germans having been little noticed by Italians before him. The \"Agur\" was the first Jewish work to contain a rabbinical approbation, besides being the second Hebrew book printed during the author's lifetime (see Jew. Encyc. ii. 27, s.v. Approbation).\n\nAt the end of the \"Agur\", Landau gave a number of conundrums relating to halakhah, under the title \"Sefer Chazon,\" which were afterward published separately (Venice, 1546; Prague, 1608).\n\n", "id": "7713622", "categories": ["15th-century Italian rabbis", "German rabbis", "1493 deaths", "Rishonim", "15th-century rabbis"], "title": "Jacob ben Judah Landau"}

During his NASA career, he worked as a flight director and planner. When he returned to NASA in the 1980s, he worked as a manager on the Space Station Freedom project, which later became the International Space Station. He also served as an administrator at the United States Department of Transportation.\n\nHodge was born in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex in 1929, and attended Minchenden Grammar School in Southgate, London. He studied at the Northampton Engineering College at the University of London, graduating in 1949 with a first-class degree in engineering. From 1950 through 1952 he worked as an engineer at Vickers-Armstrong in Weybridge. Upon graduation, Hodge worked as an engineer for the Aerodynamics Department of Vickers-Armstrongs. In 1952 Hodge took a job at the Avro Arrow project in Canada, where he was head of the air loads section.\n\n When the Avro Arrow project was cancelled in 1959, 32 Avro engineers including Hodge followed the lead of Jim Chamberlin and migrated to join NASA's Space Task Group. The group, based at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, was responsible for America's manned space program, Project Mercury. At Langley, Hodge became the assistant to Chris Kraft, who was the head of the Space Task Group's operations division and NASA's first flight director.\n\nDuring John Glenn's historic mission, the first orbital flight by an American, Hodge was serving as the flight director at NASA's tracking station in Bermuda.\n\nThe final flight in the Mercury program, MA-9, was scheduled to last long enough that a second flight director was needed in Mission Control. Thus, in 1963, Hodge became a flight director, choosing blue as his team color. The missions that he worked included Gemini 8, where he was the first person other than Kraft to be lead flight director for a mission.

As part of a deal with the Luxembourg government to open Europe's first polyester film plant in the country the American conglomerate DuPont requested that its employees have access to an American-style education for their children. Classes were first located in the dining room of a private home in Strassen, before moving, in early 1963, to a single classroom at a primary school in Cessange. Soon after, the Luxembourg government offered to the school classrooms at Servais House at the junction of Avenue Maria-Teresa and Boulevard Joseph II, where the school remained for six years.\n\nSeeing the school as a draw for other international firms, the Luxembourg government continued to support its development. In 1969, it gave the school access to a new building on rue Aloyse Kayser, in Belair. The same year it was taken over by international firm Goodyear and renamed the English Speaking School of Luxembourg.\n\nIn 1972, with student numbers growing, the school moved to the premises of the Lycée Michel Rodange in Hollerich, where it took the name the American School of Luxembourg and became a not-for-profit organisation. From 1977 to 1999 the school was located at 188 Avenue de la Faiencerie in Limpertsberg, where it adopted the name, the American International School of Luxembourg. \n\nIn 1999, the school settled into its current purpose built location in Hollerich on the Campus Geesseknäppchen, which hosts several other Luxembourg-based educational establishments. That same year the school adopted its present name, the International School of Luxembourg.\n\nThe school is divided into a lower school and upper school. \n\nThe lower school consists of an Early Years Programme serving children aged 3-7, which includes the Preschool, Kindergarten and Grade 1, whilst the rest of the lower school programme serves ages 7-11 in Grades 2-5.\n\nThe upper school consists of a middle school of Grades 6-8, serving ages 11-14, and a high school comprising Grades 9-12 serving ages 14-18.\n\n, ISL's student body consists of approximately 1,300 students representing close to 50 nationalities. On average, students remain enrolled in the school for between 3 to 5 years.\n\nISL is a member of the Northwest European Council of International Schools (NECIS) Sports Council, which coordinates varsity athletics competitions amongst its members. ISL fields teams in football, basketball, track and field, swimming, volleyball and rugby. The team goes by the name of the Eagles.\n\nThe International School of Luxembourg participates in and manages the Global Issues Network.\n\nSince 1991, ISL has hosted the Japanese Supplementary School in Luxembourg (ルクセンブルグ補習授業校 \"Rukusenburugu Hoshū Jugyō Kō\"), a Japanese supplementary school\nfor students aged 6–15.\n\n\nISL Homepage\n", "id": "7713666", "categories": ["American international schools", "Schools in Luxembourg City"], "title": "International School of Luxembourg"}

Typically a drying tube is 1–2 cm wide and 5–10 cm long and bent at an angle of about 90 degrees. In use, the drying tube is filled with a rechargeable desiccant such as calcium chloride, and the open end of drying tube is partially blocked (e.g. with wool, glasswool or a bung/cork which has a small bore made in it) and the drying tube is connected to the apparatus to be kept dry via the ground glass joint. If the drying tube is bent the bend is oriented so that solid desiccant does not fall into the reaction vessel. Some drying tubes have a glass sinter to prevent desiccant falling into the reaction vessel. Drying tubes are often prepared in advance and the desiccant can be replaced when exhausted.\nReactions which are being heated, or which evolve gases, must never be sealed because an overpressure may shatter the vessel. Drying tubes are usually fitted on top of the reflux condenser, allowing the pressure to be relieved while excluding atmospheric moisture.\n\nDrying tubes are often used in less-demanding applications, typically in organic syntheses. While the reaction is often carried out at room temperature, the solvent, usually volatile diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran is already able to displace air directly, making additional measures to exclude atmospheric moisture less important.\n\nAn oil bubbler may be a useful substitute. In this case, gases are allowed to escape, but air is not able to enter because the bubbler acts as a one-way valve. Oil bubblers can tolerate an underpressure in the reaction vessel. Oil is sucked into a sump in lieu of air. However, if the pressure in the reaction vessel falls too low, the oil may be sucked into the reaction vessel, contaminating it.\n\nFor more demanding applications, a Schlenk line or glovebox may be used to provide an atmosphere of dry, inert gas such as argon or nitrogen.\n", "id": "7713669", "categories": [], "title": "Drying tube"}

Gray nominated his earlier description of \"Kangurus pencillatus\" as the type species, now recognised in the combination \"Petrogale penicillata\" (brush-tail rock-wallaby). The author separated the species from the defunct genus \"Kangurus\", which he proposed to divide in his synopsis of the known macropod species.\n\nThe medium-sized, often colourful and extremely agile rock-wallabies live where rocky, rugged and steep terrain can provide daytime refuge. Males are slightly larger than females with a body length of up to 59 cm and a 70 cm long tail.\n\nRock-wallabies are nocturnal and live a fortress existence spending their days in steep, rocky, complex terrain in some kind of shelter (cave, overhang or vegetation) and ranging out into surrounding terrain at night for feed. The greatest activity occurs three hours before sunrise and after sunset.\n\nTheir reliance on refuges leads to the rock-wallabies living in small groups or colonies, with individuals having overlapping home ranges of about 15 hectares each. Within their colonies they seem to be highly territorial with a male’s territory overlapping one or a number of female territories. Even at night the wallabies do not move further than two kilometres from their home refuges.\n\nGenerally, there are three categories of habitat that the different species of rock-wallaby seem to prefer:\n\nSuitable habitat is limited and patchy and has led to varying degrees of isolation of colonies and a genetic differentiation specific to these colonies.\nThe rock wallaby height is ranges from 60 cm to 70 cm.\n\nTheir total numbers and range have been drastically reduced since European colonisation, with populations becoming extinct from the south.\n\nThe ongoing extinction of colonies in recent times is of particular concern. In 1988, at Jenolan Caves in New South Wales for example, a caged population of 80 rock-wallabies was released to boost what was thought to be an abundant local wild population. By 1992 the total population was down to about seven. The survivors were caught and enclosed in a fox and cat-proof enclosure, and the numbers in this captive population have since begun to increase.\n\nScientists consider foxes the major reason for the recent extinctions, along with competing herbivores, especially goats, sheep and rabbits, diseases such as toxoplasmosis and hydatidosis, habitat fragmentation and destruction and a lower genetic health due to the increasing isolation of colonies.\n\nHabitat conservation and pest management addressing foxes and goats appear to be the most urgent recovery actions to save the species.\n\nThe national recovery team with support from non-government organisations such as the Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife has implemented various programs ranging from land acquisition to captive breeding and awareness raising projects.\n\nMonitoring programs are implemented to register any changes in population sizes. Genetic surveys establish the genetic diversity of populations. Fox and goat eradication aid the survival of local populations, and captive breeding programs are used as an 'insurance policy' to build up wallaby numbers to boost wild populations.\n\nIn the case of the yellow-footed rock-wallaby these strategies have prevented the extinction of the species in New South Wales.\n\nThe following is a list of species, with common names, arranged by alliances of species-groups,\n", "id": "7713804", "categories": ["Marsupials of Australia", "Macropods"], "title": "Rock-wallaby"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7713809", "text": "Gas bubbler\n\nA gas bubbler is a piece of laboratory glassware which consists of a glass bulb filled with a small amount of fluid — usually mineral or silicone oil, less commonly mercury. The inlet to the bulb is connected to a ground glass joint, while the outlet is vented to the air.\n\nGas bubblers are used to exclude air from a reaction or a system. In the former case, the gas bubbler is fitted on the condenser of the reaction set-up. In the latter case, an oil bubbler is usually installed at the end of the inert gas manifold on a Schlenk line to prevent contamination by atmospheric oxygen and water.\n\nA gas bubbler acts as a one-way valve — gases (hot air, evolved gases, solvent vapors) from the inlet will bubble through the fluid before being vented to the atmosphere. \nIf there were an underpressure in the reaction vessel (such as when heat is removed, and the gases within contract), some fluid is sucked into a sump to equalize the pressure, instead of air. Wherever possible, such \"suck back\" should be avoided by filling the reaction apparatus with inert gas because an excessively low pressure will cause oil to be sucked into the reaction vessel, contaminating it.\n\nThe bubbles allow the worker to visibly confirm that the system is being flushed with inert gas; the rate at which bubbles form allow the worker to adjust the inlet pressure.\n\nOil bubblers are filled with mineral or silicone oil. These are both quite resistant to chemical attack. Oil bubblers are predominantly used; the oil is inexpensive and not toxic.\n\nA drawback is that due to oil's lower density, in event of underpressure in the reaction vessel, enough oil may be sucked through the sump into the inert gas system to contaminate it. Due to the same reason, the pressure within the inert gas system will always remain close to atmospheric. This is a disadvantage when attempting cannula transfers using inert gas pressure to force a liquid reagent into another using a cannula.\n\nMercury bubblers are largely similar in construction to oil bubblers. They usually have a longer body to prevent mercury from splashing out through the bubbler outlet, and the inlet connection usually has a sintered glass disc to prevent mercury from being sucked back into the inert gas system when refilling an evacuated vessel.\n\nThe most important advantage of mercury over oil, is that a fair amount of pressure can be maintained within the inert gas system (equivalent to the height of the mercury column). Tall columns may be used to exploit this further. By increasing the pressure within the inert gas system, boiling points are increased, allowing reactions under reflux to be carried out at a higher temperature. Also, cannula transfers are accomplished more easily due to the greater gas pressure available to push a liquid reagent from a vessel, through a cannula, into another vessel.\n\nMercury bubblers are avoided where possible, due to the difficulty and expense in dealing with mercury spills. In addition, mercury can react with various chemicals, such as ammonia and acetylenes, with potentially hazardous results. In the context of cannula transfer, mercury bubblers may be avoided by pulling (instead of pushing) liquids through the cannula by vacuum. Alternatively, the oil bubbler may be closed off from the inert gas line with a stopcock, allowing inert gas to push the reagent through the cannula. Excess pressure is bled off from a bubbler fitted directly over the receiving vessel.\n\n", "id": "7713809", "categories": [], "title": "Gas bubbler"}

Its home is the Orpheum Theater.\n\nThe Sioux City Symphony Orchestra and The Sioux City Municipal Band were each formed in the early 1930s under the guidance and direction of Leo Kucinski. Under Kucinski's leadership, the orchestra gradually developed into a highly respected, paid-professional Class B civic orchestra with a regular performing season. The orchestra originally performed in the Sioux City Municipal Auditorium, but in 2001 moved to the restored historic Orpheum Theater.\n\nThe Municipal Band, with close kinship to the orchestra, is also a paid-professional group that traces its origins to The Monahan Post 64 Band of the American Legion, in the 1920s. The Monahan Post Band became world-famous when it was selected as the \"official\" band of the American Legion in the mid-1920s. From its founding until the early 1930s, The Monahan Post Band made several tours that included concert appearances in New York City, New Orleans and Paris. The home of the Municipal Band is the city band shell in Grandview Park.\n\nSioux City's ability to produce highly gifted musicians for fine music of all styles can be attributed to its citizens' very strong and longstanding commitment to and financial investment in music education within the public and private school systems. In the 1930s, Kucinski worked closely with Superintendent of Schools M.G. Clark to create the foundation for its public school music program. Additionally, Morningside College has long been home to a vital and energetic music department, which has served to contribute to the pool of fine musicians and music educators in Sioux City. Sioux City has an All-City Orchestra whose members are elementary grade students who participate by audition, and the Siouxland Youth Symphony, whose players are selected by competitive auditions from the junior schools and high schools in the area.\n\nAfter Kucinski, other music directors of the orchestra have included Thomas Lewis, Stephen Rogers Radcliffe and Xian Zhang. Xian Zhang had originally been contracted to the orchestra for 3 years, but resigned after 2 years because of her schedule demands. In March 2009, the orchestra announced the appointment of Ryan Haskins as its next music director, as of 1 July 2009.\n\n\n", "id": "7713811", "categories": ["Articles needing audio and or video", "Musical groups from Iowa", "American orchestras", "Performing arts in Iowa", "Symphony orchestra articles needing audio and or video", "Musical groups established in 1925"], "title": "Sioux City Symphony Orchestra"}

Described in the show's introduction as \"The general knowledge music quiz\", the questions are about music, from classical, jazz, pop, musicals, and all other forms of music. It was originally hosted by Ned Sherrin (1986–2006). In the chair for the 2007 series was Edward Seckerson with Paul Gambaccini taking over in 2008, following the death of Ned Sherrin in 2007. Russell Davies took over temporarily in 2013 following allegations made against Gambaccini, who returned to the show in November 2014 after being cleared of the allegations.\n\nThe quiz is played by three contestants over three rounds, or \"movements\" as they are known in the show.\n\nIn the first round, each contestant is asked four (or occasionally three if there is a shortage of time) questions, two of which are illustrated by short musical pieces. Two points are awarded for a correct answer, or one point for a partially correct response. If the given answer is incorrect, or partially incorrect, the other two contestants may buzz in for one point. If there is a tie at the end of the first round, a further buzzer question is asked to determine the contestants' order for the next round.\n\nThe middle round is a solo round, similar to the 'specialist subject' format of \"Mastermind\", with the difference that the contestants have neither chosen nor been given warning of the subject. Five categories of questions are offered, some of which are very specific e.g. \"Beethoven's Piano Sonatas\", while others are more general, for instance \"sunshine and rain\". The contestant with the most points after round one chooses from the five categories, the runner-up chooses from the four remaining, and the contestant in last place chooses from the three that are left. Each round consists of seven (occasionally six) questions, including three musical cues. Again two points are given for a correct answer, but, in this round, questions answered incorrectly are not offered to the other contestants.\n\nThe final round consists of a variable number of questions, usually no more than twenty. Any contestant can answer these questions, provided they buzz in first. A correct answer will add one point to a contestant's score. If an incorrect answer is given, a contestant is deducted one point.\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of each regular show wins the right to appear again, later in the series, to compete against other winners from the current series. The series is completed in 13 weeks, the last show being the final, at the end of which the series' winner is decided.\n\nThe show has been broadcast in BBC Radio 4's Monday afternoon quiz slot since 1998 with a repeat on the following Saturday evening. Three main question-setters have been used by the programme: Ian Gillies, often referred to as Mycroft by Robert Robinson in \"Brain of Britain\" (1986–2000); David Kenrick, the 1993 champion (1993 – )referred to as ' Clever Mr Kochel ' by Ned Sherrin ; and Stephen Follows a semi-finalist 1996 ( 2002 - ). 'Counterpoint' has been produced since 2001 by Paul Bajoria. In November 2014, Paul Gambaccini returned to present the programme after being cleared of allegations against him. In his absence the programme had been hosted by Russell Davies.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of \"Counterpoint\" champions since 1988.\n\nThe current \"Counterpoint\" theme is Bach's \"Partita in E major\", arranged and performed by Jacques Loussier. The original theme tune for the programme, when it began in 1986, was the Arrival of the Queen of Sheba by Georg Friedrich Handel. In the late 1990s it was opened by a specially commissioned piece entitled \"Counterpoint\", by musician Ray Davies.\n", "id": "7713835", "categories": ["British classical music radio programmes", "British radio game shows", "1990s British game shows", "1980s British game shows", "2000s British game shows", "BBC Radio 4 programmes"], "title": "Counterpoint (radio programme)"}

Since 1997, the company has been a wholly owned subsidiary of shoe industry giant Wolverine World Wide. The company recorded total sales of footwear and clothing of nearly $500 million in 2010.\n\nMerrell was established in 1981 when two executives for the Rossignol ski company, Clark Matis and John Schweizer, decided to launch a new maker of hiking boots, The pair decided to join forces with Randal Ivan Merrell (R.I. Merrell), a maker of highly-praised custom boots which retailed for $500 a pair. Matis set to work designing a more affordable high-performance boot, which was developed in 1982. Plans were made for production of the new line in factories located in Italy, a leading exporter of footwear to the world market at the time.\n\nIn 1983, the new Merrell company delivered its first product to the market, making shipments to a pair of east coast retailers specializing in hiking gear.\n\nIn 1986, Randy Merrell sought to return to his previous life as a maker of custom boots and sold his share of the company bearing his name. That same year the company sold its 25,000th pair of boots.\n\nIn 1987, Merrell was purchased by Karhu. The new owners moved production of Merrell products to Asia, reducing retail prices and expanding sales. In 1988, sales of Merrell products topped the $4 million mark.\n\nA period of rapid growth for Merrell followed with 1989 sales increasing by 50%, to the $6 million mark. By 1990, some 300,000 pairs of shoes and boots were being sold annually, with sales for the year topping the $10 million mark for the first time. The company became a global enterprise, with divisions established in Canada, the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and the United States.\n\nThe year 1992 saw another doubling of the company's sales volume, topping the $20 million mark. By the middle of the decade, Merrell products were being sold in 22 countries.\n\nIn 1997, Karhu sold Merrell to Wolverine World Wide, a large footwear corporation which manufactured Hush Puppies shoes and Wolverine brand boots. In the year of the Wolverine acquisition, Merrell sales volume totaled $23 million.\n\nWolverine introduced a new lighter-weight sensibility to the line, beginning with a trail running shoe called the \"Jungle Runner.\" This initial foray into lightweight footwear was not a commercial success, but a team led by Clark Matis came up with the idea of using a very aggressive trail running outsole with a casual slip-on upper made of pigskin suede, a material previously perfected and used extensively in the Hush Puppies line.\n\nThe work of Matis' design group culminated with the introduction of what would become the brand's signature shoe, the \"Jungle Moc.\" The new product was a smash success, with total shipments of Jungle Mocs hitting 3.5 million pairs by 2002. The 10 millionth pair of Jungle Mocs was shipped in 2009, with the style continuing in production to the present date.\n\nIn 2007, the Merrell line was expanded yet again to include apparel and accessories.\n\nBy 2010, Merrell products were being sold in 151 countries. Annual sales for the brand totaled nearly $500 million in 2010.\n\nThe company operates 116 of its own concept stores around the world, with another 20 to 25 new stores planned to open in 2011.

The first of these units was raised in Eritrea in 1882, drawing from existing companies of \"basci bazuks\" (irregular troops).\n\nIn Tripolitania and Cyrenaica the Italian officered zaptié were generally used for patrolling rural areas in coastal regions, while mounted police or spahis operated in the southern desert regions, together with camel mounted meharists. In the city of Tripoli civilian police were employed. The original Libyan zaptié were recruited from indigenous gendarmerie of the same name, who had served under the Turkish government prior to 1910. \n\nIn Italian Somaliland, the zaptié provided a ceremonial escort for the Italian Viceroy (Governor) as well as the territorial police. There were nearly one thousand such para-military police in 1922, when Benito Mussolini took control of the Italian government and started a policy of \"pacification\" and assimilation of the Italian colonies. \n\nZaptié troopers were armed with 1874 model revolvers, cavalry carbines, and 1871 model sabres. Officers and some non-commissioned officers were Italian, but the rank and file were recruited from the colony in question.

Uniforms varied from colony to colony, but usually comprised fezes, red sashes and khaki or white clothing. A common feature was the white and red collar insignia of the carabinieri.\n\nThree hundred zaptié took part in the Italian conquest of northern Somalia in 1925. As part of the \"colonna Musso\", they assisted in the occupation of the Sultanate of Hobyo (Hafun and Ordio). Other zaptìé units served with the \"colonna Bergesio\" in the Elemari region (Gallacaio, Garad and Sinedogò).

Opera seasons start in October and end in the early summer of the following year.\n\nHOT performs most of its mainstage productions at the Blaisdell Concert Hall and has also staged works at the historic Hawaii Theatre, warehouses, the Chinatown Artist Lofts, and other funky venues. Since 2004 HOT has added a summer production of a comic opera by Gilbert and Sullivan or a musical, and in 2016 will stage a concert production of Verdi's \"Rigoletto\" starring Hawaii's own baritone, Quinn Kelsey. Kelsey began his career as a chorus member in HOT's acclaimed volunteer chorus, and has gone on to shine on stages across the world.\n\nThe first opera ever presented by the organization was Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\", which was performed in McKinley High School auditorium in Honolulu in 1961. For the next two decades the company was part of the Honolulu Symphony. In 1980 it became an independent tax-exempt corporation. The first independent season was in 1981 and consisted of three productions: \"La Bohème\", \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", and \"Carmen\". Supertitles were introduced in 1987 and 1989 was the first year in which all available seats were sold before opening night. By 1993 HOT membership had exceeded 2,000 individuals. The company is currently led by Interim General Director Karen Tiller.\n\nThe year 2002 saw HOT's \"Bad Girl Season\" with productions of \"La traviata\", \"Salome\", and \"Carmen\". Sets and costumes for \"Salome\" were designed by artist Thomas Woodruff. The 2007 production of \"Madama Butterfly\", a co-production with Opera Omaha, featured set and costume designs by the visual artist Jun Kaneko.\n\nThe Summer Season was launched in 2004 with Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Mikado\", followed by \"The Pirates of Penzance\" (2005), \"The King and I\" with Richard Chamberlain (2006), \"South Pacific\" (2007), and \"A Little Night Music\" (2008). The summer production for 2009 was cancelled for budgetary reasons. Charity Navigator has awarded the company its top \"4-star\" rating for responsible fiscal management since 2007.\n\nIn 2014, HOT staged a modern production of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Mikado\" in Honolulu and on Maui. Akina led his artistic team in creating a presentation that included anime, harajuku girls, and yakuza-inspired characters.\n\nIn 2015, HOT launched its Opera in a Warehouse initiative. A part of its #ImHOT campaign to take opera into the community and develop a new generation of opera goers, the company staged Jonathan Dove's chamber opera, \"Siren Song\", a story of a young sailor involved in a catfish scandal. The company took over an empty warehouse in the arts district of Kaka'ako and turned it into a production venue. \"Siren Song\", directed by Akina, received rave reviews and combined a modern, relevant story with the designs by video designer Adam Turner dancing on the white warehouse walls to create a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nIn 2016, HOT added two special one-night only concerts to its calendar including \"Rigoletto in Concert\" starring Hawaii's Quinn Kelsey and the Hawaii debut of the internationally acclaimed trio Sol3 Mio. A family of classically trained singers from New Zealand, Sol3 Mio presents a blend of opera and pop that have thrilled audiences around the world.\n\nA classroom-based education program was begun in 1981 and was expanded to more elementary and high school grade levels in 1984. A program called \"Opera Highlights\" became part of the curriculum of the University of Hawaii's College of Continuing Education in 1983. HOT now has several educational programs, most notably its \"Opera For Everyone\" (OFE) program. OFE allows students to participate in all aspects of an opera production from technical crew to performing to simply watching an opera. The final dress rehearsal is opened up to students for a reduced price, usually on a Wednesday night. Other aspects of the show are assisted by OFE participants who can help in such aspects as set building, costuming and makeup, or performance. This is a rare opportunity offered to students who may pursue careers in opera in the future, and is one of the programs that makes HOT unique.\n\nHOT's Education Team serves over 25,000 keiki and adult learners each year through its innovative programming. The OFE program stages over 75 performances at schools on multiple islands throughout the State of Hawaii.\n\n\n", "id": "7713942", "categories": ["Tourist attractions in Honolulu", "1961 establishments in Hawaii", "Musical groups established in 1961", "American opera companies", "Culture of Honolulu"], "title": "Hawaii Opera Theatre"}

When a search for weapons is also authorized, the procedure is known as a stop and frisk. To justify the stop, a law enforcement officer must be able to point to \"specific and articulable facts\"\nthat would indicate to a reasonable person that a crime has been, is being, or is about to be committed. \n\nIf the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect is in possession of a weapon that is of danger to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a frisking of the suspect's outer garments to search for weapons.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7714036", "text": "Corydon Historic District\n\nThe Corydon Historic District is a national historic district located in Corydon, Indiana, United States. The town of Corydon is also known as Indiana's First State Capital and as Historic Corydon. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, but the listing was amended in 1988 to expand the district's geographical boundaries and include additional sites. The district includes numerous historical structures, most notably the Old Capitol (Indiana's first state capitol building), the Old Treasury Building (Indiana's first state office building), Governor Hendricks' Headquarters, the Constitution Elm Memorial, the Posey House, the Kintner-McGrain House (Cedar Glade), and The Kintner House Inn, as well as other residential and commercial sites.\n\nCorydon, Indiana, which was platted in 1808, continues to serve as the county seat of government for Harrison County, Indiana. The town served as the second capital of the Indiana Territory from 1813 to 1816, but it is best known for its service as the first capital of Indiana from 1816 to 1825. Some of the most significant structures within the historic district date from this early period of the town's history, including the Old Capitol, the centerpiece of the district.\n\nCorydon became the seat of government for the Indiana Territory when the territorial capital was moved from Vincennes, in Knox County, shortly after the outbreak of the War of 1812. Dennis Pennington, a Harrison County representative and the speaker of the territorial legislature's lower house, helped secure Corydon's selection as the capital by pointing out that the Harrison County Courthouse, which the county government planned to build on Corydon's public square, could be used as an assembly building for the territorial legislature. Pennington was awarded the contract to supervise construction of the courthouse, which became known as the Old Capitol.\n\nIn addition to its role as the capitol of the Indiana Territory, Corydon served as the site of a constitutional convention to consider statehood for Indiana in 1816. Forty-three delegates convened from June 10 to June 29, 1816, to draft Indiana's first state constitution. Sources disagree on the exact location of the gathering. Because the courthouse was not completed at that time, the delegates met at \"the courthouse on the hill,\" which may have referred to a nearby log home that the territorial government had rented. Cramped conditions and the summer heat caused the men to gather under a giant elm tree, which was later named the Constitution Elm. The town's historic district includes a portion of the tree's preserved trunk, surrounded by a sandstone memorial.\n\nThe Indiana General Assembly met for the first time at Corydon under the new constitution and state government on November 4, 1816, and Indiana was admitted as the nineteenth state in the Union on December 11, 1816. Corydon served as the first state capital of Indiana from 1816 to 1825, when the seat of state government was moved to Indianapolis.\nWhen the historic district was first added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, the area encompassed eight sites that existed when Corydon became the capital of Indiana in 1816. These include the Old Capitol building (Harrison County Courthouse), along with the public square surrounding it, Indiana's first state office building (also known as the Old Treasury Building), Governor William Hendricks' Headquarters, the Constitution Elm, the Posey House, the Westfall House, the Branham home/tavern, and the Kintner-McGrain House (named Cedar Glade).\n\nIn 1989 the district was extended to Indian Creek in the north and west, east to College Avenue, and south to Little Indian Creek to include additional historic structures. The district's period of significance spans from 1808 to 1929. The district's boundary increase encompassed the eight structures from its early era as a territorial and state capital, as well as commercial and residential buildings constructed after 1825, including a new, three-story county Harrison County Courthouse that was completed in 1929.\n\nA historical marker erected on the Harrison County Courthouse lawn denotes the town's surrender to Confederate Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan's raiders following the Battle of Corydon on July 9, 1863. The battle site, which is located outside of town, is listed separately on the National Register. The district's courthouse square also includes a memorial to the late Indiana governor Frank O'Bannon; his father, Robert P. O'cannon; and grandfather, Lew O'cannon, all of whom were prominent in Corydon. Plans for the O'Bannon memorial on the southwest corner of the courthouse square were announced on May 22, 2007. It includes a lifesize bronze statue of Frank O'Bannon sitting on a limestone bench and three pillars honoring the O'Bannons. The memorial, which cost $200,000, was dedicated in June 2008. Because of its history as a territorial and state capital, Corydon sees an estimated 30,000 visitors each year.\n\nThe Old Capitol building, a part of the Corydon Capital State Historic Site, is administered by the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites. The two-story, Federal-style, limestone building served as Indiana's first state capitol from 1816 until 1825. The building was originally intended to serve as the Harrison County Courthouse. Construction began in 1814, when Corydon was the capital of the Indiana Territory. The building was nearly completed in 1816, the year that Indiana was granted statehood and its first state legislature convened at Corydon. The building was primarily used as an assembly building for the territorial and state legislatures, but the county government and district courts occasionally used it when the Indiana General Assembly was not in session. Dennis Pennington, who became the state's first speaker of the Indiana Senate after statehood in 1816, supervised its construction.\n\nThe two-story building is forty feet square with walls thick. The exposed exterior of the building is not dressed, using only stones that were cut roughly square. The foundation, dug into the ground, is also thick. The lower level has ceilings, flagstone floors, and a barn rail made from hewn timber. The upper floor's ceiling is tall. The original building had a scale and balance on the roof as the symbol of justice, but they were removed in 1833 and replaced with a large bell. The construction cost of original building was approximately $3,000. Two large chimneys that accommodated the four fireplaces installed in both the upper and lower levels were closed up during later renovations. A wood floor covered the original flagstone floor.\n\nWhen Corydon became the state capital of Indiana in 1816, the Old Capitol building served as the seat of state government. The Indiana Supreme Court and the Indiana Senate were located on the upper level; the Indiana House of Representatives met on the first floor. After 1825, when the state capital was moved to Indianapolis, the Old Captol building continued to be used as the Harrison County Courthouse and county government office building until 1929, when a new county courthouse was completed.\n\nIn 1917 the State of Indiana purchased the Old Capitol building with the intention of preserving it. The restored building opened in 1929 and has since been preserved and protected as a memorial. The Old Capitol, sometimes referred to as the Corydon Capitol, was included within the original boundaries of the Corydon Historic District when it was listed on the National Register in 1973. The building has been restored as closely as possible to its original appearance, including furniture and paint colors. In 2015 a major restoration project was completed on the town square to protect the Old Capitol building from water damage, update the electrical system and landscaping, and to install new walkways.\n\nThe first state office building, which dates from 1817, is also known as the Old Treasury Building. It housed state government offices, including the first state auditor's and treasurer's offices. The building was included in the initial historic district designation. It is located on Walnut Street, east of the Governor's Hendricks' Headquarters. The Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites Corporation began a major rehabilitation of this building in 2008.\n\nGovernor Hendricks's Headquarters is also part of the Corydon Capitol State Historic Site. Davis Floyd, a former treasurer and auditor of the Indiana Territory and a delegate to the constitutional convention in 1816, built the residence in 1817, when he was an Indiana state legislator. After Floyd lost the home during the financial Panic of 1819, the state government purchased it to house the Indiana's governor. It opened as a state historic site in 1979.\n\nWilliam Hendricks occupied the building from 1822 to 1825, when he was governor of InIndiana. Hendricks was Indiana's first state representative to U.S. House of Representatives in 1816 and later served in the U.S. Senate. William A. Porter, a lawyer, judge, and politician, purchased the building in 1841. Judge Porter served in the Indiana legislature was speaker of Indiana House in 1847–48.\n\nThe Constitution Elm commemorates the first state constitutional convention that was held from June 10 to June 29, 1816, when forty-three delegates convened at Corydon to discuss statehood for the territory and draft a state constitution for Indiana. The cramped conditions of the log cabin where the constitution convention was held, along with the summer heat, caused the delegates to gather outdoors under the branches of a nearby elm tree, which was later memorialized as the Constitution Elm. It has been estimated that the giant elm was tall with a trunk that measured across and branches that spread more than . Dutch elm disease destroyed the tree in 1925; however, the trunk has been preserved. It is protected by a sandstone memorial.\n\nThe Posey home was included in the district's original National Register designation in 1973. Allan D. Thom and Thomas Lloyd Posey were the original owners of the home when its construction began in 1817. Colonel Posey was the son of Thomas Posey, governor of the Indiana Territory from 1813 to 1816. Colonel Posey, who was active in Harrison County's civic affairs, served as the county treasurer (1818–24) and was appointed adjutant general of Indiana in 1823. He used one room as his office and operated a dry-goods and cabinet shop in another portion of the house. Colonel Posey never married, but he raised fourteen orphans in the home.\n\nThe majority of the two-story brick home was built between 1817 and 1818. It was constructed in three stages: the main house; a wing used as offices, a store, and a cabinet shop; and a two-story ell at the rear of the home that housed a dining room, kitchen, pantry, smokehouse, and woodshed. Servant quarters were located on the ell's second floor. The rear of the property included woods and a spring, as well as several outbuildings. A portion of the home was later demolished.\n\nThe property passed through several owners until the Daughters of the American Revolution acquired it in 1925 \nand operated it as a local history museum through 1999. The Posey home was acquired by the State of Indiana in 2000, but it remained vacant until it was donated to the Historical Society of Harrison County in 2012.\n\nThe Westfall House, a log cabin located near the Constitution Elm, is the oldest extant building in Corydon. The home is privately owned and not open to the public.\n\nWilliam Branham began operating a tavern on the site in 1809 in a structure originally built in 1800.\n\nOriginally known as Cedar Glade, the Kintner-McGrain House was the home of Jacob Kintner, who built the Greek Revival-style residence in 1808 near Indian Creek. Kintner's heirs sold the property in 1849 to Thomas McGrain Sr.\n\nThe Kintner House Hotel, completed in 1873, originally had twenty-six rooms for guests on its upper floor. It was converted to apartments in the early twentieth century and was used for other commercial purposes until it was renovated into a bed and breakfast inn in 1986–87. The property, which is located within the district, was listed separately on the National Register in 1987.\n\nThe three-story county Harrison County Courthouse, which is located next to the Old Capitol, was completed in 1929.\n\nThe Grand Masonic Lodge first organized in 1817 under the Grand Lodge of Kentucky; the Grand Lodge of Indiana organized in Madison in 1818. It is the oldest Masonic Lodge building in Indiana. Its founding members included State Senator Dennis Pennington; Indiana first governor Jonathan Jennings; State Representative Davis Floyd, and U.S. Congressman William Hendricks, among others. The present-day lodge building on Elm Street was erected in 1926. \nIt is still used by Masons and the Order of the Eastern Star.\n\nConstruction on the school, which was originally known as the Corydon Colored School, began in 1891. It served as a primary and secondary school for the community's black students. The first graduation of high school students from the school occurred on May 14, 1897. In 1949 the Indiana General Assembly passed an act to desegregate Indiana's public schools by 1954. The Corydon Colored School closed in 1950, when the Corydon public schools were racially integrated, beginning in the 1950–51 school year. In 1987 the school was renamed for Leora Brown Farrow, the school's longest serving-teacher, who taught at school from 1924 until 1950.\n\nThe school is located at the corner of Summit and Hill Streets, a block east of the district's amended boundary line that was established as part of the National Register listing in 1989. Although the school was added to Indiana's Register of Historic Places in 1992 and is recognized with a state historical marker, it is not listed as a separate property in the National Register as of 2016. The building was converted to a cultural center in 1993.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7714036", "categories": ["Historic American Buildings Survey in Indiana", "Museums in Harrison County, Indiana", "Tourist attractions in Harrison County, Indiana", "National Register of Historic Places in Harrison County, Indiana", "Corydon, Indiana", "Buildings and structures in Harrison County, Indiana", "Federal architecture in Indiana", "Historic house museums in Indiana", "Open-air museums in Indiana", "Indiana State Historic Sites"], "title": "Corydon Historic District"}

The station is owned by Monte Spearman and Gentry Todd Spearman, through licensee High Plains Radio Network, LLC.\n\nIn November 1941, Helena's first radio station KFFA went on the air. Station Manager and part owner Sam Anderson offered to sell a block of time to a group of blues musicians on the condition that they obtain a sponsor. Max Moore, owner of Interstate Grocer Company, which distributed King Biscuit Flour, agreed to sponsor the show — thus was born King Biscuit Entertainers and the beginning of King Biscuit Time.\n\nThe program was first broadcast on November 21, 1941, and featured blues artists Sonny Boy Williamson and Robert Lockwood, Jr. playing live in the studio. Other musicians who played on the show included pianist Pinetop Perkins and guitarist Robert Nighthawk. Musicians such as guitarist Hound Dog Taylor would stop by for occasional appearances.\n\nThese KFFA broadcasts, heard in the hometowns of Nighthawk, Lockwood, and Sonny Boy, were a draw to young southern blues artists who came to Helena to hang around and learn. Jimmy Rogers and Little Walter, later central to the sound of the Muddy Waters band, were among them.

His mother was Polish, née Gruszecka. Having graduated from Moscow University in 1904, he began his political and scholarly career in Imperial Russia. He became a member of the Russian Constitutional Democratic party (“Cadets”) in 1906 and joined the People’s Socialist Party in 1907. In 1911, Melgunov established a publishing house \"Zadruga\" (\"Задруга\") where he published over 500 books and a journal \"Golos minuvshego\" (\"The Voice of the Past\"). After the 1917 Bolshevik October Revolution, he became an active opponent of Lenin’s government and joined the anti-Soviet Union of Revival of Russia, which advocated an armed overthrow of the Bolshevik regime.\n\nHe was arrested and sentenced to death in 1919, then reprieved, with the sentence commuted to imprisonment. He was released in 1921 and forced into exile in 1922. Melgunov finally settled in Paris, where he continued his historical research and edited several émigré journals. His most famous book is \"Red Terror in Russia\" () published in 1924. Historian Robert Gellately describes Melgunov's pioneering study of the Red Terror as \"a detailed and shocking account\" which \"has been confirmed by recent revelations from the Russian archives and by historians.\". Conversely, French historian , Russophone and veteran specialist in the history of the Soviet Union, has more recently credited Melgonov with the wholesale invention of at least one \"legend\" about the Red Army: \"The Crimea is the location of the last military confrontation between Red and White forces. The battle there fought bred contradictory narratives and legends, like the many-times repeated one (since its invention in 1923 by a certain Melgunov) according to which, after Wrangel's defeat, Trotsky executed, not only 500 dockers (!), but also 50,000 soldiers and officers of this army ; yet the vast majority of this army had succeeded in leaving by boat!\". Indeed, according to Wrangel's officers' own published accounts, \"Wrangel's general staff succeeded in evacuating about 145,000 men out of an army of a little more than 150,000. The 50,000 officers of Wrangel's army that several \"historians\" have Trotsky and Bela Kun execute issue thus from an imagination that, while fertile, proves incompatible with arithmatics\".\n\nSerge Petrovich Melgunov, \"Red Terror in Russia\", Hyperion Pr (1975), \n\n", "id": "7714055", "categories": ["1879 births", "1956 deaths", "Moscow State University alumni", "Writers from Moscow", "Russian historians", "Russian anti-communists", "People from Moscow Governorate", "Russian Constitutional Democratic Party members", "Popular Socialists (Russia)"], "title": "Sergei Melgunov"}
