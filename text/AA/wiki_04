A high-impedance part of the instrument, such as a string, transmits vibrations through a bridge (intermediate impedance) to a sound board (lower impedance). The soundboard then moves the still lower-impedance air. Without bridge and soundboard, the instrument does not transmit enough sound to the air, and is too quiet to be performed with. An electric guitar has no soundboard; it uses a microphone pick-up and artificial amplification. Without amplification, electric guitars are very quiet.\n\nStethoscopes roughly match the acoustical impedance of the human body, so they transmit sounds from a patient's chest to the doctor's ear much more effectively than the air does. Putting an ear to someone's chest would have a similar effect.\n\nIn building\nAcoustic transmission in building design refers to a number of processes by which sound can be transferred from one part of a building to another.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7714083", "text": "China–South Korea relations\n\nDiplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and South Korea were formally established on August 24, 1992. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s the PRC recognized only North Korea while South Korea in turn recognized only the Republic of China in Taiwan. South Korea was the last Asian country to establish relations with the People's Republic of China. In recent years, China and South Korea have endeavored to boost their strategic and cooperative partnership in numerous sectors, as well as promoting high level relationship. Trade, tourism and multiculturalism, in specific, have been the most important factors of strengthening two neighbouring countries cooperative partnership.\n\nWhile the dispute of THAAD had initiated conflicts between the two countries in various sectors, at the end of October 2017, the two countries ended the 1-year-long diplomatic dispute and have been working swiftly to get their relationship back on track since, strengthening exchanges and cooperation between each other, creating harmony of interests, and agreed to resume exchanges and cooperation in all areas. All economic and cultural bans from China towards South Korea were also lifted as a result, with political and security cooperation, businesses and cultural exchanges between the two countries getting back to healthy state.\n\nUpon resumption of relationship, China and South Korea have been organizing presidential and governmental visits, working together on the Korean Peninsula, assisting with the development of other countries, and cooperating in numerous areas.\n\nFor much of the past few millennia, Korea (parts or the whole) was a vassal state to various Chinese dynasties.\n\nJapanese colonization of Korea was to last until Japan's defeat in World War 2.\n\nThe newly established People's Republic of China participated in the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, sending the People's Volunteer Army to fight alongside Soviet Union and against United States and United Nations troops in October 1950. It successfully drove the UN forces out of North Korea, but its own offensive into the South itself was repelled. The participation of the PVA strained relations between South Korea and China. The Korean War concluded in July 1953, resulting in the establishment of the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and the eventual withdrawal of Chinese forces from the Korean Peninsula. US troops though have remained in South Korea to this day.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, there were no official relations between the PRC and ROK. The PRC maintained close relations with North Korea, and South Korea maintained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China in Taiwan. This hindered trade between Seoul and Beijing, because South Korea was unable to protect its citizens and business interests in China without some form of international agreements. Beijing's economic needs involving South Korea were initially eclipsed by those of Moscow.\n\nPresident Park Chung-hee initiated and President Chun Doo-hwan advanced a policy of establishing relations with China and the Soviet Union, and attempting to improve those with North Korea. China and the USSR had significant sway in determining the future of the Korean Peninsula. Good relations with old allies of North Korea were therefore integral to the Nordpolitik policy.\n\nSeoul's official contact with Beijing started by the landing of a hijacked Chinese civilian airliner in May 1983. China sent a delegation of thirty-three officials to Seoul to negotiate its return. This marked the beginning of a series of casual exchanges of citizens. For example, in March 1984, a South Korean tennis team visited Kunming for a Davis Cup match with a Chinese team. In April 1984, a thirty-four-member Chinese basketball team arrived in Seoul to participate in the Eighth Asian Junior Basketball Championships. Some Chinese officials reportedly paid quiet visits to South Korea to inspect its industries, while South Korean officials visited China to attend a range of international conferences.\n\nActive South Korean-Chinese individual contacts have been encouraged. Academics, journalists, and particularly families divided between South Korea and China were able to exchange visits freely in the late 1980s. Significant numbers of citizens of each country reside in the other. , more than 600,000 PRC citizens reside in South Korea, of whom 70% are ethnic Koreans from the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China's Jilin Province and other parts of China, while roughly 560,000 South Korean citizens lived in China.\n\nHowever, during this period significant barriers to strong trade and relations persisted. The absence of any protections granted by official relations had still remained. Beijing has been politically closer to Pyongyang, and relations with North Korea remained tense and distrustful.\n\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests Pyongyang publicly supported of Beijing's actions. Seoul, on the other hand, did not condone or condemn the actions in Tiananmen Square.\n\nTrade between the two countries continued to increase nonetheless, especially after the PRC's reform and opening up. Furthermore, China has attempted to mediate between North Korea and the US; between North Korea and Japan; and also initiated and promoted tripartite talks—between Pyongyang, Seoul, and Washington.\n\nSouth Korea had been an ally of the Republic of China. But in 1992 diplomatic ties between Seoul and Taipei were nevertheless severed. On August 24, 1992 formal diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Beijing. By 2004 China had become South Korea's leading trading partner.\n\nAfter the KORUS FTA (United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement) was finalized on 30 June 2007, the Chinese government immediately began seeking an FTA agreement with South Korea. The China-Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement was finalized on December 20, 2015. Tariffs on 958 products including medical equipment, transformers, etc. were eliminated. On 1 January 2016, tariffs were eliminated on 5,779 products for 2 years. Also, in 10 years it is estimated that the Chinese tariffs will gradually go down and be eliminated on 5,846 products. South Korea has been running a trade surplus with China, which hit a record US$32.5 billion in 2009 and total trade between the two nations surpassed US$300 billion in 2014.\n\nOn 29 November 2010, a United States diplomatic cables leak mentioned two unknown Chinese officials telling then Vice-Foreign Minister Chun Yung-woo that the PRC would favor a Korea reunified under the South's government, as long as it was not hostile to China.\n\nIt was announced on 10 January 2011 that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT) established two teams of China experts and language specialists under its department handling Chinese affairs in an effort to strengthen diplomacy. An analytical team will report on political, economic and foreign affairs developments in China, and a monitoring team consisting of seven language specialists will report on public sentiment in China. The Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security (IFANS), a think-tank affiliated to MOFAT, also launched a centre dedicated to China affairs, which will act as a hub to collate research on China undertaken in Korea.\n\nThe Park-Xi summit in 2013 showed promise of warming relations, but this quickly chilled after China extended their Air Defense Identification Zone (East China Sea) over South Korean territory. Despite this, in July 2014, Xi visited South Korea before its traditional ally North Korea, and in their talks, both leaders affirmed their support for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and the ongoing free trade agreement negotiations. Both leaders also expressed their concerns over Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution.\n\nIn October 2016, South Korea lodged a formal complaint with Beijing accusing Chinese fishing boats of ramming and sinking a South Korean coast guard vessel. The incident occurred on 7 October when South Korean coast guard officers were trying to stop about 40 Chinese fishing boats from suspected illegal fishing off South Korea’s west coast. The incidents of illegal Chinese entry continued and in 1 November 2016, South Korea ships opened fire on illegal Chinese boats. No casualties were reported.\n\nIn late 2016, the United States and South Korea jointly announced the deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), allegedly in response to nuclear and missile threats by North Korea. The U.S. states that the deployment of the THAAD is “purely a defensive measure… only aimed at North Korea” and has no intention to threaten China’s security interests. But China has continuously expressed its opposition over South Korea and U.S.’s decision because of its concern that the deployment of THAAD might be a measure by the U.S. to contain China.\n\nAccording to Reuters:“It was China, not North Korea, that was the most uncomfortable with the idea of deploying THAAD in South Korea,” said Yang Uk, a military expert at the Korea Defense and Security Forum. Beijing opposed THAAD and its powerful radar that can see deeply into Chinese territory, saying it upsets the regional security balance.\n\nStating that the THAAD will undermine China's own nuclear deterrent capability, China’s Ambassador Qiu Guohong warned that the deployment of THAAD could “destroy” the China-South Korea ties in an instant, whereas the spokesperson of the president of South Korea warned China that deploying the THAAD is a “matter we will decide upon according to our own security and national interests.\" \n\nFor aims of a détente, China and South Korea held a summit in Hangzhou, eastern China, on Sept. 5, 2016 with each party’s leaders Xi Jinping and Park Geun-Hye to discuss the issue of THAAD. During the summit, Park reemphasized that the THAAD deployment is only to be aimed against North Korea and that there should be no reason for China’s security interest to be concerned. However, Xi reiterated China’s firm stance against the deployment of THAAD stating that it could “intensify disputes\". Yet, the two countries still emphasized the long history of their relationship and agreed that a stable and healthy bilateral relationship will benefit both countries.\n\nWith South Korea's decision in 2017 to accept the deployment of THAAD in the country, although China's government shied away from formal sanctions and measures it has urged its citizens through official media to express their displeasure and ill will at South Korea over the move. Chinese citizens were allowed to gather to protest. The news media has reported of citizen boycotts of South Korean products like Hyundai cars, of South Korean goods being removed from supermarket shelves, and tourists and travel companies canceling trips to South Korea.\n\nSouth Korean conglomerate Lotte Group became a particular focus. Lotte had agreed to an exchange of land, a golf course in Seongju, with the South Korean government that will be used for the THAAD deployment. In addition to a consumer boycott of Lotte stores in China, municipal authorities suddenly discovered that Lotte stores and factories to be in contravention of fire safety regulations and other local ordinances which has resulted in the closure of 75 out of 99 Lotte supermarkets. \n\nMarch sales of Hyundai and its sister brand Kia Motors in China plunged 52 per cent from a year earlier to 72,000 vehicles, the lowest level since 2014. Chinese tourism also plummeted 39.4% (compared to March 2016) in March. As a result, China has become a more hated country in South Korea than even Japan, according to an opinion poll conducted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in March 2017.\n\nAs a result South Korea's distribution industry suffered. Chinese consumers were no longer attracted to Korean products and Chinese retailers boycotted Korean products. As a result of decreased Chinese consumption, South Korean department stores, duty free, restaurants, and the automobile industry were severely affected. However, Korean conglomerates had to survive since China is the largest market in the world.\n\nHyundai had to stop the operation of Chinese factories and the economic losses were significant. The vicious cycle has been repeated as the decline of sales volume caused production suspension. Chinese automobile component manufacturing companies suspended distribution to Hyundai automobile factories that are located in China and it negatively affected the management of Hyundai automobile. THAAD had a tremendous impact on Korean economy in various business sectors and tarnished the brand value of Korean companies because of political reasons.\n\nKorean culture, singers, actors and dancers are popular with Chinese youth because of the development of the internet and export of Korean cultural content. After the THAAD dispute took place, a \"limit Korea order\" () was placed upon Hallyu. In China, Hallyu cultural events were canceled, Korean actors had to quit from their works and limited Korean media could be exported to China. The ban was lifted soon after, and relations cooled.\n\nThe Chinese historical claims surrounding Goguryeo and its related kingdoms created some tension between Korea and the PRC. The PRC government has recently begun the Northeast Project, a controversial Chinese government research project claiming Goguryeo and other various Korean kingdoms, including Gojoseon, Buyeo and Balhae, to be Chinese tributary states. This sparked a massive uproar in South Korea when the project was widely publicized in 2004.\n\nDue to the Empire of Japan and atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army on both Koreans and Chinese, from comfort women and the Japanese colonization of Korea to the Nanjing Massacre and Unit 731, South Korea and China are unified in their stance against Japan and insistence on greater reparations for Japan wartime atrocities.\n\nWhen the Korean peninsula was colonized by Imperial Japan, the provisional government of the ROK in exile in Shanghai received the support of China.\n\nBoth the governments of China and South Korea take a firm stand on issues in relation to Japanese war crimes. Korea had been under Japanese rule after the collapse of the Joseon Dynasty in 1910. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japan invaded and occupied eastern China.\n\nDuring World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army perpetrated many war crimes against both Chinese and Koreans. This has caused both to oppose the Japanese government's stand on war crimes committed in during the war. Issues where both the Chinese and South Korean governments stand together include the controversial visits of Japanese politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine, the Japanese history textbook controversies, and comfort women.\n\nIn 2014, a memorial dedicated to Korean assassin An Jung-geun was opened in the Chinese city of Harbin, where he assassinated Japanese Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi in 1909. The Japanese government protested the move, referring to An as a \"terrorist\".\n\n\nhttp://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/04/16/0200000000AEN20170416002300315.html\nhttp://time.com/4734066/south-korea-tourism-china-thaad/\nhttps://www.inquisitr.com/4216299/president-moon-jae-in-on-thaad-and-hallyu-efforts-are-on-to-lift-chinas-ban-on-k-pop-k-drama/\nDebate on the THAAD Deployment in Korea and Policy Implications\n\n", "id": "7714083", "categories": ["Bilateral relations of China", "China–South Korea relations", "Bilateral relations of South Korea"], "title": "China–South Korea relations"}

The station is owned by Cox Media Group, and airs a News/Talk radio format with nationally syndicated programming from Fox News Radio, the Westwood One Network and Premiere Networks. Its studios are co-located at 1611 South Main Street in Dayton with its partners: 95.7 WHIO-FM, Channel 7 WHIO-TV, the \"Dayton Daily News\" and two more radio stations in the Cox Media Center building.\n\nWHIO broadcasts with a power of 5,000 watts 24 hours a day from a transmitter near East David Road in Kettering, Ohio. The antenna is non-directional in the daytime, but it operates with a directional antenna at night using a three-tower array, to avoid interfering with other stations at 1290 kHz.\n\nWHIO is home to popular syndicated talk radio shows such as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Brian Kilmeade, Dana Loesch, and Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. WHIO also carries Clark Howard, based at Cox Radio's flagship station WSB Atlanta. \"Miami Valley's Morning News\" is WHIO's news and interview wake-up show from 5 to 9 am weekdays. On weekends the station airs shows on money, health, cars, guns, and gardening. Some weekend shows are paid brokered programming. WHIO serves as the broadcast home for University of Dayton football and basketball. The station is a Fox News Radio network affiliate.\n\nWHIO was Cox Radio's first station started by company founder Ohio Governor James M. Cox in 1935 in the \"Dayton Daily News\" building downtown. To create a new radio service in Dayton, Cox had to purchase WLBW in Oil City, Pennsylvania, from the Petroleum Telephone Company and shut down that operation and move the radio service to Dayton. The station was first broadcast on 1260 kHz which was the frequency of WLBW, but in the early 1940s it moved to the 1290 kHz frequency where it currently resides due to the FCC frequency change legislation that was passed in 1941. 90% of all AM stations in America were forced to change frequencies. \n\nAt its founding, WHIO was an NBC Red Network affiliate. During the 1970s, while it carried a Middle of the Road format, WHIO was affiliated with CBS.\n\nWHIO's long history in the market included Lou Emm. Emm started at WHIO in the early 1940s and retired in 1992. When Emm died a few years later, all Dayton radio stations paused for a moment of silence. Phil Donahue started at WHIO as the host of the weekday talk show \"Conversation Piece\" in the 1960s before his move to television and competitor Channel 2 WLWD (now WDTN) in 1967. His show became nationally syndicated beginning in 1970. During this era, Winston Hoehner was news director at WHIO-AM for 25 years and was a member of the Ohio Associated Press Broadcast Journalism Hall of Fame. He died in 1990.\n\nThe format of the station during the most of its music era was \"Middle of the Road.\" WHIO was the originating station of a regional news network in the 1960s and '70s which was aired late afternoons on stations in surrounding communities throughout the Miami Valley as \"The DP&L News Network\"(for its sponsor, The Dayton Power and Light Company). A similar network aired in the 1990s during this same time frame as \"The Newscenter 7 Radio Network.\"\n\nOn October 30, 2006, Cox Radio pulled the plug on the all-1980's format on WDPT (95.7 The Point) and it now simulcasts WHIO's News/Talk format on the 95.7 FM frequency. 95.7 is 50,000 watts and covers the entire south central Ohio region and reaches into Eastern Indiana.\n\nThe following comes from a station history written on January 14, 1965. It was discovered inside a box of reel to reel tape at the station in 2007, written on the letterhead of the Miami Valley Broadcasting Corporation (which was a division of Cox Broadcasting Corporation then.)

Nolan, Jr., USN, in command.\n\nAfter shakedown at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, \"Noa\" departed her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia for her first Mediterranean deployment. She called at Gibraltar, Nice, Naples, Malta, Venice, Piraeus, and Lisbon. After participating in fleet maneuvers in the South Atlantic in early 1947, the \"Noa\" returned to the United States. For the next two years she exercised in type training, underwent overhaul, and acted as school training ship for the Fleet Sonar School in Key West, Florida.\n\nThe \"Noa\" served as rescue destroyer for the aircraft carrier during June and July 1949. From September 1949 through January 1951, she engaged in extended antisubmarine warfare training in a permanent ASW hunter-killer group as a unit of Destroyer Squadron Eight (DesRon 8). She also made a second Mediterranean deployment during this period. In early 1951 she participated in Convex II, a large scale convoy escort exercise, after which she called at Baltimore, Maryland. The next two years were devoted to upkeep and operational training along the East coast.\n\nIn August 1953, the \"Noa\" departed from Norfolk on a 42,000-mile (78,000 km) around-the-world cruise. She arrived Sasebo, Japan on 3 October and spent four months operating in the Sea of Japan with Task Force 77. Here she participated in operational readiness exercises while maintaining truce patrol off the Korean coast.\n\nIn November 1953, the \"Noa\" operated in Japanese waters as part of a hunter-killer group. She patrolled the Korean coast together with the in late November and early December. From then until her return to the United States in April 1954, the \"Noa\" engaged in underway training. Upon her return to Norfolk, she was reassigned to hunter-killer duty in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOn 7 September 1954, the \"Noa\" left Norfolk to participate in a joint NATO antisubmarine warfare exercise named \"Black Jack\". After visiting Derry, Northern Ireland, and ports in the Mediterranean, she was due to return to Norfolk on 12 November 1954. After leaving Gibraltar, the destroyer group was caught in hurricane force winds reaching . The \"Noa\" recorded rolls in excess of 50 degrees, Some of the destroyers sustained heavy damage in the storm. The \"Noa\" and the other destroyers found safe haven at the port of Ponta Delgada on São Miguel Island in the Azores. The destroyer group, along with the aircraft carrier , arrived at Norfolk one day late, on 13 November 1954. After returning, the \"Noa\" reported to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia for an overhaul.\n\nDuring the overhaul in the summer of 1955, the \"Noa\" was outfitted with experimental sonar equipment that she tested in the Key West area. She departed Norfolk Naval Shipyard in February 1956 for her third Mediterranean deployment. Upon return to homeport the following summer, she trained in the eastern Atlantic. In the spring 1957 she steamed to the Caribbean for Operation Springboard 1–57 and Desairdex 1–57.\n\nAfter completion of a three-month overhaul at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in August 1957 she steamed for five weeks of refresher training at Guantanamo and for shore bombardment exercises at Culebra Island, Puerto Rico. In winter of 1957–8, \"Noa\" served as test ship for experimental radio equipment and in spring 1958 she was again taking part in Springboard exercises in the Caribbean.\n\nMarch 1957 saw the \"Noa\" as a participant in Lantphibex 1–58, an exercise designed to test the latest amphibious warfare concepts. During the summer of 1958, the \"Noa\" took part in 6th Fleet operations during the Lebanon crisis. After a short tour in the Persian Gulf she returned to Norfolk and joined the 2nd Fleet for Lantphibex 2–58.\n\nIn February 1959, the \"Noa\" was again deployed to the Mediterranean. She participated in Sixth Fleet exercises through 1 April when she steamed for the Middle East via the Suez Canal. She called at Massawa, Ethiopia; Bombay, India; Bahrain; Saudi Arabia; Bandar Shahpur, Iran; and Aden. In late June, the \"Noa\" rejoined the Sixth Fleet after having gone eighty-three days without replenishment. She returned to Norfolk on 1 September, and then transferred from Destroyer Squadron Six to Squadron Fourteen, with a new homeport at Mayport, Florida. Through spring 1960 she operated off the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean, She entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 25 May for a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM), and she received the latest in antisubmarine warfare (ASW) equipment.\n\nThe \"Noa\" completed her FRAM I overhaul on 2 May 1961, and she rejoined the Atlantic Fleet. After a four-week ready-for-sea period and ASROC qualification trials, she reported to Fleet Training Command, Guantanamo, for six weeks refresher training. \"Noa\" returned to Mayport on 23 July for a two-week destroyer-tender period alongside the .\n\nTraining followed, and the \"Noa\" steamed for the United Kingdom, for combined exercises in the Eastern Atlantic with the Royal Navy. She arrived at Portsmouth, England on 6 November, and also called at Belfast and Dublin before standing in to homeport on 20 December. After leave and upkeep, the \"Noa\" resumed ASW training on 29 January 1962 in the western Atlantic.\n\nThe \"Noa\" returned to Mayport on 6 February for modifications to her boat davits and briefings in preparation for the recovery of both America's first astronaut to orbit the Earth and his spacecraft. Preparations completed, she steamed on 11 February for the Project Mercury recovery area in the southwestern Atlantic, she reported on station on 14 February as part of the 24-ship recovery task force.\n\nAfter two reschedulings of the space flight, the \"Noa\" put in at San Juan, Puerto Rico, for two days. She was underway on 19 February for the recovery station, located 200 miles WNW of San Juan. On 20 February, at precisely 14:40, five hours and 53 minutes after launch, \"Friendship 7\" reentered the atmosphere with a loud sonic boom that was clearly audible in \"Noa\". She sighted and recovered Lt. Col. John H. Glenn, Jr., USMC, Project Mercury astronaut, after he had completed three orbits of the Earth and splashed down three miles from the destroyer. Enthusiastic crewmen used white paint to draw circles around Glenn's footsteps when he stepped onto the ship's deck. Col. Glenn remained aboard \"Noa\" for three hours before a helicopter transferred him to the , the primary recovery ship.\n\nUpon completion of recovery operations, the \"Noa\" returned to Mayport for ASW operations with Task Group Alpha until on 31 May. The \"Noa\" then conducted type training and midshipmen cruises out of her homeport between Mediterranean operational deployments and upkeep. She steamed for the Mediterranean on 3 August 1962 for a seven-month tour with the Sixth Fleet and on 8 February 1964 saw her stand out of Mayport for another six-month Mediterranean deployment.\n\nHer regularly scheduled overhaul took place at Charlestown from September 1964 through January 1965, followed by a Mediterranean deployment from mid-May through 1 September. In early October 1965, the \"Noa\" steamed from Mayport for the Gemini VI recovery off the west coast of Africa. The flight was cancelled after the Agena-B rocket designed to launch a docking vehicle failed to achieve an orbital insertion.\n\nThe \"Noa\" then participated in training and Atlantic Fleet exercises, including \"High Time\", an amphibious exercise in the Caribbean from late January through early March 1966.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7714154", "text": "Senicide\n\nSenicide, or geronticide, is the abandonment to death, suicide, or killing of the elderly.\n\nSocietal views and legal repercussions have varied greatly in regards to senicide.\n\nVan Hoof, writing in 1990, examines 87 reports of older people in classical antiquity who have committed suicide. Of these suicides, he claims 20 were motivated by impatience, 17 by humiliation, 12 by vanity, and ten by suffering. Van Hoof also provides statistics for the manner of the suicide, both successful and unsuccessful. Starvation was the most widely used, accounting for 18 of the 61 cases available. Suicide via the use of weapons was second most prevalent making up 13 cases, followed by the use of poison in 11 cases. The use of various methods (seven different methods are reported in all) suggests that no particular technique was believed to be the most proper or entirely condemned. However, that Athens had a law focusing on suicide by hanging indicates that this manner of suicide was especially disdained, perhaps because the death was intimately connected with a structure that could not be easily removed, such as a tree. Thus, the act of purification, should it be deemed necessary, would be more difficult to perform.\nAncient philosophical thoughts varied greatly in this respect. Plato bifurcates suicide in \"Laws\": although killing oneself out of grief, misfortune, or state injunction is acceptable, to commit suicide “owing to sloth and unmanly cowardice” requires purification rituals and demands that the body be buried without an epitaph.\n\nAristotle viewed suicide as an unjust act: “when a man in violation of the law harms another (otherwise than in retaliation) voluntarily, he acts unjustly.” Thus, for a man to harm himself, Aristotle reasons, is an unjust act.\n\nPythagorean doctrine held that all creatures were being punished by the gods who imprisoned the creatures’ souls in a body. Thus, any attempt to alter this punishment would be seen as a direct violation of the gods’ wills. In the fourth century BC, the Hippocratic Oath was developed and reads, “I will not give a fatal draught to anyone if I am asked, nor will I suggest any such thing.” Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, euthanasia by means of a fatal draught was forbidden. However, one of the most famous examples of deviation from this code occurred when the physician of Seneca, a philosopher and tutor of Nero, provided the scholar, who was 69 years old at the time, with poison for one of his many failed attempts at suicide.\n\nThe societies of antiquity viewed suicide and euthanasia very differently from modern culture. Although factors such as better medical and psychological insight have affected contemporary society's view of suicide and euthanasia, much of the shift in opinion of these forms of death occurred because of the change in religion—that is, Greco-Roman society was dominated by pagan religions that did not categorically condemn suicide and euthanasia.\n\nMany modern Christians do not accept the practice of suicide or senicide, holding that only God should have control over a person's life and death.\n\nThe Heruli were a Germanic tribe during the Migration Period (about 400 to 800 CE). Procopius states in his work \"The Wars\", that the Heruli placed the sick and elderly on a tall stack of wood and stabbed them to death before setting the pyre alight.\n\nIn the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the illegal practice of senicide - known locally as thalaikoothal - is said to occur dozens or perhaps hundreds of times each year.\n\nA common belief is that the Inuit would leave their elderly on the ice to die. Senicide among the Inuit people was rare, except during famines. The last known case of an Inuit senicide was in 1939.\n\nUbasute (姥捨, abandoning an old woman), a custom allegedly performed in Japan in the distant past, whereby an infirm or elderly relative was carried to a mountain, or some other remote, desolate place, and left there to die. This custom has been vividly depicted in \"The Ballad of Narayama\" (a 1956 novel by Shichirō Fukazawa, a 1958 film, and a 1983 film).\n\nIn Nordic folklore, the ättestupa is a cliff where elderly people were said to leap, or be thrown, to death. While the practice has no historical evidence, the trope has survived as an urban legend, and a metaphor for deficient welfare for the elderly.\n\nSenicide as an institutionalized practice, however, seems to be much less common in ancient Rome and Greece. Parkin provides eighteen cases of senicide which the people of antiquity believed to happen. Of these cases, only two of them occur within Greek society, one within Roman society, and the rest falling outside of these two cultures. One example that Parkin provides is of the island of Keos in the Aegean Sea. Although many different variations of the Keian story exist, the legendary practice may have begun when the Athenians besieged the island. In an attempt to preserve the food supply, the Keians voted for all people over 60 years of age to commit suicide by drinking hemlock. The other case of Roman senicide occurred on the island of Sardinia, where human sacrifices of 70-years-old fathers were made by their sons to the titan Cronus.\n\nThe case of institutionalized senicide occurring in Rome comes from a proverb stating that 60-year-olds were to be thrown from the bridge. Whether or not this act occurred in reality was highly disputed in antiquity and continues to be doubted today. The most comprehensive explanation of the tradition comes from Festus writing in the fourth century AD who provides several different beliefs of the origin of the act, including human sacrifice by ancient Roman natives, a Herculean association, and the notion that older men should not vote because they no longer provided a duty to the state. This idea to throw older men into the river probably coincides with the last explanation given by Festus. That is, younger men did not want the older generations to overshadow their wishes and ambitions and, therefore, suggested that the old men should be thrown off the bridge, where voting took place, and not be allowed to vote.\nWorks of fiction which have dealt with senicide include:\n\n\n", "id": "7714154", "categories": ["Classical studies", "Old age"], "title": "Senicide"}

It was discovered at the archaeological site of Caesarea Maritima in 1961. The artifact is particularly significant because it is an archaeological find of an authentic 1st-century Roman inscription mentioning the name \"[Ponti]us Pilatus\". It is contemporary to Pilate's lifetime, and accords with what is known of his reported career. In effect, the inscription constitutes the earliest surviving, and only contemporary, record of Pilate, who is otherwise known from the New Testament, the Jewish historian Josephus and writer Philo, and brief references by Roman historians such as Tacitus.\n\nIt is likely that Pontius Pilate made his base at Caesarea Maritima - the site where the stone was discovered, since that city had replaced Jerusalem as the administrative capital and military headquarters of the province in AD 6, Pilate probably travelled to Jerusalem, the central city of the province's Jewish population, only when necessary.\n\nThe \"Pilate stone\" is currently located at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Plaster-cast replicas can be found at the Archaeological Museum in Milan, Italy, and on display in Caesarea Maritima itself.\n\nOn the partially damaged block is a dedication to the deified Augustus and Livia (\"the Divine Augusti\"), the stepfather and mother of emperor Tiberius, originally placed within a \"Tiberieum\", probably a temple dedicated to Tiberius. It has been deemed authentic because it was discovered in the coastal town of Caesarea, which was the capital of Iudaea Province during the time Pontius Pilate was Roman governor.\n\nThe partial inscription reads (conjectural letters in brackets):\n\nThe translation from Latin to English for the inscription reads:\n\nThe limestone block was discovered in June 1961 by Italian archaeologists led by Dr. Antonio Frova while excavating in the area of an ancient theatre built by decree of Herod the Great around 22–10 BC, along with the entire city of Caesarea.\n\nThe artifact is a fragment of the dedicatory inscription of a later building, probably a temple, that was constructed, possibly in honour of the emperor Tiberius, dating to 26–36 AD.\n\nThe stone was then reused in the 4th century as a building block for a set of stairs belonging to a structure erected behind the stage house of the Herodian theatre, and it was discovered there, still attached to the ancient staircase, by the archaeologists.\n", "id": "7714239", "categories": ["1st century in the Roman Empire", "Latin inscriptions", "Jews and Judaism in the Roman Empire", "1st-century Latin texts", "Early Christianity-related inscriptions", "1961 archaeological discoveries", "Archaeological artifacts"], "title": "Pilate stone"}

In his youth Ibn Ḥabib studied the Talmud under rabbi Samuel Valensi.\n\nIn 1492, when the Jews were expelled from Spain, he settled at Salonica, where he wrote his \"Ein Yaakov\" in the house of Don Judah Benveniste, grandson of Don Abraham Benveniste, who placed his rich library at his disposal. Ibn Ḥabib also availed himself of the library of Don Shemuel Benveniste the brother of Judah, which contained, among other great works, a large collection of novellæ on the Talmud by many distinguished commentators. By the aid of the works from these two libraries Ibn Ḥabib collected all the aggadic passages from the Babylonian Talmud, and many from the Jerusalem Talmud. The publication of this work began in 1516 in the printing establishment of Judah Gedaliah, the author himself carefully reading the proof-sheets; but he died at Salonica just as the first two orders (Zeraim and Moed) came from the press. His son, R. Levi, completed the labors of his father, but the work appeared before the public without the notes of the author to the last four orders (\"sedarim\"), and without the index, which the author originally intended to cover the entire work. The aggadot of the Jerusalem Talmud are also lacking.\n\nThe \"Ein Yaakov\" is the only work Ibn Ḥabib left to the world. The object of the author was to familiarize the public with the ethical spirit of Talmudic literature; at the same time his notes were intended to refute the charges brought against the Talmud by the numerous Spanish converts. The book, which thus appealed to the mass of the unlearned, became very popular. It was often edited and annotated, and served as a text-book of religious instruction. There are over thirty editions known; the latest [as of 1906] (Vilna, 1883) contains twenty commentaries, among them one which consists of selections from more than one hundred homiletic works. Of the additions, the most important one is that of Leone di Modena, under the title \"Ha-Boneh,\" which has appeared in all editions since 1684. The author's intention was chiefly to propagate a more rationalistic view of the Talmudic Aggadah.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7714430", "text": "Induced path\n\nIn the mathematical area of graph theory, an induced path in an undirected graph \"G\" is a path that is an induced subgraph of \"G\". That is, it is a sequence of vertices in \"G\" such that each two adjacent vertices in the sequence are connected by an edge in \"G\", and each two nonadjacent vertices in the sequence are not connected by any edge in \"G\". An induced path is sometimes called a snake, and the problem of finding long induced paths in hypercube graphs is known as the snake-in-the-box problem.\n\nSimilarly, an induced cycle is a cycle that is an induced subgraph of \"G\"; induced cycles are also called chordless cycles or (when the length of the cycle is four or more) holes. An antihole is a hole in the complement of \"G\", i.e., an antihole is a complement of a hole.\n\nThe length of the longest induced path in a graph has sometimes been called the detour number of the graph; for sparse graphs, having bounded detour number is equivalent to having bounded tree-depth. The induced path number of a graph \"G\" is the smallest number of induced paths into which the vertices of the graph may be partitioned, and the closely related path cover number of \"G\" is the smallest number of induced paths that together include all vertices of \"G\". The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle, but this cycle must be an induced cycle as any chord could be used to produce a shorter cycle; for similar reasons the odd girth of a graph is also the length of its shortest odd induced cycle.\n\nThe illustration shows a cube, a graph with eight vertices and twelve edges, and an induced path of length four in this graph. A straightforward case analysis shows that there can be no longer induced path in the cube, although it has an induced cycle of length six. The problem of finding the longest induced path or cycle in a hypercube, first posed by , is known as the snake-in-the-box problem, and it has been studied extensively due to its applications in coding theory and engineering.\n\nMany important graph families can be characterized in terms of the induced paths or cycles of the graphs in the family.\n\n\nIt is NP-complete to determine, for a graph \"G\" and parameter \"k\", whether the graph has an induced path of length at least \"k\". credit this result to an unpublished communication of Mihalis Yannakakis. However, this problem can be solved in polynomial time for certain graph families, such as asteroidal-triple-free graphs or graphs with no long holes.\n\nIt is also NP-complete to determine whether the vertices of a graph can be partitioned into two induced paths, or two induced cycles. As a consequence, determining the induced path number of a graph is NP-hard.\n\nThe complexity of approximating the longest induced path or cycle problems can be related to that of finding large independent sets in graphs, by the following reduction. From any graph \"G\" with \"n\" vertices, form another graph \"H\" with twice as many vertices as \"G\", by adding to \"G\" \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2 vertices having two neighbors each, one for each pair of vertices in \"G\". Then if \"G\" has an independent set of size \"k\", \"H\" must have an induced path and an induced cycle of length 2\"k\", formed by alternating vertices of the independent set in \"G\" with vertices of \"I\". Conversely, if \"H\" has an induced path or cycle of length \"k\", any maximal set of nonadjacent vertices in \"G\" from this path or cycle forms an independent set in \"G\" of size at least \"k\"/3. Thus, the size of the maximum independent set in \"G\" is within a constant factor of the size of the longest induced path and the longest induced cycle in \"H\". Therefore, by the results of on inapproximability of independent sets, unless NP=ZPP, there does not exist a polynomial time algorithm for approximating the longest induced path or the longest induced cycle to within a factor of O(\"n\") of the optimal solution.\n\nHoles (and antiholes in graphs without chordless cycles of length 5) in a graph with n vertices and m edges may be detected in time (n+m).\n\nAtomic cycles are a generalization of chordless cycles, that contain no \"n\"-chords. Given some cycle, an \"n\"-chord is defined as a path of length \"n\" connecting two points on the cycle, where \"n\" is less than the length of the shortest path on the cycle connecting those points. If a cycle has no \"n\"-chords, it is called an atomic cycle, because it cannot be decomposed into smaller cycles.\nIn the worst case, the atomic cycles in a graph can be enumerated in O(\"m\") time, where \"m\" is the number of edges in the graph.\n\n", "id": "7714430", "categories": [], "title": "Induced path"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7714431", "text": "Samuel Wadsworth Russell House\n\nThe Samuel Wadsworth Russell House is a historic house at 350 High Street in Middletown, Connecticut. It was built in 1828 to a design by architect Ithiel Town, and is described as one of the finest Greek Revival mansions in the northeastern United States. It is further notable for Town's client, Samuel Wadsworth Russell (1789-1862), the founder of Russell & Company, the largest and most important American firm to do business in the China trade in the 19th century. In 1970, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001. It is now owned by Wesleyan University and houses the Department of Philosophy.\n\nThis building was erected in 1828 for Samuel Russell (1789–1862). Russell founded the trading firm of Russell & Company in Canton, China after serving there as trading representative of the Providence, Rhode Island firm of Edward Carrington & Company. Between 1818 and 1831 Russell's fortune was made in the illegal yet highly profitable importation of Turkish and Bengal opium into the port of Canton and the exportation of fine teas and silks from there to Europe and the United States. In 1828 when his house was built Russell was in Canton, and his friend Samuel D. Hubbard worked with Mrs. Russell to supervise the building of the house. In 1831 Russell returned to Middletown and his new home where he resided until his death in 1862.\n\nThe Russell House was designed by Ithiel Town, one of the period's foremost architects and major proponent of the Greek Revival style in America. David Hoadley (of Curtis and Hoadley), a prominent New Haven builder-architect, superintended the construction. The house has the form of a Greek temple with six full height Corinthian columns supporting a heavy entablature and low flushboarded pediment. The front (west) wall has five bays with recessed panels between the first and second story windows except in the center bay, where pilasters support a high entablature over the double entrance door. This doorway is surrounded by side and overlights whose frames are decorated with fretwork. The windows on the two-bay side facades are separated vertically by panels like those on the front. Stucco scribed to resemble large block ashlar covers the brick masonry walls. The house has a brownstone foundation supported by load bearing masonry walls and a gable roof.\n\nAn antemion decorative motif is used on the portico column capitals, front corner pilasters, and in the attic window screen covers. The heavy entablature has three bands in the architrave; a band of foliated molding under the plain frieze; and a denticulated cornice defined by a bead and reel molding and an elaborate crown molding. Around 1855 the rear portico was enclosed and is now divided by six pilasters (originally square pillars) into five bays of windows with small protruding balconies in the end bays. A two-story north wing, added around 1855, is attributed to Alexander Jackson Davis, a former partner of Ithiel Town. Although not consistent with the symmetry of the whole, it is treated sympathetically through the use of identical pilasters and entablature.\n\nThe Russell estate occupied all of the block bounded by High, Court, Pearl and Washington Streets. Extensive grounds behind Russell House sloping down to Pearl Street were planted with formal gardens which included boxwood imported from England and plants brought from China by Samuel Russell. A double stair of intricate ironwork was added to the rear of the house at the time the portico was enclosed. It leads from the first floor down to the garden lawn.\n\nThe interior is divided by a spacious center hall with two rooms on either side. A stairway with landing is at the end of the hall. The four chimney stacks are placed in the outside wall of each of the rooms off the hall. The south parlors communicate through a set of folding doors, while the original north rooms have been opened up to provide a single large space.\n\nClose attention to detail characterizes the decorative treatment throughout the interior. Trompe l'oeil wall paintings simulate panelling on the walls of the north main rooms, entrance hall, and stairwell. Similarly elaborate decoration is seen in the marble fireplaces with Ionic columns supporting the mantelpieces, and in the recessed panelling of the doors and folding window shutters. A wide frieze and heavy cornice of decorative plaster define the high ceilings of the interior.\n\nThe Russell House represents a significant stage in the development of Greek Revival architecture in America, In his work \"Town and Davis, Architects\", Roger Hale Newton mentions the Russell House as \"indicative of the hand of Town in its undeniable sophistication.\" Professor Talbot Hamlin places its design \"in the richest Greek vein\" and also states that \"its Corinthian columns and open plan are urban and magnificent rather than in the simple old tradition.\" Newton elaborates on the latter point when he states that the communicating suite of parlors with their grand scale \"may have reflected an urban development quite contrary... to the prevailing modern provincial places.\" The Russell House demonstrates an early attempt by Ithiel Town to match the sophisticated design of an imposing Greek temple form with a compatible interior plan suited to living and entertaining on a grand scale. This plan was used in Town and Davis' later work in New York, and its successful application to the temple form provided a basis for vernacular interpretations of the Greek Revival style which dominated residential construction until the advent of picturesque architecture.\n\nThe construction of the Russell House in 1828 established a standard of luxury and elegance for the residential architecture on High Street during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Although many other imposing homes were built in this area of Middletown, the Russell House was never surpassed in sophistication and grandeur. It stands a monument to the personal qualities of Samuel Russell and to the exciting era of the China trade when Russell carried Middletown's mercantile tradition to its greatest heights.\n\nThe mansion faces west from the southeast corner of High and Washington Streets. The large scale of execution and the imposing qualities of the architecture enable this building to dominate the surrounding area. High Street during the 19th and early 20th centuries was the most prestigious residential area in Middletown. It is now part of the campus of Wesleyan University.\n\nAfter remaining in the Russell family for five generations, the house was deeded to Wesleyan in 1937 by Thomas Macdonough Russell, Jr. It was known as Honors College until 1996. The building is currently being used as an events facility and home to the University's Philosophy department.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7714431", "categories": ["Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut", "National Historic Landmarks in Connecticut", "Houses completed in 1828", "Wesleyan University", "Houses in Middletown, Connecticut", "Greek Revival houses in Connecticut"], "title": "Samuel Wadsworth Russell House"}

Born towards the middle of the sixth century in Cartagena, Hispania, she and her family were actively engaged in furthering the best interests of Christianity.\n\nFlorentina was the sister of three Iberian bishops in the time of the Visigothic dominion (Leander, Isidore of Seville, and Fulgentius), she consecrated her virginity to God, and all four have been canonized by the Church.\n\nShe was younger than her brother Leander, later Archbishop of Seville, but older than Isidore, who succeeded Leander as archbishop of the same see.\n\nBefore his elevation to the episcopal dignity, Leander had been a monk, and it was through his influence that Florentina embraced the ascetic life. She associated with herself a number of virgins, who also desired to forsake the world, and formed them into a religious community. Later sources declare their residence to have been the convent of S. Maria de Valle near Ecija (Astigis), of which city her brother Fulgentius was bishop.\n\nIn any case, it is certain that she had been consecrated to God before the year 600, as her brother Leander, who died either in the year 600 or 601, wrote for her guidance an extant work dealing with a nun's rule of life and with contempt for the world (\"Regula sive Libellus de institutione virginum et de contemptu mundi ad Florentinam sororem\", P.L. LXXII, 873 sqq.). In it the author lays down the rules according to which cloistered consecrated virgins should regulate their lives. He strongly advises them to avoid interaction with women living in the world, and with men, especially youths; recommends strict temperance in eating and drinking, gives advice concerning the reading of and meditation on Holy Scripture, enjoins equal love and friendship for all those living together in community, and exhorts his sister earnestly to remain true to her holy state.\n\nFlorentina regulated her life according to the advice of her brother, entered with fervour into the spirit of the religious life, and was honoured as a saint after her death. Her younger brother Isidore also dedicated to her his work \"De fide catholica contra Judæos\", which he wrote at her request. Florentina died early in the seventh century and is venerated as the patroness of the diocese of Plasencia. Her feast falls on 20 June. The name is written Florentia in the Roman martyrology, but Florentina is without doubt the correct form.\n\nAn important part of her bones was buried in the cathedral of Murcia (Spain), where are venerated nowadays. However, the biggest part of her remains are preserved in Berzocana (Spain), where she is venerated as well as her brother Fulgentius.\n\n", "id": "7714443", "categories": ["People from Cartagena, Spain", "Year of birth unknown", "Burials in Spain", "612 deaths", "Female saints of medieval Spain", "7th-century Spanish women", "7th-century Christian saints", "Medieval Spanish saints"], "title": "Saint Florentina"}

A branch to Beith was also built.\n\nIt was formed by extending the earlier independent Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, which is also described here; that line was taken over by the joint company.\n\nThe main line between Glasgow and Kilmarnock continues in operation at the present day. The station at Neilston was closed, and the locality is served by a different line.\n\nThe Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway (GB&NDR) was authorised on 4 August 1845 to build its line of nine miles (15 km) with a capital of £150,000. It was to run from a terminal on the south side of Glasgow to Crofthead, near Neilston. The location was the centre of several local industries, in the valley of the Cowdon Burn, on the Ayr Road below Neilston.\n\nTwo short branches, to Thornliebank, and to Househill were authorised in the following year, with an additional £35,000 capital.\n\nThe Glasgow terminal was somewhat remote from the city—Glasgow Bridge carried a toll at this time—but a small railway company could ill afford a central terminus.\n\nMany early railways had been simply a means to move coal and other heavy minerals from a pit to a waterway. By the 1840s it was evident that they had a more strategic role, and in 1846 a Royal Commission deliberated on the desirable location of passenger and goods terminals to serve the city of Glasgow and the quays on the Clyde.\n\nThe Caledonian Railway CR had just been authorised (in 1845) and planned to get access to the city over the route of the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway (by now transformed into the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway) which terminated at Townhead, in the north-east margin of the city. Taking a strategic view the CR hoped to get authorisation for a more central terminal, and it collaborate with the GB&NDR to promote a passenger terminal in the city centre. Together they proposed the \"Glasgow Southern Terminal Railway\", which would be located near St Enoch's Square, crossing the Clyde near Glasgow Bridge. It got as far as an authorising Act of Parliament, on 16 July 1846, but the details were left subject to approval by various authorities. In fact the Admiralty demanded a swing bridge for the Clyde crossing, and combined with other opposition, the scheme faced too much obstruction, and was reduced to the construction of a terminal station called South Side, in the angle of Pollokshaws Road and Cathcart Street.\n\nThe Glasgow Southern Terminal Railway was absorbed by the GB&NDR by Act of Parliament of 2 July 1847, which also authorised a deviation of the route. The CR also obtained authority to lease the GB&NDR line.\n\nAt this period the Ardrossan Railway had grand plans to reach Glasgow from Ardrossan, where the 12th Earl of Eglinton had expended considerable sums improving the harbour; the Ardrossan Railway was largely sponsored by him. Its natural enemy was the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR), which was building in that part of Ayrshire, and the Ardrossan company had purchased large quantities of GB&NDR shares, \"to stop the Glasgow and Ayr swamping it\". If the Ardrossan company was hostile to the GPK&AR, then the Caledonian was a friend of the Ardrossan. A physical link between the GB&NDR and the Ardrossan company had been suggested, and the Caledonian calculated that possession of the GB&NDR would give it access to much of Ayrshire, beating off the GPK&AR. In 1846 the Ardrossan Company had obtained Parliamentary authority to build a line from Crofthead, intended terminus of the GB&NDR, and Kilwinning and Kilmarnock.\n\nThe GB&NDR opened its line as far a Barrhead terminus on 27 September 1848; the station was in the Grahamston district below the town, and on the north-west side of the Water of Levern. The Glasgow station was South Side.\n\nThe 1847 Act had merely \"authorised\" the lease by the Caledonian; the terms had to be negotiated, and these were being finalised by a further Act of 1 August 1849, by which time the CR had succeeded in reducing its financial commitment to the original GB&NDR shareholders; even so the outlay was £16,500 on a 999-year lease; \"receipts were barely enough to cover the working costs\".\n\nOn 1 June 1849 the Clydesdale Junction Railway CJR was completed, terminating at South Side station. The CJR was effectively under the control of the Caledonian Railway, and trains to and from England now used the station. From 10 September 1849 trains from the Hamilton line also used the station. In that year the station was rebuilt to a design of William Tite; although cramped, the facade was imposing.\n\nIn 1865 the G&SWR promoted a Bill to build a line from Kilmarnock to Glasgow via Stewarton—the direct route which the citizens of Kilmarnock had wanted from the GBK&AR at the outset. The Caledonian responded with a Bill to extend the Glasgow Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, which they leased and worked, from Crofthead (i.e. Neilston) to Kilmarnock. Both these schemes obtained Parliamentary authority. The lines would be closely parallel, and at this time the respective shareholders strenuously made it clear that the duplicate expenditure was wasteful.\n\nAt first the compromise was that the two routes would converge at Stewarton, continuing as a single route to the G&SWR station at Kilmarnock. In fact the proposals were held in suspense for some time, until in the 1869 session a Bill was put forward merging the schemes entirely: the rival companies agreed to build the line jointly from Crofthead to Kilmarnock. This was authorised by a fresh Act of Parliament on 12 July 1869, which cancelled the two earlier Acts. The line was to be called the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Line. The G&SWR had already constructed a short length northwards from Kilmarnock, and now extended that to make an end on junction with the GB&NDR line at Neilston. By then a new station had been opened at Neilston, on 27 March 1871, forming the temporary southern extremity of the GB&NDR line.\n\nThe line between Barrhead and Neilston was closed temporarily from 1 May 1870 to enable the doubling of the line; the new Neilston station was located a short distance on the Kilmarnock side of the former location.\n\nThe 1869 Act had authorised building a short connecting line from near South Side to the City of Glasgow Union Railway, which had been authorised in 1863, so as to enable G&SWR trains on the Kilmarnock line to reach the planned St Enoch (passenger) and College (goods) terminals. The Act included a clause imposing a penalty of £60,000 if the through line were not ready by 28 June 1872.\n\nIn fact the deadline was not met: the line was opened only as far as Stewarton on 27 March 1871. An Act of 25 July 1872 removed the penalty as well as clarifying the City Union line connection. The through route was opened on 26 June 1873. As well as the line from Glasgow to Kilmarnock, there was a branch to Beith from Barrmill, opened on the same day. However the Glasgow terminal remained the awkwardly located South Side station: the connection towards St Enoch was not ready. The former Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway company was bought out.\n\nThe new route was difficult to operate: \"a veritable switchback\" with 3½ miles (5 km) of 1 in 67-70 on Neilston bank.\n\nThe G&SWR discontinued its passenger service from South Side station towards Kilmarnock on 1 September 1877.\n\nWhile Glasgow commuting built up in the 1960s, the outer limit of frequent passenger train services was Barrhead. The Neilston station on the line was closed, as the alternative line to Neilston High was electrified. The East Kilbride line, branching from the Kilmarnock line at Busby Junction, assumed greater importance as the housing construction there developed.\n\nThe track between Barrhead and Kilmarnock was singled as part of the rationalisation of the route in the mid 1970s following the electrification of the West Coast Main Line, with a passing loop at Lugton. However, in 2009 the section between and Lugton was redoubled, forming a dynamic loop, as part of capacity improvements between Glasgow and Kilmarnock.\n\nThe section from Strathbungo Junction to Cumberland Street Junction, by which trains reached the City Union Line from 1873, was closed beyond Langside Junction in 1973 and lifted (the remainder is still in use for freight).\n\nThe line to Beith closed to passengers on 5 November 1962 and to freight two years later.\n\nIn 1968 the severity of rationalisation was such that the line was to be closed, and trains diverted via Paisley and Dalry—the original GPK&AR route. In the event this was not done, and the Dalry - Kilmarnock route closed.\n\nThe main line is open and carries (2015) a typically half-hourly passenger service running from Glasgow to Barrhead and then all stations to Kilmarnock; in addition a half-hourly service runs from Glasgow Central to Barrhead, calling at all stations. There is a limited Sunday service.\n\nAt Lugton, there is a goods-only branch line to Barrmill Munitions Depot; however the rail facility is dormant. The route uses the first part of the Beith branch as far as Barrmill, then continuing on the former Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway route.\n\nNote: entries in italics were not passenger stations.

It has proximity to: Orhei District in north west, south-west Criuleni District, Dubăsari District (separatist territory) in the east. The landscape is predominantly plain (Nistru Middle Plain), but is in the northern part of district high altitude over 200 m, Nistru Plateau. Erosion processes with a low intensity. For the district are characteristic of soil types: chernozem (80%), brown soil, gray soil and alluvial.\n\nThe climate is of a transition from maritime climate of Western Europe, to temperate-continental Eastern Europe. Summer is warm and long, with average temperature of 22 °C in July and the winter is mild with average January temperature -5 °C. Rainfall ranges from 550–650 mm. For 10 years, three are dry.\n\nThe fauna is typical of Central Europe and includes fox, hedgehog, wild boar, deer, wild cat, otter, mink, raccoon dog and others. Of birds there are wild duck, egret, crow, quail, starling, swallow and more.\n\nForests occupy 7.5% of the district and include oak, hornbeam, linden, ash, maple and others. Plants include fescue, mugwort, bell, lentils and more.\n\nDubăsari district is located in the Nistru river basin. Nistru crosses district from north to south. In 1954 following the construction of Dubăsari hydroelectric power plant, was formed Dubăsari Reservoir, with an area of 68 km² and a length of 128 km.\n\nThis is the only district in Moldova without cities. There are a total of 15 localities: 11 communes (containing further 4 villages within):\n\n\nUstia, Holercani, Marcăuţi, Oxentea, and Molovata are situated on the western (right) bank of the river Nistru, while the other 10 villages on the eastern bank. Six of the latter (Cocieri, , Corjova, Mahala, Molovata Nouă, and Roghi) are situated north of the city of Dubăsari, itself under the control of the separatist authorities of Transnistria, and the remaining four (Pîrîta, Coşniţa, Pohrebea, and Doroţcaia) south of the city.\n\nThe village of Vasilievca, as well as considerable parts of the farmland of the villages of Cocieri, Roghi, and Doroţcaia are situated east of the Tiraspol–Dubăsari–Râbniţa road.\n\n\n\nSpecialized automobile companies, transported by bus routes for general use 35,400 passengers or 1.4 times higher than during the previous year. District is served by seven economic providers of public transport services through 12 inter-urban routes and two local routes.\nTraditional Dubăsari district, political and electoral support PCRM unlike the central part of Moldova.

He is considered as the awakener (Rusyn: Будитиль, \"Budytyl’\") of the Rusyns.\n\nOleksandr Dukhnovych was born in the village of Topoľa, Austria-Hungary (now Eastern Slovakia). The son of a Greek Catholic priest, he went to a Hungarian school in Uzhhorod (1816 to 1821). Later Oleksandr studied philosophy at an academy in Košice (1821–1823), and theology at the Theological Seminary in Uzhhorod (1824–1827).\n\nIn (1827–1830 and 1832), Dukhnovych worked as an archivist and a teacher. Later, in 1833-1838, he worked as a Greek Catholic priest in remote villages of Carpathian Ruthenia (present day Zakarpattia oblast of Ukraine) and as a notary in Uzhhorod (1838–1844). Dukhnovych started to write poems in his early years. He wrote in the Ruthenian, Russian, and Hungarian languages. His early works are said to have been influenced by Hungarian Romanticism.\n\nDukhnovych supported education and cultural revival of Carpathian Ruthenians. He saw his role as a defender of Ruthenian culture against Magyarization. In 1850 Dukhnovych established the first Ruthenian cultural association, the Prešov Literary Society. The society under his guidance published a series of books. His most famous patriotic poem \"Ia rusyn byl, ies'm i budu\" (I Was, Am, and Will Be a Ruthenian) was published as part of an anthology in 1851. This poem would later become the national anthem of Carpatho-Ruthenians. Dukhnovych also published a number of pedagogical and religious books, elementary school textbook and a Grammar. His most famous scholarly works were \"The History of the Eparchy of Prjašev\" (1877), originally published in Latin and later translated in Russian and English, and a \"History of Carpathian Ruthenians\" (1853).\n\nHis last years were devoted to development of education and schooling among local Ruthenians. In an effort to forestall the Magyarization of the Ruthenian population Dukhnovych founded in Prešov together with Adolf Dobryansky the St. John the Baptist Society (1862). On March 30, 1865 Dukhnovych died in Prešov.\n\nDukhnovych is regarded to be one of the outstanding Ruthenian humanists and educators. In the words of Ivan Franko \"he made everything so that forgotten Ruthenians revived spiritually\". His views were based on Christian principles and idealism.\n\nDukhnovych also actively participated in the Russophile movement in Western Ukraine at the end of the 19th century. Even though Dukhnovych wrote in the local language he did not believe it to be a separate language nor did he wish to contribute to a creation of a literary language of Carpathian Ruthenians. Instead Dukhnovych wrote his scholarly works in a peculiar dialect called iazychie made of Church-Slavonic and local Lemko-Rusyn.\n\n\n", "id": "7714658", "categories": ["1803 births", "Ukrainian poets", "Russophiles of Galicia", "Ukrainian democracy activists", "People from Snina District", "1865 deaths", "Rusyn poets", "Ukrainian people of Rusyn descent"], "title": "Alexander Dukhnovich"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7714685", "text": "Locrians\n\nThe Locrians (, \"Locri\") were an ancient Greek tribe that inhabited the region of Locris in Central Greece, around Parnassus. They spoke the Locrian dialect, a Doric-Northwest dialect, and were closely related to their neighbouring tribes, the Phocians and the Dorians. They were divided into two geographically distinct tribes, the western Ozolians and the eastern Opuntians; their primary towns were Amphissa and Opus respectively, and their most important colony was the city of Epizephyrian Locris in Magna Graecia, which still bears the name \"Locri\". Among others, Ajax the Lesser and Patroclus were the most famous Locrian heroes, both distinguished in the Trojan War; Zaleucus from Epizephyrian Locris devised the first written Greek law code, the Locrian code.\n\nIn Greek mythology, the Locrians were the descendants of Locrus, great-grandson of Deucalion and Pyrrha, the founders of the Greek race. According to some traditions, Deucalion was a native of the Locrian city of Opus, thus the Locrians are said to have been the first tribe to be called \"Hellenes\". Some ancient writers supposed the name of the Locrians to be derived from an ancient king of the Leleges, the prehistoric residents of Locris, named Locrus, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus mention that \"Locrians\" is the later name of the Leleges, in the way that many ancient writers inaccurately identified several Greek tribes with the aboriginal peoples of Greece.\n\nThe Locrians are said to have arrived in southern Greece in the late 2nd millennium BC from their homeland on Pindus, when the Greek tribes moved southwards. In historical times, the Locrians were divided into two distinct tribes, differing from each other in customs, habits and civilization. Of these, the eastern Locrians, called the Opuntian and Epicnemedian, dwelt on the eastern coast of Greece, opposite the island of Euboea, while the western Locrians, called Ozolian or Esperian, dwelt on the Corinthian gulf and were separated from the former by Mount Parnassus and the whole of Doris and Phocis.\n\nIt is likely that Locrian territory once extended from sea to sea, then was divided as a result of the immigration of the Phocians and Dorians. The most famous colony of the Locrian tribe was the city of Epizephyrian Locri, founded in the 7th century BC in Magna Græcia, which exists until today as \"Locri\". According to Strabo the founders were the Ozolian Locrians, from the region of Amphissa.\n\nIn the 6th century BC, the Locrians had a series of conflicts with the neighbouring tribes. Only the Opuntian Locrians are mentioned by Homer; they were the more ancient and the more civilized. The Ozolian Locrians, who are said to have been a colony of the former, are not mentioned in history until the time of the Peloponnesian War, and are even then represented as a semi-barbarous people. That was the last mention of the Ozolian Locrians, as they suffered the defeat from Corinth later and they stopped having a distinct identity in the 4th century BC. The Opuntian Locrians, who are mentioned to have taken part in the battle of Thermopylae between the Greeks and the Persians, were attacked by various tribes which devastated their country and only some of their towns preserved the Locrian identity in the 3rd century BC.\n\nThe Locrians around Thermopylae were the first to have been called \"Hellenes\". Later the name expanded to include the other Greek tribes through the Amphictionia of Delphi, to which they belonged, and their religion. The most famous of their heroes were Ajax the Locrian, best known as Ajax the Lesser, son of Oileus; and Patroclus, son of Menoetius and best friend of Achilles. Elements of Ajax worship have been found in Euboea, Pontus, the Aegean islands, Asia Minor, Peloponnesus, Kerkyra, Epirus, southern Italy, and northern Africa; which means that the Locrian civilization was widely extended in the ancient Greek world. In Greek mythology, the Locrians are closely related to the Phocians and Eleans.\n\nJames M. Redfield, professor of Classics at the University of Chicago, in his book \"The Locrian Maidens: Love and Death in Greek Italy\", states that the Locrians of Epizephyrian Locri had a special way to treat the sex difference. Although the Locrians hardly viewed men and women as equals, women held special religious rights, which men could gain access to only by marrying them. Locrian women became the vehicles for the transmission of status, and marriage maintained the social order of a traditional oligarchy.\n\nThe national hero of the Locrians was Ajax the Locrian, who led the 40 Locrian ships to Troy, to take part in the Trojan War. Locrians respected him so much, that after his death they kept a place for him in their phalanx, thinking that he will always fight with them. On the other side, Ajax's actions resulted in his death according to Greek mythology, while the Locrian tribe suffered from the anger of the gods. After the fall of Troy, he raped Cassandra in the temple of Athena, where she had taken refuge as a supplicant. For this crime, Poseidon wrecked the ship of Ajax on the coast of Euboea and Ajax was killed by a lightning bolt.\n\nAccording to Lycophron, in his work \"Alexandra\", for this crime of their national hero, the Locrians had to send two unmarried maidens to the temple of Athena at Ilion of Athens for 1,000 years, where they should live until they died. After their death, they would not be given a decent burial, while for each maiden who died, another one must be sent into the temple by night, and she would be stoned to death if seen. \n\nThe goddess is referred to as \"Athena Ilias\", a name not necessarily derived from Ilion, but maybe from the family deity Oileus, the father of Ajax and the ancestral hero of the Locrians. She could have protected the maidens during their period of initiation\n\nCallimachus mentions that the curse fell upon Locris three years after the Trojan war, which led to the beginning of the tribute at the command of the Delphic oracle. According to Apollodorus, after the command of the Delphic oracle, two maidens were sent to Ilion, and their duty was to clean the temple. After their death, they were replaced, while the tribute ended after a thousand years with the end of the Phocian War, which destroyed Naryca, the town that supplied the maidens. Aelian says that the plague, fell upon Locris after the Locrians failed to send the yearly tribute that the oracle demanded. Demetrius of Scepsis knows that the maidens were sent for the first time \"when the Persians were already in control\", so after 547 BC. \n\nLocrian maidens had the appearance of a Greek mourner, as they went to Ilion barefoot, wearing only one garment and their hair was loose or cut. Cut hair symbolizes maturity for both sexes and plays a part in marriage rituals, while loosened or cut hair are required in other cults such as to Demeter and Dionysus, and bare feet in other as well. In addition to these, loosened hair and bare feet are signs of a witch. \n\nThese maidens were not given proper burials, as most of them were burnt on a pyre of barren branches and the ashes were thrown to the sea. This kind of pyre was used in Greece to burn criminals and the barren trees were used to burn portents and prodigies, while criminals were hanged from these trees. Locrian maidens were seen as marginal beings and scapegoats, separated from normal life, a feature of rites of passage. The three stages of rites of passage are separation, marginalization and reincorporation, and according to this, the maidens left for Ilion, spent a year there and returned home. In Epizephyrian Locri, maidens were prostituted as a reminder and punishment for a certain act. Ancient basis for prostitution was that girls would marry earlier than their coevals and foreigners would complete the rites. The completion of the rites enhances the status of girls.\n\nIn the middle of the 6th century, this cult became more epic focused and centered on the expiation for the crimes of Ajax. As a result, later generations forgot its significance and put an end to this tribute; but a Greek inscription, discovered in Locris at the end of the nineteenth century, proves that the Locrians continued to send out pairs of maidens until the 3rd century BC.\n\n\n", "id": "7714685", "categories": ["Locris", "Ancient tribes in central Greece", "Locrians"], "title": "Locrians"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7714688", "text": "Thierry Roussel\n\nThierry Roussel (born February 16, 1953) was the fourth husband of Christina Onassis, and the only man with whom she had a child, daughter Athina Onassis Roussel. Roussel is best known as the controversial former co-trustee of his eldest child's famous fortune and for having been involved in a number of legal entanglements with the four Greek trustees of that fortune. These disputes were mostly ended (or quieted) in 1999 by the court-ordered transfer of the administration of Athina's trust to a private auditing firm.\n\nThierry Patrick François Roussel was born on 16 February 1953 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, near Paris, the son of the late Henry Julien Gaston Roussel, who was President and General Manager of the Roussel Uclaf Laboratoires Pharmaceutiques, and his wife, Francine Grinda, daughter of Jean-Paul Grinda and niece of the French politician Édouard Grinda.\n\nRoussel graduated from high school in 1972. He studied economics at Panthéon-Assas University.\n\nHe has two sisters: Patricia Roussel and Christine Roussel, the duchess of Luynes (widow of Jean d'Albert, 12th duc de Luynes). His maternal uncles are the veteran Davis Cup tennis player Jean-Noël Grinda and Olivier Grinda. The Roussel family's fortunes derive from the Roussel Uclaf pharmaceutical corporation, most famous in the US for the design of the abortifacient RU-486 (mifepristone).\n\nRoussel married Christina Onassis in 1984. They had a honeymoon in the Caribbean, but their marriage ended in divorce in 1987. Generally, the story is reported the same way, with the strong suggestion that theirs was a marriage based rather on convenience or infatuation than true love. Whatever the truth, there were certainly serious marital problems. Roussel had at least one extramarital affair during the marriage, with former Swedish model Marianne \"Gaby\" Landhage, who gave birth to their elder two (of three) children while Roussel was still married to Christina. In fact he has a son with Gaby who is only a few months younger than his daughter Athina (by Christina) For Christina's part, she suffered from bouts of serious depression and allegedly self-medicated herself with drugs and overeating. In any case, Christina and Roussel began divorce proceedings eight months after Athina was born.\n\nRoussel married Marianne \"Gaby\" Landhage in 1990 in the village church in Villeny near Bonneville, the Roussels' estate in Sologne. Athina Roussel was a bridal attendant. By then Athina was in her father's custody. Roussel and Gaby now have three children: Erik, Sandrine, and Johanna. The two older children were born during Roussel's marriage to Christina—Erik in July 1985, and Sandrine in May 1987. Johanna was born in July 1991.\n\nHe created his first company at the age of 22 and then created several publicity space rental companies, AEA, Super-média and Média Center, which were later resold to the Carat Group.\n\nIn 1987, he decided to reside in Switzerland and created the financial management company SGFC where he continues to act as President at the present time.\n\nChristina Onassis never trusted Thierry Roussel completely, which led the family to arrange for a Board of Administrators to control the family's money until Athina came of age. The trustees Christina selected to manage Athina's estate in the event of Christina's death were Stelio Papadimitriou, Paul Ioannidis, Apostolos Zabelas, Theodore Gabrielides, and Thierry Roussel. The \"four Greeks\" (the board members other than Roussel) were frequently dubbed in the media as the \"greybeards.\" During Athina's childhood and adolescence, all expenditures made on her behalf by her father (using money from the Onassis inheritance) had to be approved by the Board in advance (which led her father to threaten constantly to move back to Paris, France, with the family, where income taxes would cost the estate a \"small fortune a year\", as he put it). In 1999, a Vaduz court ordered the management of Athina's inheritance transferred from the five trustees selected by her mother to the KPMG Fides auditing firm in Lucerne.\n\nIn 2003, he created a Fund of Funds called GMT with the participation of numerous international banks.\n\nRoussel has sometimes been derided in the media for certain business decisions. The most legendary one was the investment in strawberry farms in Portugal. Some reports, like the Athens News Agency in 1998, say the result was bankruptcy. Diane Sawyer investigated the situation in doing research for her interview with Athina in 1998, and according to Sawyer, although Roussel did not actually file for bankruptcy, he did sell the strawberry farms at a loss. According to Forbes, it was a US $30 million loss.\n\nRoussel used his company, Oderfruta, to invest in the farms, with a borrowed subsidy from the European Union, which hoped that the company might create jobs and stimulate the economy in one of the poorest regions of Portugal. Roussel additionally borrowed money from the Portuguese state and a bank, but by 1994, the venture was badly debt-ridden.\n\nRoussel did not let the fiasco discourage him, however. Over the years he has had numerous business interests, from a modeling agency in Paris, boat building in Morocco, and horse breeding. The horse breeding company, called \"European Horses,\" naturally overlapped into his daughters' (Sandrine's and Athina's) passion for show jumping.

He received the Medal of Honor by the Secretary of War for the capture of a Confederate battle flag from Walthall's Mississippi Brigade of the 34th Mississippi Infantry at The Battle of Lookout Mountain, Tennessee on November 24, 1863.\n\nThe Battle of Lookout Maintain was part of the Third Battle of Chattanooga. \n\nPrivate Peter Kappesser was one of twenty men cited for personal valor in the fighting in and around Chattanooga, Tennessee, November 24 & 25, 1863. On November 24 he was one of four men of the 149th New York Infantry Regiment to earn the award for his valor at Lookout Mountain, where he captured a battle flag of Bragg's army, (Confederate States of America). Private Kappesser's company surprised a Confederate camp at breakfast and the enemy color sergeant and his color guard attempted to retreat under cover of nearby rocks. Private Kappesser boldly rushed their position, demanding their surrender, and taking their flag. He tore the flag from its staff, thrust the bunting under his coat, and then returned to the battle in order to reach a wounded comrade and carry him from the battlefield. In the cold of that night, Private Kappesser used his captured Confederate flag as a scarf around his neck, then continued to do so until the end of the battle at Missionary Ridge, whereupon he gave the flag to the commander of his regiment. \n\nThe Confederate battle flag, as described by Lt. Colonel C.B. Randall in his Commander's Report of the action, was \"...3 feet and 2 inches in length, 2 feet 8 inches in width, white border 1½ inches deep, dark blue ground-work, with round white center 14½ inches in diameter\". \n\nKappesser mustered out with his regiment in June 1865. After the war he was a member of the William Lilly Post of the GAR, Syracuse, New York, and served as its Quartermaster.\n\nHe is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Syracuse, New York near the area reserved for the William Lilly GAR (Grand Army of the Republic)Post.\n\nHistorical Note: During the Civil War, the uniquely German immigrant Company B of the New York 149th, to which Kappesser was assigned, took part in the following battles and actions: Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Wauhatchie, Lookout Mountain, Ringgold, Resaca, New Hope Church, Lost Mountain, Pine Knob, Kennesaw Mountain, Peach Tree Creek and the siege of Savannah; and they were present at the battles of Missionary Ridge, Rocky Face Ridge, Averasboro, Bentonville and The Carolinas. In total they lost 133 dead and 353 wounded.\n\nNewspaper obituary in Syracuse, New York dated June 2, 1930: \"Peter Kappesser, Holder of Medal of Honor, Dies After Operation\". He died of appendicitis at age 91 on May 31, 1930. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving Civil War veteran of the 149th Infantry, Co. B, in Syracuse.

The family was also known for its bull fighters.\n\nUnder the stage name \"El Caracol\", he \"gained international fame as much for his flamboyant personality as for his extraordinary \"cante\".\" Later his \"juergas\" (days long flamenco parties) became notorious. Although as a singer he always retained the ability to deliver the core of the traditional art, he was not ashamed to commercialize flamenco to attract a mass popularity; then he gained fame and fortune, as well as adding to a checkered reputation. For the most part, this was during what was later widely known as a decadent age in the history of the art, the age of Ópera flamenca.\n\nIn 1922 as a youth, he had been awarded the first prize (shared with El Tenazas) at the Concurso de Cante Jondo de Granada, organized by intellectuals like Manuel de Falla and Federico García Lorca. However, in the first stage of his career, he made a living singing mostly at private parties, which at the time, were, together with cafés, the usual stages for flamenco artists.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), he started touring with theatre companies as: owing to the war, private parties were difficult to find. This kind of theatre show, very common at the time (see ópera flamenca) was a musical with commonplace love stories set in Andalusian or gypsy context and their musical pieces were usually a mixture of Spanish popular song called copla andaluza or canción española. In 1943, he met Lola Flores, with whom he started an intense professional and emotional relationship. They became the most popular artistic couple in Spain during the forties, spreading their fame even to several Spanish American countries. His most popular songs in the field of copla andaluza, which he used to call zambra, date from that time: songs like \"La salvaora\" and \"La niña de fuego\" became immensely famous in Spain. He also took part in several films such as \"Un caballero famoso\" (1942), \"Embrujo\" (1946), \"Jack el Negro\" (1950) and \"La niña de la venta\" (1950).\n\nAlthough sometimes criticized by a very orthodox section of the flamenco public (mainly because of his facet as a singer of copla andaluza, a style which purists consider spurious, but also because of the irregularity of his performances), he is usually considered as one of the singers that better represent 'Duende' (a typical flamenco term which basically means \"inspiration\"). He possessed a deep, earthy, yet warm voice, and delivered the flamenco cantes (songs) with passion, originality, and extremely personal phrasing. He excelled in a wide variety of flamenco styles, including Martinetes, Seguiriyas, Soleá, Malagueñas (especially in the style of el Mellizo), Bulerías and Fandangos, among others. His renderings of Fandangos, in particular, were so personal that they have come to be known as \"Fandangos Caracoleros\".\n\nCaracol died in a road accident in Madrid, Spain.\n\nÁlvarez Caballero: \"It's true that Manolo Caracol could sink to the lowest levels, real slumps in which his singing was just a parody of itself, but this often happens to cantaores of his type, who are motivated by emotional impulse, and the knowing flamenco fan knows that this can happen. From a regular singer like Mairena we can expect he will always sing well; From somebody like Caracol (...) you could expect anything: either he was a disaster or he was an absolute genius. (Ángel Álvarez Caballero, \"El cante flamenco\", 1998)\n\nAnselmo González Climent: \"With Caracol, it is impossible to remain emotionally detached (...), from the first line, since the \"temple\" itself he starts running through our sensibility and invades us thoroughly. He forces us to take part until our egos are suppressed.\" (quoted by Álvarez Caballero in \"La discografía ideal del flamenco, 1995)\n\nRicardo Molina about Caracol's anthology \"Una historia del cante flamenco\": \"From the caña to the group of Malagueñas (flamenco style), this anthology is an evil personification of Caracol messing up the definite forms of the past.\" (quoted by Álvarez Caballero in \"La discografía ideal del flamenco, 1995)\n\nAs happens with most flamenco artists of the past, Caracol's discography is in complete disorder. His recordings are regularly republished, but in different compilations, sometimes in careless remasterizations, by different record companies.\n\n\"Una historia del cante flamenco\", originally published by Hispavox in 1958 with guitarist Melchor de Marchena remains his most seminal work. It was republished, together with other recordings, in the compilation \"El genio: Manolo Caracol\" in the Quejío CD collection published by Hispavox and compiled by J.M. Gamboa .

The Johnstons had come out to South Australia on the East Indiaman Buckinghamshire in 1839, and by the following year were opening up the country in the Onkaparinga Valley near the present site of the township. The Johnston family hailed from Oakbank, Scotland district, and hence decided to name the new township Oakbank. A large oak tree that still stands in the main street of the town was reportedly grown from an acorn carried to Australia by one of the brothers\n\nJames and Andrew Johnston founded the J. & A.G. Johnston brewery in 1845, tapping an underground spring fed by the Onkaparinga River. A second brewery was built by Henry Pike in 1889, which he named the Dorset Brewery. Both breweries were forced to shut down in 1938 due to a virus in the yeast, and therefore both turned to making soft drinks and cordials instead. Johnston's Cordial is still a popular soft drink brand, and one of South Australia's oldest family-owned businesses. The Dorset brewery site now produces hand-woven textiles.\n\nOakbank is well known for the Oakbank Easter Racing Carnival. Held over two days during the Easter weekend, thousands of visitors come to see the premiere event, the Great Eastern Steeplechase.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7714957", "text": "Muthiri kinaru\n\nMuthiri Kinaru (Tamil: முத்திரி கிணறு) is the sacred well located in the north-western corner of Swamithoppe village. This is the famous theertha of the temple. It is located half a kilometre west from the main Pathi. \n\nHistorically, this well plays a major role in joining the people in this part of the country, breaking the caste-based discrimination that once prevailed among them. Before and during the period of Lord Vaikundar, this part of the subcontinent was under the grip of feudalism, casteism, and untouchability. There were separate wells and tanks for each caste, and people from the other caste were not allowed to draw out water from those wells. As in the Vinchai, since the social aim of 'uplifting the lowely treated people in the society' occupies a major part in the spiritual mission of Vaikundar, which is projected towards the ideal Dharma Yukam, he wanted to stop this evil practice. So as the first step to reach this aim, this well was established at Swamithoppe. Apart from religious sacredness, this well was also a historical icon since it was the first well in this part of the country where people could use water freely, irrespective of their caste.\n\nBy the completion of the Six-year Tavam of Vaikundar in 1840, the Thuvayal Thavasu practiced at Vakaippathi and Muttappathi for about one year as they reached Swamithoppe. Several ritual practices of Ayyavazhi originated from this. Some, especially the prayers were continued as followed during the Thuvayal Thavasu period, and some were originated as per the instructions of Vaikundar. \n\nIn that series, Akilathirattu speaks of that well as \"the eighteen castes assembling in one place, and bathing from the same well\". This refers to the prevalence of a seemingly innocuous practice of the people, gathered around Vaikundar, bathing together from the water of this well. People of different castes bathed together at this well, mindless of their social differences. Physical closeness was necessitated, mainly because of the smallness of the well. Besides bathing, they drank this water as cure for their illness. They cooked their food with the use of this water, and eat in community feast along with Vaikundar. \n\nIn the course of events, the well and its water seem to have acquired religious significance to the people of Ayyavazhi. The act of bathing, drinking, and cooking the food with this water came to be repeated with a ritual fervour. People began to consider the well a sacred one, and the water as having miraculous powers to heal sickness. A couplet from the Saattu Neettolai of Arul Nool reads as \"every one is drinking the milk of the well around which miracles are growing\". And by this quote, it seems that Akilam itself accredits the well as a sacred one. People consider it a religious obligation to bathe and drink at least a few drops of water from this well. \n\nMany people and multiple castes congregated there to draw water for bathing and drinking. Lord Vaikuntar used the holy water from the well and the holy mud to cure the people of their illness.\n\nIn the then Travancore society, the discriminatory laws of purity and pollution were very sensitive in places of bathing, and in acts involving the use of water. Demarcation of separate places for the different castes for bathing and drawing water, and a strict enforcement of this discriminated separation through regulations, social and political, along with a strong religious sanction, was the order of the day. As a general custom, the lower castes were prohibited from drawing water from public wells and ponds. The upper caste people had separate wells so that they could avoid the presence and pollution of the lower caste people. Those who, be it a member of the caste fold or one from outside of it, ventured to transgress these demarcated spaces were penalised with severe corporal punishments, or even eliminated unceremoniously. \n\nIt was against this back ground that a ritual involving the congregation of the people from different castes around a well, bathing together, and cooking their food with the water of the same well was being performed at Swamithoppe, where Ayya Vaikundar was carrying out his mission. It was an indirect challenge to the evil system of untouchability. This cluster of ritual actions set in motion an interrogation of the system of purity and pollution, and indirectly challenged the hegemonic system of discriminated separation. The ritual boundaries that had been set on the use of water was sought to be transgressed, and the strength of the traditional indoctrination on ritual impurity implied in the exchange of water from one to another, was sought to be weakened.\n\nDue to the attention focused on the well, maliscious acts have been recorded where poison was twice placed into the water by some anti-ayyavazhi elements. One was during the period of Vaikundar and was noted in Akilam and another was in a recent time. \n\nIt is reported that Lord Vaikundar concentrated the poison into a Sivalinga and the Sivalinga remained inside the well in the first poisoning. \n\nAs per Akilam, People, hearing about the poisoning reported it to Vaikundar and requested him to save them. Vaikundar informed the devotees that the water in the well was non-poisonous. People who had faith in his words drank and bathed in the well and were totally safe. Those who had no belief in his words and had drunk the water became unconscious. People rushed to the Lord and narrated the incident. Lord asked them to sprinkle the holy water on those who were unconscious. They got up as if from sleep. \n\nThen on 17 September 1994, the first Sunday of the Tamil Month, \"Puratasi\", poison was mixed up in the sacred water of Muthirikkinaru for the second time. \n\nSome miscreants immersed a 5-kilogram packet of Phorate, a highly poisonous chemical, into the well. There was a smell of this chemical everywhere around the well. Some advised the devotees not to bathe in the well. But, nobody heeded it; thousands of people bathed in and drank the water. Even six-month-old babies were bathed here, but nobody was affected. The empty packet of the chemical was later retrieved and destroyed.\n\nThis well is treated with more importance because it is attached to the incarnational activities of Vaikundar. To overcome the three diversities, Anava, Kanma, and Maya, one should achieve spiritual cleanliness, and it is believed that this cleanliness is obtained when one bathes from this sacred well. This well is said to be sealed by Vaikundar and will remain as an icon for the destruction of Kali.\n\nEven today the well is too crowded to bathe. People drink this water as Patham. It is believed that the holy water from this well will process one for the life of Dharma Yukam. It is also believed that lunatics and patients, having no cure even after prolonged medical treatment and a stay in the temple, can take a bath in muthirikinaru and be cured. \n\nThe Muthirikkinaru is addressed in Akilam as \"Muthal Thalam\" (the primary place in ritual importance). The Payyans start their daily routine only after the religious bathing in this well. After the ceremonial bath, they used to drink the sacred water (\"Patham\") of the Muthirikkinaru for five times and give it so for the followers for five times. Then the Payyan circumambulate the Muthirikkinaru for five times and others follow him. Chanting \"Ayya Siva-siva Siva-siva Ara-hara Ara-hara\", all proceed to the Pathi. This is practiced thrice a day during the morning, noon, and evening Panividais. \n\nAlso one of the important ritual actions performed by the devotees of Ayyavazhi is to take this ritual bath, drawing water from the well. This has become a ritual necessity to be gone through, before one worships at the Pathi. It is overwhelming to see the devotees throng the well to get a few buckets of water on to them and drink a few drops ceremoniously for five times and then proceed to the Pathi. This practice of bathing at the well is being addressed as \"Patham viduthal\". \n\nApart from this daily ritual, this Muthirikkinaru earns a religious significance during the eighth day of the Kodiyettru Thirunal festival. At that day, Lord Vaikundar is carried to muthirikinaru on a horse (vahana). It is believed that the God hunts kali. The ceremonial hunting of kali is done with a bow and arrow. Here, thousands of people assemble to drink the holy patham. Patham viduthal is the word used by the devotees for bathing in Muthirikinaru. There is a heavy rush to take a bath in the well on the first Sunday of the Tamil months. \n\nArul Nool, the secondary holy book, advises to do Dharma near this well.\n\nDuring the Car festivals and during the Ayya Vaikunda Avataram celebrations, the worshippers are not allowed to draw water from Muthirikkinaru due to the limited size of the well and extent of the crowds that attend to worship. During those days, one or two Panividaiyalars are used to draw water from the well and to throw it onto the crowd. In this way the everyone in the crowd gets a few drops poured on their heads.\n\n\n", "id": "7714957", "categories": ["Ayyavazhi rituals", "Pancha pathi"], "title": "Muthiri kinaru"}

One of Stasi's most successful spies, code-named \"Kid\" or \"Uwe\", Carney became alienated and angry at the U.S. Air Force and U.S. policies under President Ronald Reagan. He began handing over U.S. military documents to the Stasi while working in West Berlin for the U.S. Air Force. After his transfer back to Goodfellow Air Force Base in 1984, Carney decided to once again request permanent asylum in East Germany. His whereabouts remained unknown until 1990 and he was carried on the rolls as a deserter.\n\nCarney was finally apprehended after the fall of the Berlin Wall by special agents of the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) on April 22, 1991,Pintschstrasse 12,in the Friedrichshain district of Berlin.\n\nCarney entered the U.S. Air Force in December 1980. From April 1982 to April 1984 he was assigned to the 6912th Electronic Security Group, Electronic Security Command at Tempelhof Central Airport in Berlin as a linguist and intelligence specialist, with duty station at the 6912th Marienfelde Field Site.\n\nIn the ZDF film \"Informationen um jeden Preis\", Carney admitted his homosexuality was the primary reason he became a spy. Carney quickly became disillusioned with the Air Force and its intelligence gathering operations, and there are several stories of him attempting to turn in his badge and quit in protest. His first-hand experiences during the NATO exercise Able Archer 83 strengthened his resolve to help avoid a nuclear conflict. Later, lonely, alienated, and under psychological stress, and he felt he had no one to talk to about his problems. He had intended to defect to East Germany on his first crossing, but he allowed himself to be drawn into espionage by East German intelligence agents who expertly manipulated him and claimed his complete loyalty.\n\nWhile working at the Marienfelde Field Site in Berlin, Carney began copying classified documents which he then provided to the Stasi by repeatedly crossing back and forth into East Germany. In 1984 he was involuntarily transferred to Goodfellow Air Force Base in Texas to work as a technical instructor. Carney believed Goodfellow was a training base with no real-world intelligence of any interest to the Stasi. He soon discovered that he had been wrong. Carney continued providing the Stasi with documents, meeting his handlers in Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro in 1985. Feeling cut off from his supervisors in East Berlin and at increasing risk in what became known as \"The Year of the Spy\" he sought out the protection of the East German embassy in Mexico City. From there he was flown to Havana with the assistance of the Cuban government. Weeks later he returned to East Berlin via Prague. There he continued to work for Stasi (HVA Abt. XI and HA III) by intercepting and translating non-secure telephone communications of U.S. military commanders as well as the East German telephone lines dedicated to the U.S. embassy in East Berlin.\n\nDuring the course of his spying, Carney provided Stasi and other Eastern Bloc intelligence services with more than one hundred top-secret U.S. military documents. For his services to East Germany, he was awarded the NVA service medal in bronze and the medal of \"Waffenbrüderschaft (Brotherhood in Arms)\" in gold. His internal Stasi file shows the value of the work he performed for the Stasi and the KGB, earning praise from KGB General Chebrikov as well as from General Zaitsev of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG).\n\nA break in the case came after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, when many Stasi records became available to foreign investigators and journalists. In April, 1991, Carney was located with the help of at least two former Stasi intelligence officers turned informants. In preparation for his apprehension, he was quickly assigned to the 7350th Air Base Group at his former base, Tempelhof Central Airport, several months before his apprehension. (Ironically, this assignment was official and had the unintended consequence of assigning Carney to a unit that supported Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1991. As a result, Carney received the National Defense Service Medal while in solitary confinement at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, several years later.) On 22 April 1991, Carney was apprehended on a public street by AFOSI agents near his residence on Pintschstraße 12, in Friedrichshain, which used to be in the Soviet sector of Berlin. Immediately following his apprehension, he was taken to Tempelhof Airport, identified, and underwent nearly 28 hours of intense interrogation; after this, Carney refused to answer any more questions after his repeated requests for counsel had been denied. At this point the AFOSI, in consultation with other U.S. agencies, decided to quietly remove Carney from German territory. He was secretly flown to the United States aboard military aircraft the following day. Carney's arrest and return to the United States was coordinated at the highest levels of the United States government without consulting German officials. The U.S. Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany, Vernon Walters, personally acted as adviser to the Commander-in-Chief, United States Air Forces Europe, urging haste.\n\nCarney pleaded guilty to charges of espionage, conspiracy, and desertion and was sentenced in December 1991 to 38 years in prison. Carney served the mandatory portion of his sentence at both Quantico, Virginia and, later, the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Carney was released in 2002, after serving 11 years, seven months, and twenty days on a twenty-year sentence in accordance with his pretrial agreement.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Carney attempted to return to Germany claiming to be a German citizen. However, as East Germany never naturalized him as a citizen and thus he had obtained his German passport fraudulently, German authorities refused to grant him a passport. He is reported to be living in Ohio. In November 2011 Carney submitted a lengthy manuscript detailing his life as a spy to the United States Air Force for security review. After numerous delays, the manuscript was finally cleared on July 26, 2012. The book, \"Against All Enemies: An American's Cold War Journey\", was published in 2013.\n\n", "id": "7714961", "categories": ["Fort Leavenworth", "Deserters", "Defectors to East Germany", "American emigrants to East Germany", "Year of birth missing (living people)", "United States Air Force airmen", "American LGBT military personnel", "Living people", "American expatriates in East Germany", "American people convicted of spying for East Germany", "National Security Agency people", "American defectors"], "title": "Jeffrey Carney"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7714999", "text": "Christian Brothers Academy (Albany, New York)\n\nChristian Brothers Academy is a private Catholic college preparatory junior and senior high school for boys founded in 1859 by the De La Salle Christian Brothers (see Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools). Christian Brothers Academy is located in the town of Colonie, New York near the Albany International Airport on a campus built in 1998. Christian Brothers Academy is independently run by a board of trustees. The school is known for its academic and athletic programs, and has had a 100% college acceptance rate since 1980. The school's athletic program also boasts numerous athletic titles. Christian Brothers Academy educates 550 students in grades 5-12 from 49 different school districts throughout the Capital Region.\n\nIn 1854, the Christian Brothers were invited to Albany by Bishop McCloskey, to open an orphan asylum for boys. To help support the asylum, the Brothers began a pay school in 1859 in which eighty boys enrolled. Stagecoaches carried the boys from downtown to the school's rural location. After a few years, a separate building on Madison Avenue was secured. In 1869, the school was chartered by the University of the State of New York and a brass band was incorporated at the school. Over the next twenty years, the school outgrew its facilities several times. Each time, it relocated to a larger site. In 1882, the school moved to Lydius Street and in 1886, the Brothers purchased the former Normal College at 43 Lodge Street from the State Education Department. Classes were conducted in this building for the next fifty-one years.\n\nDuring 1892, military training was introduced and the Civil War Zouave uniform was adopted for the cadets. Enrollment at Lodge Street followed a pattern of ups and downs. Since the lack of a suitable campus did not help attract students, the building itself became a liability.\n\nIn 1935, the Brothers realized that the dilapidated structure, nearly a century old, could no longer support the school's necessary new programs. They began a movement to secure property and funds to erect a new, modern building. Through the interest of influential friends and alumni, city and county officials in 1937 made available to the Brothers a plot of land. Popular response to the fund drive was immediate and generous. Bishop Gibbons and Mayor John Boyd Thatcher II urged all citizens of Albany to contribute. Also in 1937, CBA was accredited as a military academy was granted by the United States government. In 2012, Administration and the Board of Trustees made the decision to become a JROTC optional institution.\n\nThe De La Salle campus, featuring the Georgian Colonial school building, was opened in September 1939 in time for the school's eightieth year. The gymnasium building was added in 1942, and the Brothers' Residence in 1951. The old \"alm's house\" building on the new University Heights campus, popularly called \"the Armory\", initially housed the Rifle Range in its basement and the upper floors served as an arms room and military classroom. In later years, a Biology laboratory was added to the lower floor. One unique feature of the lab was the inclusion of live animals, which were cared for by the students. Also in this building was \"the cage\", which served as the locker room for the football and track programs. In 1991, the school added a sixth grade.\n\nEventually, the De La Salle site was in need of updating and refurbishing. The University Heights Consortium made an $8.4 million offer for the property and plans were made to move the school to the Town of Colonie. The new campus was erected with a price of $13.5 million. The new campus would feature a 75,000 square foot academic building along with a 9,000 square foot Christian Brothers Residence. The new campus on Airline Drive incorporated current technological advancements into its design and structure. Multiple science labs, a technology center, as-well-as a Lecture Hall equipped with all the latest media tools, became available to faculty and students.\n\nSince the new campus opened in 1998, the school's buildings and grounds have undergone extensive refurbishments to keep the campus updated and secure. These renovations included an expanded cafeteria, a second baseball field, and a new wing. This wing was part of the schools $5.2 million Capital Campaign that launched in 2015. The wing added a new professionally designed music room, a new STEM lab, and 4 additional classrooms to accommodate the school's growing enrollment. The school now offers over 80,000 square feet of instructional space and over 30 acres of dedicated athletic facilities.\n\nCBA currently offers a college preparatory program for young men in grades 5 through 12. In 2016, the Administration approved the addition of Fifth Grade to the school. CBA educates approximately 550 students in Grades 5-12 from 49 school districts throughout the capital region.\n\nIn the junior high school, students complete a curriculum centered on the core courses in English, social studies, math and science, as well as religion, foreign language, Fine Arts and physical education. The focus of the program is to provide students with the skills and inspiration necessary to pursue the college preparatory program of the high school.\n\nIn both the high school and junior high school, there is an honors course of study available to qualified students. In the junior high, honors students in the eighth grade will be permitted to study Algebra 1 and Biology, which are course offerings at the ninth grade level. The high school program allows students to take honors level courses in all of the core disciplines (math, science, social studies, English and foreign language) through a combination of Advanced Placement (AP) offerings and regularly scheduled courses.\n\nThe College Board offers the AP program to high schools as an opportunity for students to pursue advanced credit in specific disciplines. The school offers AP courses in Spanish V (also CHS), Statistics, Calculus, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, US History, World History, English Literature and Composition, English Language and Composition, and Computer Science. Students who wish to enroll in AP courses must meet all prerequisites for the Honors Program. Additionally, students enrolled in an AP course are required to sit for the AP exams scheduled in May, and to pay all necessary fees for the course.\n\nChristian Brothers Academy also offers courses for college credit through local colleges and universities. The school offers Advertising I, Principles of Marketing, Accounting I, Advanced Algebra and Topics, Advanced Algebra, Music Theory, Advanced Computer Applications, and CMPT 115 through Hudson Valley Community College's \"College in the High School\" program. Through the University at Albany's \"University in the High School\" program, the school offers Spanish V (also can be taken for AP credit), Spanish IV, and Pre-Calculus.\n\nChristian Brothers Academy participates in athletics under the guidelines of Section II and the New York Public High School Athletic Association. Christian Brothers Academy formerly participated in the Big 10 athletic league until its disbanding in 2014. Christian Brothers Academy joined the Suburban Council in the 2015-2016 school year. CBA's Athletics Program is classified by Section II as a \"Class AA\" school, the highest classification in New York State.\n\nCBA offers numerous athletic teams at the Varsity, JV, Freshman, and Modified levels. CYO Basketball is also offered for the middle school.\n\nCBA has a rich history of athletic championships. Most recently, the CBA Soccer team won their first ever Section II Class AA Championship by defeating Niskayuna 2-1 in October 2018. Most prominently, the CBA Basketball program has captured numerous division, sectional, regional, and state championships. Recently, the program won the Section II-Class AA title 7 years out of their record 10 straight championship game appearances from 2004-2013. CBA won sectional titles in 2004, 2005, 2006 ,2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. In 2010, Christian Brothers Academy won the New York State Class AA championship, defeating Half Hollow Hills West 71-53.\n\nThe CBA Football Team also has a rich history of success. This includes 23 League Championships, 3 Section II Championships (1985, 2006, 2013), 3-time Sectional Finalists (1982, 1999, 2014), 12 state ranked seasons (1973, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1982, 1985, 1993, 1995, 2006, 2013, 2014, 2016), and 1 Empire Division Championship (2013). As of 2010, since 1932, CBA Football had an overall record of (373-230-17). The CBA Football Team most recently won the 2013 Section 2 Class AA Championship at UAlbany's Bob Ford Field over Shaker 13-8.\n\nThe CBA Track & Field program won the New York State Outdoor Championship in 1979 and the Indoor Championship in 1981. Additionally, overall, CBA has won 19 Sectional Championships. Indoor championships include: 1978, 1979, 1980, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1994. Outdoor championships include 1978, 1979, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1986, and 1987. CBA also won numerous Big 10 Athletic Conference, Diocesan League, City of Albany and Albany County Championships.\n\nAn annual tradition between Christian Brothers Academy and rival LaSalle Institute is the \"Battle for the Sabre\" football game. The winner of the football game each year is awarded the \"Sabre\" to keep at their respective school for the year until the next year's meeting. The \"Sabre\" itself dates back to the early 1900s. The first meeting was in 1932. The schools, however, did not play in 1977-1978, 1984-2000, 2005, and 2017. The all-time series record stands at (40-21-6) with Christian Brothers Academy leading with 40 wins as of October 2018.\n\nThe academic building, built in 1998, houses grades 5-12. The building has updated classrooms, modern science labs, the 100-seat college style Lecture Hall, computer lab, 1,200 seat Ned McGraw Gymnasium, large cafeteria, the Alumni Library, art studio, brand new music studio, Cadet Chapel, administrative offices, Brother Aloysius Myers FSC Guidance Center, and other spaces. The campus now includes The Mary and Michael Ozimek Arts and Science Wing, which is a 7,200 square foot addition that includes a new music room, STEM Science lab, and new classrooms.\n\nThe 126 acre campus is also home to modern athletic facilities. Facilities include modern locker rooms, multiple Soccer/Lacrosse fields, 2 football fields, 2 baseball fields, 6 tennis courts, long and high jump pits, shot put court, discus court, pole vault pit, and the Puleo Stadium which features an all-natural grass playing field surrounded by a 400-meter running track. The running track was replaced in 2016 with a brand new surface.\n\nAlso located on the grounds is the Christian Brothers Residence. The large house is used to accommodate Brothers (DeLaSalle Christian Brothers) involved in the school, or those who are retired.\n\nChristian Brothers Academy enrolls approximately 550 students each year. During the 2017-2018 school year, the school educated 206 students in grades 5-8, and 347 students in grades 9-12.\n\nCBA's students come from a large geographic area that includes 49 different school districts. Approximately 1/4 of students live in cities, and 3/4 of students come from suburban areas. Some travel upwards of 50 miles to be a part of the CBA community and the CBA tradition. As of September 2018, the 4 largest districts of residence by enrollment were Shenendehowa, North Colonie, South Colonie, and Albany, respectively. These 4 districts make up 50% of the school's total enrollment. The next 4 largest are Guilderland, Bethlehem, Niskayuna, and Saratoga Springs. \n\nEach school day, along with numerous school functions, begins with the Lasallian call and response, \"Let us remember, that we are in the Holy Presence of God.\" A prayer follows this, ending with \"St. John Baptist de La Salle, Pray for us...Live Jesus in our hearts, Forever!\" Students are required to take a Theology class throughout their stay at CBA. School-wide masses are held monthly in the Ned McGraw Gymnasium.\n\nIn 1998, the new CBA campus opened with 379 students. By 2004, CBA's enrollment rose to 536 students, the highest enrollment the new building had seen. In 2008, the recession took a toll on enrollment and by 2008 enrollment had hit a low of 336 students. Shortly after, La Salle Institute in Troy, in a similar situation, began looking at options with CBA that included combining services or merging. In 2009, numerous open-door meetings were held at both schools. The plan would have sent students to the smaller and older La Salle Institute campus for a transitional year while the CBA campus was refurbished and further expanded. The La Salle Institute campus would have been sold. However, after months of discussion, the merger was rejected. A large financial contribution by alumni, family, and friends helped CBA recover from its struggles.\n\nSince the merger was rejected in 2009, CBA has become one of the region's leading institutions. Enrollment has rebounded from 336 students to 553 students in 2017. CBA has had the privilege of being the fastest growing private school in the Capital District. Not only has enrollment grown but so has CBA's academic program. Each year more AP, College in the High School, and University in the High School programs are being added. In the 2013-2014 scholastic year, CBA introduced a STEM program through Rochester Institute of Technology featuring courses geared toward the field of Engineering. These classes are taught in a designated, custom designed STEM lab.\n\n\nIn September 2015, CBA launched its first ever capital campaign \"Our Defining Moment.\" The campaign was a 3-year, $5.2 million campaign that focused on 7 distinct areas to renovate and upgrade the school's academic and athletic facilities. The campaign was completed in June 2018, surpassing its $5.2 million goal. \nThe school is accredited by the New York State Board of Regents, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, and the high school JROTC program, and as an \"Honor Unit With Distinction\" by the United States Department of the Army.\n", "id": "7714999", "categories": ["Private middle schools in New York (state)", "Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany", "Private schools in New York's Capital District", "Educational institutions established in 1859", "1859 establishments in New York (state)", "Catholic secondary schools in New York (state)", "Boys' schools in New York (state)", "Private high schools in Albany County, New York"], "title": "Christian Brothers Academy (Albany, New York)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715007", "text": "Opuntian Locris\n\nOpuntian Locris or Eastern Locris was an ancient Greek region inhabited by the eastern division of the Locrians, the so-called tribe of the Locri Epicnemidii () or Locri Opuntii (Greek: ).\n\nOpuntian Locris consisted of a narrow slip upon the eastern coast of central Greece, from the pass of Thermopylae to the mouth of the river Cephissus. The northern frontier town was Alpeni, which bordered upon the Malians, and the southern frontier town was Larymna, which at a later time belonged to Boeotia. The Locrians, however, did not inhabit this coast continuously, but were separated by a narrow slip of Phocis, which extended to the North Euboean Gulf, and contained the Phocian seaport town of Daphnus. The Locrians north of Daphnus were called \"Epicnemidii\", from Mount Cnemis; and those south of this town were named \"Opuntii\", from Opus, their principal city. On the west, the Locrians were separated from Phocis and Boeotia by a range of mountains, extending from Mount Oeta and running parallel to the coast. The northern part of this range, called Mount Cnemis, now Talanda, rises to a considerable height, and separated the Epicnemidii Locri from the Phocians of the upper valley of the Cephissus; the southern portion, which bore no specific name, is not so lofty as Mount Cnemis, and separated the Opuntian Locrians from the north-eastern parts of Boeotia. Lateral branches extended from these mountains to the coast, of which one terminated in the promontory Cnemides, opposite the islands called Lichades; but there were several fruitful valleys, and the fertility of the whole of the Locrian coast is praised both by ancient and modern observers. In consequence of the proximity of the mountains to the coast there was no room for any considerable rivers. The largest, which, however, is only a mountain torrent, is the Boagrius (), called also Manes () by Strabo, rising in Mount Cnemis, and flowing into the sea between Scarpheia and Thronium. The only other river mentioned by name is the Platanius, a small stream, which flows into the Opuntian gulf near the Boeotian frontier: it is the river which flows from the modern village of Proskyná.\n\nThe Opuntian Gulf, at the head of which stood the town of Opus, is a considerable bay, shallow at its inner extremity. In this bay, close to the coast, is the small island of Atalanta.\n\nThe Eastern Locrians, are mentioned by Homer, who describes them as following Ajax, the son of Oïleus, to the Trojan War in forty ships, and as inhabiting the towns of Kynos, Opus, Calliarus, Besa, Scarphe, Augeiae, Tarphe, and Thronium. Neither Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, nor Polybius, make any distinction between the Opuntii and Epicnemidii; and, during the flourishing period of Greek history, Opus was regarded as the chief town of the Eastern Locrians. Even Strabo, from whom the distinction is chiefly derived, in one place describes Opus as the metropolis of the Epicnemidii (ix. p. 416); and the same is confirmed by Pliny (iv. 7. s. 12) and Stephanus. In the Persian War the Opuntian Locrians fought with Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae, and also sent seven ships to the Greek fleet. The Locrians fought on the side of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. The Locri Opuntii also minted coins in antiquity, some of which survive.\n\nThe cities and towns of the Locri Epicnemidii, along the coast from north to south, were: Alpenus, Nicaea, Scarphe (Scarpheia), Thronium, Cnemis (Cnemides), more inland, Tarphe later Pharygae, and Augeiae. The cities and towns of the Locri Opuntii, along the coast from north to south, were: Alope, Kynos, Opus, Halae, Larymna which later belonged to Boeotia, more inland, Calliarus, Naryx, and Corseia.\n\n\n", "id": "7715007", "categories": ["Locris", "Battle of Thermopylae"], "title": "Opuntian Locris"}

The single was her 12th top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nSummer's 1980 \"The Wanderer\" album — her inaugural release on Geffen Records — had been certified gold in America although it did not enjoy numerous hit singles as some of her '70s releases had enjoyed. Summer had prepped her next album, which would be released in 1996 as \"I'm a Rainbow\" — a double set which continued her association with Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, but David Geffen, decided to cancel the project, and assigned Summer to record an album with producer Quincy Jones. Jones was a much sought-after producer at the time, particularly due to his association with Michael Jackson's album \"Off the Wall\".\n\n\"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)\" was the lead single off the Jones' produced album \"Donna Summer\". It was written by Jones and Rod Temperton (formerly of funk band Heatwave) — who'd also written Jackson's \"Rock with You\". Summer reports that the recording process for this album was challenging, as she was pregnant at the time and unhappy over \"I'm a Rainbow\"' being shelved by Geffen Records.\n\nThe single was issued in three different versions: the 7\" single release (3:42), the LP version (4:19), and a 12\" single version (7:04). The 12\" version features a \"Dance Remix\" on Side One and an \"Instrumental Version Featuring Ernie Watts On Sax Solo\" on Side Two. Both are remixes by Craig Kostich and Bruce Swedien.\n\nA music video features Donna Summer dancing in a room full of pop art. She wore a black satin outfit to disguise her pregnancy as she was expecting her baby, Amanda Grace. The video also featured clips of Donna dancing during a photo shoot wearing a blue dress with a large belt to cover her stomach. The same dress (outfit) is what she is wearing on the cover for the single and album.\n\n\"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)\" became a major hit, peaking at no. 10 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the week of September 25, 1982, giving Summer her sixteenth top 40 hit, and reaching no. 4 on the US R&B Chart. It was Summer's best R&B showing since \"Bad Girls\" in 1979—even using police whistles in the song as in \"Bad Girls\". Although the parent album was certified gold in the US, it did not produce any more major hits and did not prove the powerhouse album Geffen Records had hoped for.\n\nSummer had her biggest success in the 1980s while on Geffen's roster with her next album \"She Works Hard for the Money\" and its title song — which were released by Mercury Records in a one-off arrangement to settle Summer's split with the soon-to-be-defunct Casablanca Records, whose catalogue now resided with Mercury and Casablanca's parent company PolyGram.\n\n", "id": "7715100", "categories": ["1982 songs", "1982 singles", "2012 singles", "Songs written by Quincy Jones", "Donna Summer songs"], "title": "Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)"}

It was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\nThis large brick structure is one of three industrial buildings that share a secluded, well-kept site in South Farms district. Separated from Main Street Extension by trees and undergrowth, the landscaped grounds are behind a row of East Main Street buildings. This, the largest structure, adjoins a brick building south; nearby to the east is a large barn-like structure.\n\nSince redeveloped during the 1980s, the address of the complex is 282 Main Street Extension. The previous entrance to East Main Street still exists as an exit.\n\nThis large brick building was constructed probably a short time after the Russell Manufacturing Company obtained the property in 1884. The site, formerly developed by the Sanseer Manufacturing Company, includes a brick building which had been that company's main shop, built in 1845. The Russell Manufacturing Company, established in 1834, produced a great variety of cotton and elastic woven goods. By 1894, it was the nation's largest manufacturer of suspenders, employing 900 workers in the company's seven groups of mills. This mill, powered by steam, probably housed weaving looms as did the other two buildings nearby. These structures formed the company's Sanseer Mill complex. In 1937, Philip Bliss purchased the property, which primarily used the property for office and storage space for the P&H Bliss Company.\n\nThe structure has two dominant vertical elements: a four-story stairwell extends from the middle of one side and a tall rectangular stack stands close by. The main entrance displays a small wooden portico. Its columns and plain entablature, painted white, contrast with the building's brick walls.\n\nThis structure, one of the least altered early mills in the area, reflect the substantial development South Farms underwent following the American Civil War. During the late 19th century, the district experienced marked industrial and residential growth, primarily influenced by the success of the Russell Manufacturing Company.\n\nThe Sanseer Mill was redeveloped into modern office space in the early 1980s. During the 1990s to 2003, the building was owned by Whitney Garlinghouse, owner of The Garlinghouse Company, an architectural house plan company, which housed its offices in the complex. The old buildings were maintained in original condition at great expense. The property was purchased by Dinar Chaudhury in 2006. Unfortunately, the buildings have fallen into serious disrepair from the elements and neglect.\n\nAs of 2011, the complex is partially occupied by numerous tenants, including John Conroy, DMD of Conroy Orthodontics, Anthony Onofrio, DMD and Pamela Moore, DMD of Middlesex Dental Associates, Roger Lane, DC of the Middletown Chiropractic Center, Jeffrey Palmer, OD and Dorothy Robison Collins, OD of the Palmer Eyecare Center, New England Residential Services, RaMa Luna Yoga Studio, and New England Geosystems, LLC (GIS consultants).\n\n\n", "id": "7715131", "categories": ["Landmarks in Connecticut", "Industrial buildings completed in 1885", "Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut", "Buildings and structures in Middletown, Connecticut", "National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Connecticut"], "title": "Sanseer Mill"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715171", "text": "State of Independence\n\n\"State of Independence\" is a song written by Jon Anderson and Vangelis. Cover versions have been recorded by several artists and it has been a hit single on three occasions. The song is written in a reggae/calypso style and features an abstract spiritual lyric.\n\nOriginally recorded by Jon and Vangelis for their 1981 album \"The Friends of Mr Cairo\", \"State of Independence\" was released as a single the same year but did not chart. The song subsequently became better known when Donna Summer released a cover version a year later in 1982, which became a Top Twenty UK single (and repeated the same feat 14 years later when issued as a remixed version in 1996) and becoming a Number One hit in the Netherlands. In 1992, a third version of the song — retitled \"Spiritual High (State of Independence)\" — was recorded and released as a single by Moodswings, with vocals by The Pretenders lead singer Chrissie Hynde.\n\nJon & Vangelis released \"State of Independence\" as a single in 1981, with \"Beside\" as the B-Side. It was re-released in 1984 and this version peaked at 67 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nJon Anderson recorded a new version of the song for his solo album \"Change We Must\" (1994) and a live acoustic version can be found on his \"Live from La La Land\" (2007). More recently, Anderson also performed the song live with the AndersonPonty Band.\n\n\nDonna Summer covered \"State of Independence\" on her 1982 album \"Donna Summer\" produced by Quincy Jones. It was released as the follow-up to her hit single \"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger)\" in 1982. This version just missed the U.S. Top 40, peaking at #41. It did much better in Europe, including a one-week stay at number one in the Dutch Top 40, making it Summer's second chart-topper in the Netherlands. The single was reissued in Europe in 1990 following the release of the compilation album \"The Best of Donna Summer\".\n\nQuincy Jones assembled an all-star choir for Summer's recording, including Lionel Richie, Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Brenda Russell, Christopher Cross, Dyan Cannon, Peggy Lipton, Dara Bernard, James Ingram, Kenny Loggins and Stevie Wonder. Jones has claimed that this song was a dress rehearsal for the song \"We Are The World,\" which was written by Jackson and Richie and was produced by Jones.\n\nFollowing the dance chart success of the 1995 remix of Donna Summer's \"I Feel Love\" (and clearly influenced by the 1992 Moodswings version) PolyGram issued a remixed version of Summer's recording of \"State of Independence\". The single, released both on 12\" vinyl and CD on PolyGram's sublabel Manifesto, included mixes by Phil Ramocon, Sold Out, DJ Dero, Ralph Falcon & Oscar G, and Jules & Skins. It peaked at 13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1996, going one place higher than the original release, with the Dance mixes peaking at #1 in the UK Dance Music Charts. The Martin Luther King sample introduced by Eddie Gordon into the track was to emphasize the full independent meaning of the song as he understood it.\n\nIn 1992 the duo Moodswings released their album \"Moodfood\" (Arista), which scored a hit with a cover version of the single, retitled as \"Spiritual High (State of Independence) Pt. II\" with vocals by Chrissie Hynde (The Pretenders) and samples from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. The single peaked at 47 in the UK Singles Chart. Their version was later played during the closing credits on the soundtrack of \"Single White Female\" and it was also included on The Pretenders' \"Greatest Hits\" in 2000.\n\nKate Ceberano recorded a live version as her closing number with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra in 2006. In 2011 Andrea Corr of the Corrs recorded several versions, including one that is on her 2011 solo album \"Lifelines\".\n\nThe Art of Noise used a snippet of the song as the basis for the track 'Donna' on their debut EP, Into Battle With The Art of Noise. Having collaborated with Jon Anderson and Yes, it is likely that Art of Noise used the sample with personal permission.\n", "id": "7715171", "categories": ["Geffen Records singles", "1982 singles", "Warner Bros.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715177", "text": "Fort Belknap Indian Reservation\n\nThe Fort Belknap Indian Reservation is shared by two Native American tribes, the A'aninin (Gros Ventre) and the Nakoda (Assiniboine). The reservation covers , and is located in north central Montana. The total area includes the main portion of their homeland, as well as off-reservation trust land. The tribes reported a total of 2,851 enrolled members in 2010. The capital and largest city is Fort Belknap Agency, at the reservation's north end. This is just south of the city of Harlem across the Milk River.\n\nIn 2013, the tribes received part of a herd of bison and have re-introduced them to the local range. In June 2015, the US Department of Interior sent some 3500 offers to buy back fractionated land worth more than $54 million, affecting the future control of 26,000 tracts of land within the boundaries of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. This was under the Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations, established as part of the federal government's 2009 settlement of the landmark \"Cobell v. Salazar\" suit over federal mismanagement of revenues due Indian landowners under the trust program.\n\nIn October 1855, near the confluence of the Judith and Missouri rivers, the Blackfoot Confederacy signed an agreement to remain at peace with other Native American tribes and with citizens of the United States. The Nakoda Nation, along with the Lakota, Dakota, Mandan, Arikara, Hidatsa, Cheyenne, and Arapaho had signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1851 with the United States government in what is now North Dakota. These treaties established the tribes' sacred territories within the continental United States.\n\nThe Fort Belknap Reservation was established in 1888 in north central Montana. It comprises a small portion of the vast ancestral territory of the Blackfoot Confederacy, which consisted of the Aaniiih Nation (Gros Ventre), Northern and Southern Piegan, and Blood tribes. Their former territory extended across all of north-central and eastern Montana and portions of eastern North Dakota. Fort Belknap Reservation was named after William W. Belknap, the Secretary of War in President Ulysses S. Grant's administration. Belknap was later impeached for corruption.\n\nThe origins of the name Aaniiih, (meaning the White Clay People) is unclear. Many believe that they painted themselves with white clay found along the Saskatchewan River for ceremony, like the northern Arapaho. Early French fur trappers and traders named this tribe \"Gros Ventre.\" Other tribes in the area referred to them as \"The Water Falls People.\" Lacking a common language, they used physical signs to indicate some terms. The sign for waterfall was the passing of the hands over the stomach. The French traders interpreted this as meaning \"big belly,\" and called the \"Aaniiih the \"\"Gros Ventre,\"\" meaning \"big belly\" in the French language.\n\nThe Nakoda (meaning the Generous Ones) split with the Yanktonai Sioux in the seventeenth century. They migrated from the Minnesota woodlands westward onto the northern plains with their allies, the Plains Cree. The Chippewa called the Nakoda \"\"Assiniboine\"\" in their language, an Ojibwe word meaning \"One who cooks with stones\". The Nakoda would heat rocks and put them in rawhide pots to heat water and cook food. The Nakoda peoples live on both the Fort Belknap and Fort Peck Indian reservations in Montana and on several reserves in Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada, where they are generally known as Stoney.\n\nThe Aaniiih and Nakoda were nomadic hunters and warriors. They followed the bison, commonly called buffalo, for seasonal hunting; they made use of all parts of the massive animals, for food, clothing, cord, tools, etc. Their food, clothing, and teepees, were all derived from the buffalo. The buffalo was the Indian \"staff of life,\" supporting the nomadic cultures of the Nakoda, Aaniih, and other plains tribes. The last wild herd of buffalo in the continental United States in the nineteenth century roamed between the Bear Paw Mountains and the Little Rocky Mountains in the lush Milk River valley of Montana.\n\nToday, the two tribes are united as one federally recognized government called the Fort Belknap Indian Community. Together, the tribes have formed and maintained a community that has deep respect for its land, its culture, and its heritage. Fort Belknap derives its name from the original military and trading post established on the Milk River. The town of Chinook, Montana developed about northeast of the fort.\n\nIn March 2012, the Fort Belknap community received part of the herd of pure-bred Plains bison (\"Bison bison bison\") from Yellowstone National Park that was transferred to the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. The tribes on these reservations introduced the Bison to their local ranges, a century after they were exterminated in the area.\n\n\nGenerations after allotment was made of communal lands 94 years ago to individual tribal households under the Dawes Act, control has become split up among thousands of descendants of original allottees in many federally recognized tribes. The Fort Belknap Reservation has been described as one of the most fractionated in the country in terms of its landholdings, with an estimated 75% of land on the reservation being fractionated under individual owners.\n\nAs part of the 2009 settlement of the \"Cobell v. Salazar\" class action suit, the Department of Interior has set up the Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations to buy back such fractionated land from descendants, on a purely voluntary basis, with market value being offered. The land portions of those who accept the offers will be put in federal trust under control of the tribe, in order that it can increase the communal land base and improve its ability to manage resources for its members. In 2015 \"[m]ore than 3,500 buy-back offers were mailed to tribal landowners at the beginning of June. Some amounted to less than $100, others total tens or even hundreds of thousands [of dollars].\" In June 2015, Interior employees came to the reservation to discuss the program in more detail. They reviewed up to $54 million in offers with landowners who may be interested in selling their portions. These offers apply to 26,000 tracts of land, most very small, within the boundaries of the Fort Belknap reservation.\n\nMargey Azure, tribal coordinator of the program, believes it can help both individuals and the tribe. She said, \"We're in a position where we can consolidate these lands, and maybe even help some young Indian operators get started in the cattle ranching business or something like that.\"\n\n\n\nIncorporated in 2014, North Star Finance, LLC a payday lending entity was established.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715205", "text": "2005 Azores subtropical storm\n\nThe 2005 Azores subtropical storm was the 19th nameable storm and only subtropical storm of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was not officially named by the US National Hurricane Center as it was operationally classified as a non-tropical low. The storm developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean out of a low-pressure area that gained subtropical characteristics on October 4. The storm was short-lived, crossing over the Azores later on October 4 before becoming extratropical again on October 5. Neither damages nor fatalities were reported during that time. After being absorbed into a cold front, the system went on to become Hurricane Vince, which affected the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nMonths after the hurricane season, when the National Hurricane Center was performing its annual review of the season and its named storms, forecasters Jack Beven and Eric Blake identified this previously unnoticed subtropical storm. Despite its unusual location and wide wind field, the system had a well-defined centre convecting around a warm core—the hallmark of a subtropical storm.\n\nThe system originated out of an upper-level low just west of the Canary Islands on September 28. The low organized itself over the next days, producing several bursts of convection. While remaining non-tropical with a cold core it moved gradually west to northwest. On October 3, it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (460 mi, 740 km) southwest of São Miguel Island in the Azores. Early on October 4, convection increased as the surface low organized itself, and the system became a subtropical depression.\n\nAround the same time, the depression turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October 5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October 8.\n\nAt the time, the system was not believed to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that the system was indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.\n\nTropical storm-force winds were reported across parts of the Azores, primarily on the eastern islands. The strongest winds were reported on Santa Maria Island, where 10-minute sustained winds reached 49 mph (79 km/h) with gusts to 59 mph (94 km/h). Ponta Delgada faced 38 mph (61 km/h) winds, with the peak recorded gust being 52 mph (85 km/h). No damage or fatalities were reported.\n\nThe storm was not classified as a subtropical storm until April 10, 2006, after a reassessment by the National Hurricane Center. Every year, the NHC re-analyzes the systems of the past hurricane season and revises the storm history frequently if there is new data that was operationally unavailable. If the storm had been operationally recognized, it would have been named Subtropical Storm Tammy, and storms forming after October 4 would have been moved one name down the list. Hurricane Wilma would have been given the name \"Alpha\": a name that, had it been retired like Wilma was, could not be replaced by an \"alternate\" Greek letter, as is the convention with names on the standard A–W list. When the system strengthened into a subtropical storm on October 4, it was the earliest the 19th tropical or subtropical storm of the season formed. The old record was held by an unnamed storm in the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on October 25, 1933. It was also only the fourth time that 19 storms formed in a season.\n\n\n", "id": "7715205", "categories": ["2005 Atlantic hurricane season", "Hurricanes in the Azores"], "title": "2005 Azores subtropical storm"}

It follows a professional quarterback who finds out he has an 8-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nIt was the last film to be distributed by Buena Vista Pictures, after Disney retired the Buena Vista moniker across their company's divisions in the same year. \"The Game Plan\" was released in the United States on September 28, 2007.\n\nIn the last game of the American Football Federation regular season between the Boston Rebels and the New York Dukes, Rebels quarterback Joe Kingman (Dwayne Johnson) scores a touchdown after ignoring an open wide receiver, Travis Sanders. The next morning, an 8-year-old girl named Peyton Kelly (Madison Pettis) arrives on Joe's doorstep saying that she is his biological daughter, and that his divorced wife sent her there to meet him. His agent, Stella Peck, thinks this will be bad for his image and distracts him with the upcoming playoffs.\n\nAt the opening of his own restaurant, Joe inadvertently leaves without Peyton, and is on the cover of a tabloid the next day. Stella decides Joe needs a new fatherly image. At a later press conference, the reporters make Joe miserable, until Peyton comes to his defense, saying that he is new to this and trying the best he can, and that she thinks he is the best father in the world. Peyton then says that Joe has to repay her, so she has him take her to a ballet academy run by Monique Vasquez (Roselyn Sánchez). Monique has Joe join their ballet performance to show him that ballet takes just as much athletic ability as football. Joe and Peyton begin their relationship after Peyton calls his arrogant and selfish behavior to his attention. Joe takes Peyton and her new friends to the mall where he begins to develop romantic feelings for Monique.\n\nThe Rebels march through the playoffs via three road games: Denver in the Wild Card round, Indianapolis in the Divisional round and finally Baltimore in the Conference round. They eventually make it to the championship game held in Arizona in a rematch with the New York Dukes. Stella offers Joe a $25 million endorsement deal with Fanny's Burgers, a successful fast food restaurant run by Samuel Blake, Jr., if he wins the game and mentions the product to the press. While at lunch with Joe and Monique, Peyton accidentally reveals that her mother does not know that she is with him. She was supposed to go to a ballet school program for the month, but instead she ran away to be with Joe. Peyton then has an allergic reaction to the nuts in the dessert she was eating, and Joe rushes her to the hospital; however, the doctors tell him that the reaction is mild, and his daughter is going to be fine. \n\nJoe's former sister-in-law and Peyton's legal guardian, Karen Kelly, arrives to take her home. Joe discovers that Sara, his ex-wife and Peyton's mother, was killed in a traffic collision six months earlier, and that Peyton sneaked away on her own. After Peyton overhears Stella explaining that she would be a distraction to Joe, Karen and Peyton return home. Later, while going through Peyton's bag under her bed, Joe finds some photos and reads a letter from Sara, saying that she hid Peyton away from Joe, not wanting Peyton to be a distraction to him. As the championship game begins, Joe's mind is not fully set on the game and he is soon injured.\n\nJoe is surprised to discover that Peyton has arrived with Karen. Understanding Joe's earlier words about how he wants to remain in Peyton's life, Karen decides to let Peyton live with Joe. Near the end of the fourth quarter, Joe passes the ball to the running back, Jamal Webber, who gains positive yardage but fails to get out of bounds. Joe hurries his team to the line with the clock running, and rushes ahead before being knocked out of bounds. With time for one last play, Joe throws a lob pass to Sanders, who catches the pass, allowing the Rebels to win their first championship. In a post-game interview, Joe declines the Fanny's Burgers offer to be with Peyton.\n\nMarv Albert and Boomer Esiason portray themselves, offering commentary in every game. Steve Levy also portrays himself as part of one game's postgame coverage for \"SportsCenter\". Stuart Scott makes a cameo as himself on SportsCenter giving a report on Joe Kingman.\n\n\"The Game Plan\" was filmed in the Boston, Massachusetts area. The movie was also filmed in three stadiums across the country: Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Mile High Stadium in Denver, and Sun Devil Stadium in Arizona.\n\nJohnson's character taking ballet lessons in the movie was an indirect nod to Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Lynn Swann, who took ballet lessons during his NFL career with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Swann later worked as a reporter for Disney-owned ABC and ESPN. Swann left Disney for a career in politics while \"The Game Plan\" was in pre-production.\n\nThe film received negative reviews by critics and holds a 29% 'Rotten' rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Produced at an estimated cost of US$22 million, the film grossed $90,648,202 in the U.S market and $55,942,785 in foreign ticket sales and $50,643,312 brought from DVD sales, in its stay on the Top 50 chart, sales producing a grand total gross of $197,234,299, clearly makes this film a profitable venture for Disney. It opened at #1 at the box office grossing $22,950,971 in its first weekend in 3,103 theaters and averaging $7,396 per venue. It closed on February 18, 2008 with a final domestic gross of $90,648,202.\n\n\"The Game Plan\" was released on Disney DVD and Disney Blu-ray on January 22, 2008.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715240", "text": "The Most Dangerous Game (film)\n\nThe Most Dangerous Game is a 1932 pre-Code adaptation of the 1924 short story of the same name by Richard Connell, the first film version of that story. The plot concerns a big game hunter on an island who hunts humans for sport. The film stars Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks, and \"King Kong\" leads Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong; it was made by a team including Ernest B. Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper, the co-directors of \"King Kong\" (1933). The film was shot at night on the \"King Kong\" jungle sets.\n\nIn 1932, a luxury yacht is sailing through a channel off the western coast of South America. The captain is worried about the channel lights not matching the charts, but is quickly dissuaded from changing course by the wealthy passengers for the sake of time, including famous big game hunter and author Bob Rainsford (Joel McCrea). It is a calm evening, with the cheerful passengers relaxing over drinks and a game of cards. Bob and his companions are debating about whether hunting is at all sporting for the animal being hunted after a friend asks if he would exchange places with a tiger he had recently hunted in Africa. Bob replies that there are two kinds of people in the world: those who hunt and those who are hunted.\n\nThe ship suddenly runs aground, causing the ship to take on water and heave violently. Water floods the boiler room, causing the ship to explode and sink into the channel. Rainsford and two others manage to get away and cling to wreckage, but the other survivors are eaten by a shark. He swims to a small, lush island. Wandering through the jungle, he sees the channel lights off the shoreline change, and suspects the ship was deliberately led off course to its doom.\n\nHe stumbles across a luxury chateau where he becomes the guest of the expatriate Russian Count Zaroff (Leslie Banks), a fellow hunting enthusiast. Zaroff remarks that Rainsford's misfortune is not uncommon; in fact, four people from the previous sinking are still staying with him: Eve Trowbridge (Fay Wray), her brother Martin (Robert Armstrong), and two sailors.\n\nThat night, Zaroff introduces Rainsford to the Trowbridges and reveals his obsession with hunting. During one of his hunts, a Cape buffalo inflicted a head wound on him. He eventually became bored with the sport, to his great consternation, until he discovered \"the most dangerous game\" on his island. Rainsford asks if he means tigers, but Zaroff denies it.\n\nLater, Eve shares her suspicions of Zaroff's intentions with the newcomer. The count took each sailor to see his trophy room, on different days, and both have mysteriously disappeared. She believes their host is responsible, but Bob is unconvinced. Then Martin vanishes as well. In their search for him, Rainsford and Eve end up in Zaroff's trophy room, where they find a man's head mounted on the wall. Then, Zaroff and his men appear, carrying Martin's body. Zaroff expects Rainsford to view the matter as he does, and is gravely disappointed when Bob calls him a madman.\n\nHe decides that, as Bob refuses to be a fellow hunter, he must be the next prey. If Rainsford can stay alive until sunrise, Zaroff promises him and Eve their freedom. However, he has never lost the game of what he calls \"outdoor chess\". Eve decides to go with Rainsford. The two initially succeed in avoiding Zaroff and his dogs.\n\nEventually, they are trapped by a waterfall. When Rainsford is attacked by a hunting dog, Zaroff shoots and the young man falls into the water. Zaroff takes Eve back to his fortress to enjoy his prize. However, the dog was shot, not Rainsford.\n\nRainsford eventually shows up while Zaroff plays the piano for pleasure. Zaroff says Rainsford has beaten him and gives him the key to the boathouse, but Rainsford discovers him holding a gun behind his back. Rainsford first fights Zaroff, then his henchmen, killing the henchmen and mortally wounding Zaroff. As Rainsford and Eve speed away in a motor boat, the dying Zaroff tries to shoot them. Unsuccessful, he succumbs to his wounds. He falls out of a window into the pack of his frenzied hunting dogs.\n\n\"The Most Dangerous Game\" was filmed at night on the same sets used in \"King Kong\" (1933) with two of the same actors, Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong.\n\nThe film made a profit of $70,000 during its first year of release.\n\n\"The Most Dangerous Game\" received mostly positive reviews from critics upon its release.\nAuthor and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \"[a] Vivid telling of Richard Connell's oft-filmed story\". \nBritish magazine \"Time Out\" gave the film a positive review, praising the film's acting, and suspense, calling it \"one of the best and most literate movies from the great days of horror\".\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.7/10.\n\n\"The Most Dangerous Game\" lapsed into the public domain in 1960 and has since seen a plethora of budget releases. The first high-quality edition was via a 1995 LaserDisc from the ROAN Group. In 1999, Criterion released a restored DVD featuring an audio commentary by film historian Bruce Eder. The film was initially colorized in 1992 and again, using improved technology, in 2008 by Legend Films, who subsequently released their version on DVD alongside the B&W version.\n\nIn 2012, Flicker Alley released the film on a region-free Blu-ray; this version was restored from the original 35mm studio fine grain master by film preservionist David Shepard. The Blu-ray also included \"Gow the Headhunter\" (1931) a.k.a. \"Cannibal Island\", an audio commentary for each film and an audio interview with Merian C. Cooper, conducted by film historian Kevin Brownlow.\n\nThe Richard Connell short story has been adapted for film a number of times, and its basic concept has been borrowed for numerous films and episodes of television series (\"Gilligan's Island\", \"Lost in Space\", \"Get Smart\", \"Fantasy Island\", \"Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity\" and \"Predators\", among others).\n\nThe 1932 film was referenced in the plot of the David Fincher movie \"Zodiac\" (2007). Jake Gyllenhaal's character recognizes quotes from the film in letters from the Zodiac Killer sent to the newspaper office where he works.\n\n\n", "id": "7715240", "categories": ["Films based on short fiction", "Films directed by Irving Pichel", "Death games in fiction", "Films set in country houses", "Directorial debut films", "Films about death games", "Films about survivors of seafaring accidents or incidents", "1930s psychological thriller films", "English-language films", "Films made before the MPAA Production Code", "American thriller films", "American black-and-white films", "1930s horror films", "Films set in 1932", "American adventure drama films", "Articles containing video clips", "Films featuring hunters", "1930s adventure films", "Films set on islands", "Films directed by Ernest B.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715309", "text": "Rabbit Semiconductor\n\nRabbit Semiconductor is an American company which designs and sells the Rabbit family of microcontrollers and microcontroller modules.\nFor development, it provides Dynamic C, a non-standard dialect of C with proprietary structures for multitasking.\n\nRabbit Semiconductor was purchased in 2006 by Digi International. Before the purchase, Rabbit Semiconductor was a division of Z-World, Inc. Z-World developed and manufactured embedded controller products as well as embedded software development environments.\n\nThe Rabbit processor family shares many features with the Zilog Z80/Z180 processors. For example, the registers of a Rabbit 2000/3000 processor are almost the same as the registers of a Z80/Z180 processor. The Rabbit 4000 processor expands to include the use of 32-bit registers. The instruction set of Rabbit processors also closely resembles the instruction set of the Z80/Z180 family. While the opcodes of many instructions are the same between the Rabbit 2000/3000 processors and Z80/Z180 processors, the two families of processors are not binary compatible.\n\nThe Rabbit processor family has unique features. For example, the Z80/Z180 family disables interrupts once an interrupt is serviced by an interrupt service routine. However, the Rabbit processors permit interrupts to interrupt service routines according to priorities (a total of 4).\n\nAs with the Z80/Z180 family, the Rabbit processors are CISC processors, as opposed to RISC competitors like the Atmel AVR processors. A comparison of clocks per instruction of the Rabbit processor against a typical RISC processor like the AVR reveals that even though the Rabbit processors can use a faster clock (up to 60 MHz), the effective processing power is comparable to that of a similarly-priced AVR processor using a slower clock (up to 32 MHz). For example, the \"INC (IX+d)\" instruction requires 11 to 13 clock cycles (depending on specific processor and on operand characteristics) on a Rabbit processor. The equivalent instruction sequence (LDD, INC, STD) on an AVR requires 5 clock cycles. Another example is the \"CALL\" instruction. It requires 11 to 13 clock cycles (depending on specific processor and on operand characteristics) on a Rabbit microprocessor versus 4 to 5 cycles on an AVR processor.\nThis difference, in part, is due to the AVR using on-chip memory for both instructions and data, whereas the Rabbit uses off-chip memory for both instructions and data.\n\nRabbit Semiconductor claims that the instruction set of Rabbit processors is optimized for C code. A similar claim is made by Atmel for their AVR processors. The two architectures actually have very similar addressing modes, such as literal, register, indirect and indirect plus displacement. Furthermore, both architectures have specialized 16-bit registers. The Rabbit has IX, IY and SP, whereas the AVR has X, Y and Z.\n\nThe main difference is that the Rabbit instructions place more constraints on register usage compared to the AVR instructions. For example, the 8-bit Rabbit \"ADD\" instruction permits only the A-register be the destination. However, the \"ADD\" instruction of the AVR permits the use any one of the 32 8-bit registers as the source or destination. Generally speaking, an instruction set that is less register restrictive is more optimizable because there is less need to save-and-reload the content of a register.\n\nPerhaps the most notable feature of the Rabbit microcontroller is its development environment. Dynamic C, a product of Rabbit Semiconductor, has additions, deletions and inconsistencies compared to the ANSI-C standard.\n\n\nDynamic C follows the ISO/ANSI C standard when feasible and desirable. Because the standard does not \ntake into account the special needs of embedded systems, it is necessary to depart from the standard in \nsome areas and desirable in others. The standard does not take into account important embedded systems \nissues such as read only memory and embedded assembly language. For this reason, practical compilers \nintended for embedded systems do not completely comply with the standard, but use it as a guide. \nAs an example of an addition, Dynamic C has a \"chaining\" mechanism to chain fragments of code from different subroutines to an arbitrary number of chains. This extension permits the use of not only initialized variables, but any arbitrary code to execute before a program starts execution in the main function.\n\nAs an example of a deletion, as of version 10.23 Dynamic C does not support block scope variables or bit fields. The development toolchain does not include a separate preprocessor and linker, which may complicate the process of porting existing programs to the compiler. As of version 10.64 block scope for variables is supported.\n\nAs an example of an inconsistency, Dynamic C implicitly treats all initialized global variables as if they were declared with the codice_1 qualifier. Furthermore, all codice_1 variables reside in flash memory. Earlier versions of Dynamic C did not check the use of the codice_1 keyword in parameters—it was possible to pass a codice_1 variable as a parameter to a function that did not expect it, potentially leading to attempts to write to flash memory. As of the latest version of Dynamic C, the compiler will produce an error when the user attempts to modify a codice_1 variable directly, and will produce a warning if the user discards the codice_1 qualifier when passing a parameter to a function.\n\nOne noteworthy feature of Dynamic C is its inclusion of language constructs to simplify multitasking. These constructs, the codice_7 statement and the codice_8 statement, implement a form of cooperative and preemptive multitasking, respectively. As an example, consider the following program which flashes two LEDs with different frequencies:\n\nWhen this code is run, the first costatement will be executed, and the first LED will turn on. The costatement will then yield to the second statement while it waits for 100 milliseconds. The second costatement will execute in a similar manner. While both costatements are waiting for their time to elapse, the while loop will busy-wait, but this waiting time could potentially be used to perform other tasks. For more information, see the Dynamic C User's Manual.\n\n\n", "id": "7715309", "categories": ["Companies established in 1983", "Fabless semiconductor companies", "Electronics companies of the United States"], "title": "Rabbit Semiconductor"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715317", "text": "Ground glass joint\n\nGround glass joints are used in laboratories to quickly and easily fit leak-tight apparatus together from commonly available parts. For example, a round bottom flask, Liebig condenser, and oil bubbler with ground glass joints may be rapidly fitted together to reflux a reaction mixture. This is a large improvement compared with older methods of custom-made glassware, which was time-consuming and expensive, or the use of less chemical resistant and heat resistant corks or rubber bungs and glass tubes as joints, which took time to prepare as well.\n\nTo connect the hollow inner spaces of the glassware components, ground glass joints are hollow on the inside and open at the ends, except for stoppers.\n\nCrude versions of conically tapered ground glass joints have been made for quite a while, particularly for stoppers for glass bottles and retorts. These days, ground glass joints can be precisely ground to a reproducible taper or shape. They are made to join two glassware pieces together. One of the glassware items to be joined would have an \"inner\" (or male) \"joint\" with the ground glass surface facing outward and the other would have an \"outer\" (or female) \"joint\" of a correspondingly fitting taper with the ground glass surface facing inward.\n\nTwo general types of ground glass joints are fairly commonly used: joints which are slightly conically tapered and \"ball and socket\" joints (sometimes called spherical joints).\n\nThe conically tapered ground glass joints typically have a 1:10 taper and are often labeled with a symbol , consisting of a capital T overlaid on a capital S, meaning \"Standard Taper\". This symbol is followed by a number, a slash, and another number. The first number represents the outer diameter (OD) in millimeters at the widest point of the inner (male) joint. The second number represents the ground glass length of the joint in millimeters. Internationally the ISO sizes are used with 14/23, 19/26 and 24/29 very common in research laboratories, with 24/29 the most common. In the US the ASTM sizes (equal to the now obsolete Commercial Standard 21) are used with common sizes being 14/20, 19/22, 24/40 and somewhat 29/42. In the US 24/40 is most common.\n\n\nFor ball-and-socket joints (also known as spherical joints), the inner joint is a ball and the outer joint is a socket, both having holes leading to the interior of their respective tube ends, to which they are fused. The ball tip is a hemisphere with a ground-glass surface on the outside, which fits inside of the socket, where the ground glass surface is on the inside. Ball-and-socket joints are labeled with a size code consisting of a number, a slash, and another number. The first number represents the outer diameter in millimeters of the ball at its base or the inner diameter in millimeters at the tip of the socket, in both cases where the diameters are their maximum in the joints.\n\nThe second number represents the inner diameter of the hole in the middle of the ball or socket, which leads to the inner diameter of the tube fused to the joint.\n\nIf the angle standard taper fittings make with glassware is not perfectly set, the glass is extremely rigid and brittle, presenting a fracture risk on some setups. A ball and socket joining method allows some flexibility in the mating angles of the pieces being joined, which can be particularly important with heavy flasks or long pieces of glassware that would otherwise be difficult to support and potentially snap under bending loads. A common example of this is the collection flask on a rotary evaporator, whose weight increases significantly as it fills. A ball and socket allows the flask to plumb itself without placing a bending load on the joint. Such a socket might also be used on a larger, but more typical, distillation setup at the head and before the condenser. This allows the long span of the condenser, the non-perfect angle of the receiving bend and the filling flask to be supported more easily as their angle with the still head has a few degrees of positioning freedom.\n\nThey can also be found as the necks on pilot plant production flasks, where large volumes and masses are present, and on some Schlenk lines, where the long spans of fine glass benefit from a little flexibility between pieces. Generally, when considering smaller glassware, ball and sockets are far outnumbered by standard tapers.\n\nRound slightly spiral threaded connections are possible on tubular ends of glass items. Such glass threading can face the inside or the outside. In use, glass threading is screwed into or onto non-glass threaded material such as plastic. Glass vials typically have outer threaded glass openings onto which caps can be screwed on. Bottles and jars in which chemicals are sold, transported, and stored usually have threaded openings facing the outside and matching non-glass caps or lids.\n\nLaboratory glassware, such as Buchner flasks and Liebig condensers, may have tubular glass tips serving as hose connectors with several ridged hose barbs around the diameter near the tip. This is so that the tips can have the end of a rubber or plastic tube mounted over them to connect the glassware to another system such as a vacuum, water supply, or drain. A special clip may be placed over the end of the flexible tube surrounding the connector tip to prevent the hose from slipping off the connector.\n\nA number of brands, including Quickfit, have begun using threaded connections for hose barbs. This allows the barb to be unscrewed from the glassware, the hose pushed on and the setup screwed back together. This helps avoid accidentally breaking the glass and potentially doing serious harm to the chemist, as will sometimes occur when pushing the hoses directly onto the glass.\n\nFor either standard taper joints or ball-and-socket joints, inner and outer joints with the same numbers are made to fit together. When the joint sizes are different, ground glass \"adapters\" may be available (or made) to place in between to connect them. Special clips or pinch clamps may be placed around the joints to hold them in place.\n\nRound-bottom flasks often have one or more conically tapered ground glass joint openings, or \"necks\". Conventionally, these joints at the flask necks are outer joints. Other adapters, such as distillation heads and vacuum adapters, are made with joints that fit in with this convention. If a flask or other container has an extra outer ground-glass joint on it, which needs to be closed off for an experiment, there are often conically tapered inner ground-glass stoppers for that purpose. In some cases, small hook-like glass protrusions may be fused onto the rest of the glass item near a joint to allow an end loop of a small spring to be attached, so the spring helps keep joints temporarily together. The use of a special very small size of conically tapered fitting for glass, plastic, or metal parts called a Luer fitting or adapter has become more widespread. Originally, Luer fittings were used to connect the hub of a needle to a syringe. Where the use of ground glass presents a problem, as in the production or distillation of diazomethane (which may explode on contact with rougher surfaces), equipment with smooth glass joints may be used.\n\nTo prevent a joint from separating during a reaction process, various types of plastic or metal clips or springs can be used to secure the two sides together. They are available in a variety of materials for different temperature and chemical environments.\n\nPatented in 1984 by Hermann Keck, plastic joint clips are usually made of polyacetal, and are colored according to joint sizes. Polyacetal melts at a reasonably low temperature (around 175 °C) and begins to soften around 140 °C. As glassware temperatures are recommended up to 250 °C, care needs to be taken that clips made from this material are not being used to hold glass together that will get this hot. Typical problem areas include a flask over the plate (which may drop off the end of the column as it gets hot) and the connection the condenser makes to the still head (which will reach high temperatures and may allow the condenser to fall off). As such, different clips should be used at these points or the glassware should be clamped such that these elements can't slide apart or don't need the clip. Polyacetal clips suffer another problem in that the material is strongly affected by corrosive gases. This effect can be so dramatic that the clip will fall apart in minutes of exposure to minute quantities leaking through even greased, ground tapers. Importantly, this failure mode is sudden and without warning.\n\nPTFE joint clips are sometimes used, as its recommended temperature peak matches that of most practical chemistry work. Its highly inert nature also makes it immune to degradation around the corrosive gases. However, it is both expensive and will begin producing perfluoroisobutylene if heated to beyond its specified temperature; so care must be taken to avoid this, given the level of risk the result presents. The same is true of using Krytox and chemically resistant Molykote (PTFE thickened, fluoro based) oils and greases for glassware seals. High grade stainless steel joint clip is a final option. Naturally, this can withstand the entire temperature spectrum of borosilicate glass and is reasonably inert. Though, lower grades of stainless steel are still rapidly attacked in the presence of the corrosive gases and the clips themselves are often as expensive as PTFE.\n\nSome glassware features barbs (devil's horns, Viking helmet) sticking out the sides of the tapers. Small stainless steel springs are used on these to hold the joint together. The use of springs is of particular benefit when dealing with positive pressures, as they apply enough force for the glass to operate, but will open the taper if an unexpected excursion occurs. This method is considered quite old fashioned, but is still used on some of the most well known and high-end glassware available.\n\nFor situations where the simple spring action of metal wires or plastic is not strong enough or are not convenient for other reasons, screws can be used to hold joints together. Plastic collars are often used on microscale equipment.\n\nA thin layer of PTFE material or grease is usually applied to the ground-glass surfaces to be connected, and the inner joint is inserted into the outer joint such that the ground-glass surfaces of each are next to each other to make the connection. The use of this helps provide a good seal and prevents the joint from seizing, allowing the parts to be disassembled easily. Although silicone grease used as a sealant and a lubricant for interconnecting ground glass joints is normally assumed to be chemically inert, some compounds have resulted from unintended reactions with silicones.\n\nSometimes conical ground glass joints can lock together, preventing the user from rotating them - this is known as freezing or locking. Ball and socket-type joints are much less susceptible since they have more degrees of rotation than a conical joint. This may happen for a variety of reasons:\n\nFrozen joints may be removed by working solvent into the joint while rocking the stopper, heating the outer joint, or cooling the inner stopper. The last two methods employ the property of thermal expansion to create a small space between the two surfaces. There are also specialized glassblowing tools to unfreeze the joint.\n\n", "id": "7715317", "categories": ["Articles containing video clips"], "title": "Ground glass joint"}

When he entered an overcrowded train in Crewe, he walked up and down the corridor shouting 'All change!'. When everyone left he took a seat. He was also attacked by a man with an axe in his home. Davenport screamed 'Don't let the NHS get me!' and the assailant fled.\n\nHis son, William Arthur Bromley-Davenport, served as High Sheriff of Cheshire and Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire.

This is explained by the fact that the colliding particles have greater cross sections than the pure geometrical ones calculated from their radii, because when the particles are close enough, an electron \"jumps\" (therefore the name) from one of the particles to the other one, forming an anion and a cation which subsequently attract each other. Harpoon reactions usually take place in the gas phase, but they are also possible in condensed media.\n\nThe predicted rate constant can be improved by using a better estimation of the steric factor. A rough approximation is that the largest separation R at which charge transfer can take place on energetic grounds, can be estimated from the solution of the following equation that determines the largest distance at which the Coulombic attraction between the two oppositely charged ions is sufficient to provide the energy ΔE\n\nWith formula_2, where IP is the ionization potential of the metal and EA is the electron affinity of the halogen.\n\n", "id": "7715335", "categories": ["Chemical kinetics"], "title": "Harpoon reaction"}

While the Type 95 Ha-Go had performed well against the National Revolutionary Army of the China in the Second Sino-Japanese War and successfully engaged United States M3 Stuart light tanks on the Bataan Peninsula in December 1941, it was quickly growing obsolete. Although its 37mm gun was adequate for most light armor designed and built in the 1930s, the Ha-Go, like the tanks of the US Army prior to 1941, was not designed to fight enemy tanks, but rather to support the infantry. The Type 95's light armor made it vulnerable to .50 caliber machine gun fire and attempts to address these shortcomings via the Type 98 Ke-Ni and Type 2 Ke-To were steps in the right direction, but were still insufficient. Therefore, a complete design review was held and a prototype for a new standard light tank was completed by 1942. At this point the project was shelved, as the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff had to concede to the Imperial Navy's needs of raw materials necessary for the production of warships and warplanes. Mass production was finally authorized in 1945, by which time it was too late. Production was impossible due to shortages of materials such as steel, and the bombing of Japan.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 10, 1970.\n\nThis center-hall Colonial house faces east from the northwest corner of Washington Street Extension and Camp Street. From this site on the east slope of a ridge it commands a long view east. Although Washington Street Extension psses close by on the southwest, the house is obscured from view by thickly planted trees.\n\nJudge Seth Wetmore (1700–1788) built this house in 1746. Judge Wetmore served as deputy to the General Assembly for forty-eight terms, and was Judge of the County Court at Hartford. No doubt one of the great local mansions of its day, it remains Middletown's best example of high style Georgian architecture. the interior is of exceptional sophistication in its appointments; the northeast parlor alone is justly famous for the high quality of its decoration. It displays in original condition a corner shell cupboard with sun-burst decoration; marbleized fluted pilasters at either side of the fireplace opening, and fine overmantel painting. The woodwork in this room is in its original condition and excellently preserved.\n\nAlthough the builder of this house is unknown, it is evident that he was a master joiner. A house recorded in a Colonial Dames monograph (William Cooper House, destroyed 1930d) bears such marked similarities to this house that it is likely they were built by the same man.\n\nThis house remained in the Wetmore family for over two hundred years, and there are many traditions concerning the house including visits by Jonathan Edwards, Timothy Dwight IV, Aaron Burr and General Lafayette. A large hemlock on the property is said to have been planted by Judge Wetmore's daughter Lucy.\n\nThe Judge Seth Wetmore House is significant for its long association with the Wetmore family and as Middletown's finest example of Georgian Colonial architecture.\n\n\n", "id": "7715547", "categories": ["Landmarks in Connecticut", "Houses completed in 1742", "Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut", "National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Connecticut", "Houses in Middletown, Connecticut"], "title": "Seth Wetmore House"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715554", "text": "West Virginia Penitentiary\n\nThe West Virginia Penitentiary is a gothic-style prison located in Moundsville, West Virginia. Now withdrawn and retired from prison use, it operated from 1876 to 1995. Currently, the site is maintained as a tourist attraction and training facility.\n\nThe Penitentiary's design is similar to the facility at the 1858 state prison in Joliet, Illinois, with its castellated Gothic, stone structure, complete with turrets and battlements, except it is scaled down to half the size. The original architectural designs have been lost. The dimensions of the parallelogram-shaped prison yard are 82½ feet in length, by 352½ feet in width. The stone walls are thick at the base, tapering to 2½ feet at the top, with foundations deep. The center tower section is long. It lies at the western side of the complex along Jefferson Avenue and is considered the front, as this is where the main entrance is located. The walls here are high and wide at the base, tapering to towards the top.\n\nIn 1863, West Virginia seceded from Virginia at the height of the American Civil War. Consequently, the new state had a shortage of various public institutions, including prisons. From 1863 to 1866, Governor Arthur I. Boreman lobbied the West Virginia Legislature for a state penitentiary but was repeatedly denied. The Legislature at first directed him to send the prisoners to other institutions out of the state, and then they directed him to use existing county jails, which turned out to be inadequate. After nine inmates escaped in 1865, the local press took up the cause, and the Legislature took action. On February 7, 1866, the state legislature approved the purchase of land in Moundsville for the purpose of constructing a state prison. Ten acres were purchased just outside the then city limits of Moundsville for $3000. Moundsville proved an attractive site, as it is approximately twelve miles south of Wheeling, West Virginia, which at that time was the state capital.\n\nThe state built a temporary wooden prison nearby that summer. This gave prison officials time to assess what prison design should be used. They chose a modified version of the design of Northern Illinois Penitentiary at Joliet. Its Gothic Revival architecture \"exhibit[ed], as much as possible, great strength and convey[ed] to the mind a cheerless blank indicative of the misery which awaits the unhappy being who enters within its walls.\"\n\nThe first building constructed on the site was the North Wagon Gate. It was made with hand-cut sandstone, which was quarried from a local site. The state used prison labor during the construction process, and work continued on this first phase until 1876. When completed, the total cost was of $363,061. In addition to the North Wagon Gate, there was now north and south cellblock areas (both measuring 300 ft. by 52 ft.). South Hall had 224 cells (7 ft. by 4 ft.), and North Hall had a kitchen, dining area, hospital, and chapel. A 4-story tower connecting the two was the administration building (measuring 75 ft. by 75 ft.). It included space for female inmates and personal living quarters for the warden and his family. The facility officially opened in this year, and it had a prison population of 251 male inmates, including some who had helped construct the prison where they were incarcerated. After this phase, work began on prison workshops and other secondary facilities.\n\nIn addition to construction, the inmates had other jobs to do in support of the prison. In the early 1900s some industries within the prison walls included a carpentry shop, a paint shop, a wagon shop, a stone yard, a brickyard, a blacksmith, a tailor, a bakery, and a hospital. At the same time, revenue from the prison farm and inmate labor helped the prison financially. It was virtually self-sufficient. A prison coal mine located a mile away opened in 1921. This mine helped fill some of the prison's energy needs and saved the state an estimated $14,000 a year. Some inmates were allowed to stay at the mine's camp under the supervision of a mine foreman, who was not a prison employee.\n\nConditions at the prison during the turn of the 20th century were good, according to a warden's report, which stated that, \"both the quantity and the quality of all the purchases of material, food and clothing have been very gradually, but steadily, improved, while the discipline has become more nearly perfect and the exaction of labor less stringent.\" Education was a priority for the inmates during this time. They regularly attended class. Construction of a school and library was completed in 1900 to help reform and educate inmates.\n\nHowever, the conditions at the prison worsened through the years, and the facility would be ranked on the United States Department of Justice's \"Top Ten Most Violent Correctional Facilities\" list. One of the more infamous locations in the prison, with instances of gambling, fighting, and raping, was a recreation room known as \"The Sugar Shack\".\n\nA notable inmate in the early 20th century was labor activist Eugene V. Debs, who served time here from April 13 to June 14, 1919 (at which time he was transferred to an Atlanta prison) on charges of violating the Espionage Act of 1917.\n\nIn 1929, the state decided to double the size of the penitentiary because overcrowding was a problem. The 5 x cells were too small to hold three prisoners at a time, but until the expansion there was no other option. Two prisoners would sleep in the bunks, with the third sleeping on a mattress on the floor. The state used prison labor again and completed this phase of construction in 1959. The construction had been delayed by a steel shortage during World War II.\n\nIn total, thirty-six homicides took place in the prison. One of the more notable ones is the butchering of R.D. Wall, inmate number 44670. On October 8, 1929, after \"snitching\" on his fellow inmates, he was attacked while heading to the boiler room by three prisoners with dull shivs.\n\nIn 1983, convicted multiple murderer Charles Manson requested to be transferred to this prison to be nearer to his family. His request was denied.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 7, 1979, fifteen prisoners escaped from the prison. One of the escapees was Ronald Turney Williams, serving time for murdering Sergeant David Lilly of the Beckley Police Department on May 12, 1975. He managed to steal a prison guard's service weapon in the escape, and upon reaching the streets of Moundsville, encountered twenty-three-year-old off-duty West Virginia State Trooper Philip S. Kesner, who was driving past the prison with his wife.\n\nTrooper Kesner saw the escapees and attempted to take action against them. The prisoners pulled him from his car and Williams shot him. Trooper Kesner returned fire at the fleeing suspects despite being mortally wounded.\n\nWilliams remained at large for eighteen months, sending taunting notes to authorities and making the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. During that time, he murdered John Bunchek in Scottsdale, Arizona during a robbery and was connected to crimes in Colorado and Pennsylvania. After a shootout with federal agents at the George Washington Hotel in New York City in 1981, he was apprehended and returned to West Virginia to complete several life sentences. Arizona had sought his extradition for his execution, but as of he remains in West Virginia custody.\n\nAt the time, Marshall County Sheriff Robert Lightner was very critical about poor police communications during the break. The sheriff's office and local police did not learn about the escape from the state police. They first heard of it over the police scanner. \"It was a good twenty minutes before we knew about the escape. If somebody had notified us, there's a good chance that the sheriff's department and the Moundsville police could have been on the scene while all the prisoners were still on the block.\" He was also critical of the four-state manhunt that followed, when convicted murderers David Morgan and Ronald T. Williams, along with convicted rapist Harold Gowers, Jr., remained at large. \"Communications have been very poor. I think they should keep the local law enforcement officers more informed I have no idea what they're doing, what they've found.\"\n\nJanuary 1, 1986 was the date of one of the most infamous riots in recent history. The West Virginia Penitentiary was undergoing many changes and problems. Security had become extremely loose in all areas. Since it was a \"cons\" prison, most of the locks on the cells had been picked and inmates roamed the halls freely. Bad plumbing and insects caused rapid spreading of various diseases. The prison was holding more than 2,000 men and crowding was an issue. Another major contribution to the riot's cause was the fact that it was a holiday. Many of the officers had called off work, and prisoners planned to conduct their uprising on this specific day.\n\nAt around 5:30 pm, twenty inmates, known as a group called the Avengers, stormed the mess hall where Captain Glassock and others were on duty. \"Within seconds, he (Captain Glassock), five other officers, and a food service worker were tackled and slammed to the floor. Inmates put knives to their throats and handcuffed them with their own handcuffs.\" Although several hostages were taken throughout the day, none of them were seriously injured. However, over the course of the two-day upheaval, three inmates were killed for an assortment of reasons. \"The inmates who initiated the riot were not prepared to take charge of it. Danny Lehman, the Avengers' president, was quickly agreed upon as best suited for the task of negotiating with authorities and presenting the demands to the media.\" Yet, Lehman was not a part of the twenty men who began the riot. Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr. went to the penitentiary to talk with the inmates. This meeting set up a new list of rules and standards on which the prison would build. National and local news covered the story, as well as the inmates meeting with Governor Moore.\n\nToward the end of its life as a prison, the facility was marked by many instances of riots and escapes. In the 1960s, the prison reached a peak population of about 2,000 inmates. With the building of more prisons, that number declined to 600 – 700 inmates by 1995. The fate of the prison was sealed in a 1986 ruling by the West Virginia Supreme Court which stated that confinement to the 5 x cells constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Within nine years, West Virginia Penitentiary was closed as a prison. Most of the inmates were transferred to the Mt. Olive Correctional Complex in Fayette County, West Virginia. A smaller correctional facility was built a mile away in Moundsville to serve as a regional jail.\n\nFrom 1899 to 1959, ninety-four men were executed at the prison. Hanging was the method of execution until 1949, with eighty-five men meeting that fate. The public could attend hangings, which were public until June 19, 1931. On that date, Frank Hyer was executed for murdering his wife. When the trap door beneath him was opened and his full weight settled into the noose, he was instantly decapitated. Following this event, attendance at hangings was by invitation only. The last man executed by hanging, Bud Peterson from Logan County, was buried in the prison's cemetery because his family refused to claim his body.\n\nBeginning in 1951, electrocution became the means of execution. The electric chair, nicknamed \"Old Sparky\", used by the prison was originally built by an inmate there, Paul Glenn. Nine men were electrocuted before the state prohibited capital punishment entirely in 1965. The original chair is on display in the facility and is included in the official tour.\n\nAfter the prison closed its doors as a state institution, the Moundsville Economic Development Council obtained a 25-year lease on the complex. The facility is used for training law enforcement and corrections practitioners with regular mock-riot drills. To assist teams in the planning and execution of scenarios, the West Virginia High Technology Consortium Foundation commissioned \"The 3D Model of the West Virginia Penitentiary\", an interactive 3D model of the penitentiary. It made the software available to the public prior to conducting the 2009 Mock Prison Riot. Some previous training programs for law enforcement officials that took place here, such as the \"National Corrections and Law Enforcement Training and Technology Center\", are now discontinued.\n\nTours are available for tourists wishing to see the prison. The Elizabethtown Festival is held every May to celebrate and remember historic Moundsville. A haunted attraction called the \"Dungeon of Horrors\" is also set up for the Halloween season. Paranormal groups and enthusiast travel guides consider Moundsville Prison to be one of the most haunted prisons in the United States, with ghost stories originating as early as the 1930s. Legends include the prison occupying the site of a Native American burial ground. Reports include former guards seeing phantom inmates and a \"shadow man\" wandering the premises, as well as unexplained noises, voices, and cold spots.\n\nThe prison has been featured in a variety of books, films, television shows, songs and video games.\n\nMoundsville native Davis Grubb has written a couple of novels with Moundsville as the setting, \"Fools' Parade\" (also known as \"Dynamite Man from Glory Jail\") and \"The Night of the Hunter\". The penitentiary was featured as a significant part of each plot.\n\nThese works by Grubb have been adapted as major motion pictures. \"The Night of the Hunter\" was adapted into a film by Charles Laughton and James Agee in 1955. It stars Robert Mitchum and Shelley Winters. \"Fools' Parade\", starring James Stewart, Kurt Russell, and George Kennedy, was adapted into a film in 1971.\n\nPrison scenes in the 2013 film \"Out of the Furnace\" were filmed on site at the penitentiary.\n\nThe Hulu original series, \"Castle Rock\", based on Stephen King's work, was filmed here. In the series, the penitentiary is Shawshank. The reason this site was chosen for Shawshank instead of the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio where the movie \"Shawshank Redemption\" was filmed, is due to the showrunner's desire to make the town around Shawshank more visible.\n\nExternal shots of the penitentiary were used for Season 1 Episode 9 of the Netflix Original Series \"Mindhunter\"\n\nThe prison appears in the 2018 video game \"Fallout 76\", where it is known as the \"Eastern Regional Penitentiary.\"\n\n", "id": "7715554", "categories": ["Prison uprisings", "1986 riots", "National Register of Historic Places in Marshall County, West Virginia", "Reportedly haunted locations in West Virginia", "Defunct prisons in West Virginia", "1876 establishments in West Virginia", "Gothic Revival architecture in West Virginia", "History museums in West Virginia", "1995 disestablishments in West Virginia", "Museums in Marshall County, West Virginia", "Historic districts in Marshall County, West Virginia", "Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia", "Prison museums in the United States", "Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia"], "title": "West Virginia Penitentiary"}

The term is most often applied to luxury goods. While members of the upper middle class, or the mass affluent, are perhaps the most commonly targeted customers of these designer labels, some marquees—such as Cartier, Rolex, Montblanc and the haute couture — tend to a wealthier customer base. But almost every designer brand has merchandise that middle-class wouldn't normally be able to afford such as exotic skins, furs and hides, limited edition pieces, or things simply priced higher. Designer Label companies use their smaller and cheaper merchandise, aimed at the middle class, such as wallets, fashion jewellery, key-rings and small accessories, to make the majority of their income, whilst the more expensive pieces such as haute couture, high jewellery, hand-bags, shoes and even furnishings are usually reserved for the wealthier upper-class clientele.\n\nA lot of big designer labels focus on haute couture and marketing while licensing the production of their cheaper merchandise to others. In the eyewear industry for example brands like Burberry, Chanel, Armani and Prada license their brand names to market leaders like Luxottica.\n\nMany department stores themselves may be considered designer labels, such as Neiman Marcus, Harrods, David Jones and Daimaru.\n\nDesigner labels are not only restricted to the fashion design industry. Many car and motorcycle companies such as Rolls Royce, Harley Davidson and Mercedes Benz are regarded as designer labels.

It is designed for lounging in comfort, with a deeper, wider seat than that of a regular \"fauteuil\", though the \"bergères\" by Bellangé in the White House (\"one illustrated\") are more formal.

The Quartet has achieved widespread recognition, having given recitals in leading British concert halls and at music festivals in Britain and across Europe. They have also won several major prizes in string quartet and chamber music competitions. The Quartet is named for the outstanding twentieth-century Italian violin maker and restorer Simone Sacconi, whose book \"The Secrets of Stradivari\" is considered an indispensable reference for violin makers.\n\nThe quartet retains its founding members, who are:\n\nSince its formation at the Royal College of Music in 2001, the Sacconi Quartet has established a secure and substantial reputation. The Quartet is recognised for its unanimous and compelling ensemble, performing with style and commitment and consistently communicating with a fresh and imaginative approach. Its four founder members demonstrate a shared passion for string quartet repertoire, infectiously reaching out to audiences with their energy and enthusiasm. The Quartet have enjoyed a highly successful international career, performing regularly throughout Europe, at London's major venues, in recordings and radio broadcasts. The Sacconi is \"Quartet in Association\" at the Royal College of Music and \"Associate Artist\" at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre.\nThe Sacconi Quartet is renowned for its vigorous and individual approach to music-making. In 2008, the Quartet held the inaugural Sacconi Chamber Music Festival in Folkestone, Kent. Now in its fifth year, the festival is an established event in the cultural calendar and is expanding year on year with challenging programming and exciting collaborations. The Sacconi Quartet has performed at all the major London venues including Wigmore Hall, Kings Place, Cadogan Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room and Conway Hall. They have travelled extensively throughout the rest of the UK and Europe to venues including Bridgewater Hall in Manchester, Musikverein in Vienna, Muziekgebouw in Amsterdam, L'Auditori in Barcelona and Auditorio Nacional de Música in Madrid as well as many venues in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Finland, Norway and the Czech Republic. In 2008 the Sacconi made their debut at the Liceo de Cámara Madrid, and in 2009 at the Concerts du Midi, Brussels and the Festspiele Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany. The Quartet also made their first visit to the Middle East in 2009, where they were invited by the British Council to give concerts and workshops in Jordan's capital city, Amman.\n\nHighlights of the 2014/15 season include collaborations with Miloš Karadaglić, Ksenija Sidorova and the Vertavo Quartet as well as performances in Switzerland, Spain and across the UK, including returning to the Wigmore Hall. Highlights of recent seasons include collaborations with Pekka Kuusisto, Freddy Kempf, Mark Simpson and Lavinia Meijer, performances in Germany, Spain, Holland, the Quartet's debut in Italy and the completion of their second major project at Kings Place, performing the great piano quintets over two years with pianist Simon Crawford-Phillips. The Sacconi performed their 10th birthday celebratory concert at Kings Place to a sold-out hall.\n\nIn Summer 2015 the quartet embarked on an exciting new immersive project called HEARTFELT. A radical reinterpretation of Beethoven's iconic String Quartet in A minor opus 132, HEARTFELT pushed the boundaries of chamber music through combining sound, light and touch, for a truly unique performance in which audience members connected with each performer's heartbeat through holding robotic ‘hearts’. Developed in a unique collaboration with robotics and lighting designers and funded by Arts Council England, HEARTFELT received 4-star reviews from The Guardian and The Independent, and was described by the latter as “a powerful way to experience the visceral physicality of Beethoven’s profound thanksgiving”. www.heartfelt.org.uk\n\nTo date the Quartet has given twenty world premières and three British premières, including quartets by György Kurtág, Robin Holloway, Paul Patterson, Timothy Salter, John Metcalf and Alun Hoddinott, and recently they performed as the solo string quartet on Paul McCartney's new song \"Come Home\". The Sacconi Quartet has been joined on stage by many artists including Mark Padmore, Melvyn Tan, Andrew Marriner, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Guy Johnston, Alasdair Beatson, Tom Poster, Matthew Rose, Bellowhead’s Jon Boden and actor Timothy West.\n\nFirm believers in the importance of bringing chamber music to the next generation, the Sacconi Quartet dedicates much passion, time and energy to education work. They regularly lead workshops and give schools and family concerts as part of the Sacconi Chamber Music Festival outreach programme and the CAVATINA Chamber Music Trust. Their latest project, an educational show entitled The String Thing, with script by Matthew Sharp, has gone down a storm wherever it is performed.\n\n\nThe Sacconi Quartet has its own, highly successful, record label. Sacconi Records is expanding by one or two releases each year. In 2011 a disc of Czech quartets was released which has received widespread critical acclaim and was tipped as a classical chart 'Hot Shot' by Classic FM. Their debut recording of Haydn's opus 54 quartets was praised in the press and both the Ravel and Haydn discs were featured in The Full Works programme on Classic FM. Their 2006 recording of Finzi's song cycle \"By Footpath and Stile\" with baritone Roderick Williams for Naxos was well received in all the national broadsheets and BBC Music Magazine.\n\n", "id": "7715672", "categories": ["Musical groups established in 2001", "English string quartets"], "title": "Sacconi Quartet"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715705", "text": "Adolf Hitler's directives\n\nAdolf Hitler made many hundreds of directives, orders and decrees while Führer of Nazi Germany, many of them related to military policy, and the treatment of civilians in occupied countries. Many of them are direct evidence of the commission of war crimes such as the notorious Commando Order. Other orders provide evidence of crimes against humanity, such as the Hitler order establishing forced euthanasia of disabled people in 1939 under Action T4, and the Nacht und Nebel order for eliminating civilian resisters in occupied countries.\n\nOn 21 October 1938, Hitler issued a new directive to the Wehrmacht to prepare for the \"following eventualities\":\n\n\nIn 1939 Hitler issued an order which became the justification for killing disabled children and people in Action T4. It laid the basis for the Holocaust since gassing was a favoured method of murdering the many victims. The SS staff who operated the gas chambers were later employed at Auschwitz and many other concentration camps and death camps.\n\nOn 3 April 1939, the directive for \"Fall Weiss\" (Case White) was ready. It was issued on 11 April.\n\nThe first section, written by Hitler, began:\n\n\"German relations with Poland continue to be based on the principles of avoiding any disturbances. Should Poland, however, change her policy towards Germany, a final settlement might become necessary in spite of the Treaty in force with Poland. The aim then will be to destroy Polish military strength, and create in the East a situation which satisfies the requirements of National Defence. The free state of Danzig will be proclaimed a part of Reich territory by the outbreak of hostilities at the latest. The political leaders consider it their task in this case to isolate Poland if possible, that is to say, to limit the war to Poland only.\"\n\nThe Wehrmacht had to be ready to carry out \"Fall Weiss\" at any time after 1 September 1939.\n\nThe notorious Commissar Order (\"Kommissarbefehl\"), dated 6 June 1941, followed directly on the Barbarossa decree. It was called \"Instructions on the Treatment of Political Commissars\" and began:\n\nIn the struggle against Bolshevism, we must \"not\" assume that the enemy's conduct will be based on principles of humanity or of international law. In particular, hate-inspired, cruel and inhumane treatment of prisoners can be expected on the part of \"all grades of political commissars\", who are the real leaders of resistance...To show consideration to these elements during this struggle, or to act in accordance with international rules of war, is wrong and endangers both our own security and the rapid pacification of conquered territory...Political commissars have initiated barbaric, Asiatic methods of warfare. Consequently, they will be dealt with \"immediately\" and with maximum severity. As a matter of principle, they will be shot at once, whether captured during operations or otherwise showing resistance.\n\nNacht und Nebel (\"Night and Fog\") was a directive () of Adolf Hitler on 7 December 1941 that was originally intended to remove all political activists and resistance 'helpers', \"anyone endangering German security\" (\"die deutsche Sicherheit gefährden\") throughout Nazi Germany's occupied territories. The name was a direct reference to a magic spell involving the \"\"Tarnhelm\"\" (\"stealth helmet\") from Wagner's \"Rheingold\". The Tarnhelm could make its wearer invisible and instantly transport him to another location.\n\nIn February 1942, two months later, Armed Forces High Command Feldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel expanded it to include all persons in occupied countries who had been taken into custody and were still alive eight days later. The decree was meant to intimidate local populations into submission by denying friends and families of the missing any knowledge of their whereabouts or their fate. The prisoners were secretly transported to Germany, apparently vanishing without a trace, but in fact incarcerated in concentration camps.\n\nFührer Directive No. 46 was issued on 18 August 1942 under the title \"Instructions For Intensified Action Against Banditry [\"Bandenbekämpfung\"] In The East\", marking the radicalisation of so-called anti-partisan warfare. The directive called on the security forces to act with \"utter brutality\" to achieve \"complete extermination\" of \"gangs\", while providing immunity from prosecution for any acts committed during \"bandit-fighting\" operations.\n\nThe directive designated the SS as the organisation responsible for rear-area warfare in areas under civilian administration. In areas under military jurisdiction (the Army Group Rear Areas), the Army High Command had the overall responsibility. The directive declared the entire population of \"bandit\" (i.e. partisan-controlled) territories as enemy combatants. In practice, this meant that the aims of security warfare was not pacification, but complete destruction and depopulation of \"bandit\" and \"bandit-threatened\" territories, turning them into \"dead zones\" (\"Tote Zonen\").\n\nThe Kommandobefehl (\"Commando Order\") was issued by Adolf Hitler on 18 October 1942 stating that all Allied commandos encountered by German forces in Europe and Africa should be killed immediately without trial, even in proper uniforms or if they attempted to surrender. Any commando or small group of commandos or a similar unit, agents, and saboteurs not in proper uniforms, who fell into the hands of the German military forces by some means other than direct combat (through the police in occupied territories, for instance) were to be handed over immediately to the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Security Service). The order, which was issued in secret, made it clear that failure to carry out these orders by any commander or officer would be considered to be an act of negligence punishable under German military law.\n\nThe Nero Decree was issued by Adolf Hitler on 19 March 1945, ordering the destruction of German infrastructure to prevent their use by Allied forces as they penetrated deep within Germany. It was officially titled \"Demolitions on Reich Territory Decree\" (\"Befehl betreffend Zerstörungsmaßnahmen im Reichsgebiet\") and has subsequently become known as the Nero Decree, after the Roman Emperor Nero, who supposedly engineered the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. It was countermanded by among others, Albert Speer, who wanted to preserve as much as possible for Germany following her defeat in 1945.\n\n\n", "id": "7715705", "categories": [], "title": "Adolf Hitler's directives"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715707", "text": "Ilag\n\nIlag is an abbreviation of the German word \"Internierungslager\". They were internment camps established by the German Army in World War II to hold Allied civilians, caught in areas that were occupied by the German Army. They included United States citizens caught in Europe by surprise when war was declared in December 1941 and citizens of the British Commonwealth caught in areas engulfed by the Blitzkrieg.\n\nAmongst the internees were British born citizens who were resident in the Channel Islands. In October 1941, Adolf Hitler ordered the internment of 8,000 British, in retaliation for the internment by the British Army of 800 Germans living in Iran. The order was not carried out until it was reissued by Hitler in September 1942. The German commander of the islands, based in Jersey, was ordered to deport to camps in Germany all British citizens not born in the islands. The numbers were reduced, with around 2,200 men, women and children being deported.\n\n\n\nThere were 219 internment camps in France during the Second World War. Several Ilags were set up in France by the German Army to hold citizens of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth countries that were caught by the rapid advance during the Battle of France. The main camps were:\n\nThe camp at Besançon was called \"Frontstalag 142\", or \"Caserne Vauban\". At the end of 1940, 2,400 women, mostly British, were interned in the Vauban barracks and another 500 old and sick in the St. Jacques hospital close by. In early 1941 many of them were released; the rest were transferred to Vittel.\n\nThe camp was located in the old barracks built in the middle of the 19th century at Saint-Denis, close to Paris. The camp was opened June 1940 and existed until liberated by the United States Army in August 1944. Part of the grounds were surrounded by barbed wire to provide open space for exercise.\nIn early 1942, there were more than 1,000 male British internees in the camp. The meagre food rations were augmented by the International Red Cross packages, so that, overall, their diet was satisfactory. Life was tolerable because there was a good library and recreation was provided by sports activities and theatre.\n\nAlso called \"Frontstalag 121\", this was one of the more hospitable internment camps as it was located in requisitioned hotels in this spa near Epinal in the Department Vosges. Most of the British families and single women were transferred here from St. Denis and Besançon.\n\nIn early 1942, women over 60, men over 75 and children under 16 were released. The overall population was thus reduced to about 2,400. The inmates included a number of American families and women.\nProvisions for recreation included a local theatre and a park with seven tennis courts.\n\nA young New Zealander and two British women escaped in August 1941 and made their way to England.\n\n\nA camp in , close to Meckenbeuren in Württemberg, on Lake Constance was opened in 1940 and operated until 1945. It was situated in a castle and four adjacent buildings. Originally it had been a mental hospital run by nuns. By orders of Hitler, about 700 of the patients were exterminated with injections, to provide room for internees.\n\nThe first internees were about 300 British citizens from Poland. More British were brought in 1941 from Belgium, Greece, Netherlands and other countries. The food rations were augmented with Red Cross packages. The guards were older German veterans of World War I and treated the internees well, as several of them had been prisoners of war in British camps and had been treated well. In January 1943 many of the married women were transferred to Vittel (see above).\n\nBuilt in 1939 as barracks, this camp became an Ilag to accommodate Channel Island families and was located on a plateau northwest of Biberach an der Riß in southeastern Baden-Württemberg. It consisted of 23 concrete huts which had previously served as Oflag V-B for officers who were prisoner of war. Initially, the camp was administered by the German Army, but in spring of 1943, the administration was transferred to the Interior Ministry; this caused a worsening of food rations. Otherwise, the International Red Cross considered conditions in the camp satisfactory. \n\nIn January 1943, the camp held 1,011 internees: 429 men, 437 women, and 145 children.\n\n20 Channel Island civilians died in Biberach.\n\nThis camp also held Channel Island families. It was located in the town of Bad Wurzach and southeastern Baden-Württemberg. Earlier, it had been used as an oflag housing French officers. Conditions were less satisfactory because it was located in a three-story 18th-century castle, that had recently been a monastery, and the rooms were dark and damp. 618 internees arrived at the end of October 1942, all of them families. In late 1944 72 Dutch Jews arrived from Bergen-Belsen, most appeared to have English grandparents. The deportees now learned first hand about conditions elsewhere.\n\n12 Channel Island civilians died in Wurzach.\n\nBritish and American citizens were interned in Laufen and Tittmoning in Bavaria, on the border with Austria. In September 1942, British single men from the Channel Islands were sent here where they found some Americans in residence. In 1943, the younger men, over 16 who had parents in Biberach or Wurzach were moved to Laufen to release space. These two camps were always administered by the German Army.\n\nFrank Stroobant, the camp senior, was invited in April 1943 to attend an inspection in the forest of Katyn in Russia where a massacre of 22,000, mainly Polish army and police officers, by Soviet forces had been uncovered. He was the only civilian witness at the event From June 1943 the camp senior became Ambrose Sherwill.\n\nBoredom was a major problem, some internees were permitted to undertake paid work outside camp. The moral view of whether work should be done was strongly debated in the camp, but as everyone was an individual, it was up to each person to make their own decision.\n\nIn April 1944, Laufen held 459 British internees (417 Channel Islanders) and 120 Americans, including Josef Nassy. 10 Channel Island internees died in Laufen during internment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7715707", "categories": ["World War II internment camps in Germany"], "title": "Ilag"}

The album was recorded live in Toronto at Sound Stage Studios by Tom Treumuth and technical producer Jack Richardson, using a two-track digital recorder called \"Soundstream\" brought in for the purpose. This was the second digitally-recorded album ever produced and a first in Canada, and was recorded in three days with no overdubs The music contained elements of progressive rock and jazz rock. The band members at that time were guitarist Tony Cook, drummer Brian Bolliger, Steve McKenna on bass and slide guitar, singer Bruce Cumming and keyboardist Tom Treumuth. Ian Thomas and Marek Norman musicians contributed backup vocals, Matt McKenna added some guitar and organ work, and Erik Cadeski's percussion and wind-up fish in a tank can also be heard.\n\nNot long after that, Treumuth and Gary Furniss formed their own independent label, Hypnotic.

The population at the 2011 census was measured at 473. Its unusual name, \"ambo\" being the Latin for \"both\", originates from the merging of two originally separate villages called Wenden Magna (or Great Wenden) and Wenden Parva (or Little Wenden).\n\nWendens Ambo is approximately two miles south-west of the market town of Saffron Walden, fifteen miles south of Cambridge and forty miles north of London.\n\nWithin the village is Audley End railway station which is the main station for Audley End House and Saffron Walden.\n\nThe earliest signs of settlement are from the Roman period. Remains of a villa were found during an excavation in 1853, and finds of flint tools from 300–200 BC suggest an even earlier settlement.\n\nIt is likely that the farming community of Wenden probably started around the 6th and 7th centuries, taking its name from the valley in which it lies: Wendene. The Domesday Book contains the first written account of Wenden Magna and Wenden Parva. Wenden Magna was owned by Robert Gernon, a Frenchman who also had land in Stansted and Takeley. Wenden Parva was also owned by a Frenchman, William de Warenne. The Wendens passed through the Middle Ages as very ordinary English villages, with their parish church of St Mary the Virgin located in Wenden Magna. A third Wenden, higher up the valley to the west is Wenden Lofts (probably the \"Loutes Wenden\" mentioned in a legal record of 1470, where the nearby villages of \"Arkysden\" & \"Elmedon\" are also mentioned.)\n\nDuring the 17th century work began to rebuild the village dwellings, some of which are still occupied today. Also at this time, on 23 March 1662, Wenden Magna and Wenden Parva were joined to create Wendens Ambo.\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries brought the Industrial Revolution and also the railway, providing opportunities for work elsewhere, leading to Wenden eventually becoming a commuter village.\n\nThe Hundred Parishes\n\n", "id": "7715867", "categories": ["Villages in Essex"], "title": "Wendens Ambo"}

Due to the terms of its license, the signal was limited to the confines of the Florida State campus. It was on the air for three hours every night during the week, with a lineup of campus news, interviews, music and an occasional play.\n\nThe station was forced off the air in April 1953 due to complaints that the signal was leaking off campus. Florida State applied for a low-powered FM license, and WFSU returned to the air at 91.5 FM in July 1954. Soon afterward, it joined the National Association of Educational Broadcasters, allowing it to significantly upgrade its programming with offerings from BBC World Service and Radio France. It also began carrying Seminoles football games after no commercial station would carry them.\n\nIn 1970, WFSU-FM became a charter member of NPR, and was one of the 90 stations to carry the initial broadcast of \"All Things Considered.\" In the 1970s, it shifted to a format of mostly classical music.\n\nThe station continued to grow during the 1980s, but was somewhat hampered by problems with its signal. Unlike most NPR stations of the time, it had no backup power source for its transmitter, resulting in frequent outages. The station's reception was also marginal at best in the northeastern part of the city, which is very hilly. To solve the problem, WFSU won approval for a new station on 88.9 FM, operating from a new tower northeast of Tallahassee. All NPR news and information programming moved there on October 14, 1990. Classical music remained on 91.5, which received new call letters, WFSQ. However, due to the legal structure of the changeover, the Federal Communications Commission considers WFSQ to be the same station as the old WFSU. To improve its coverage on the Georgia side of the market, Florida State signed on WFSL in 2003.\n\nWFSW signed on in 1996, providing Panama City with a second NPR service, alongside Gulf Coast Community College's WKGC-FM. Until WKGC dropped NPR in 2013, Panama City was one of the smallest cities in the country with separate NPR stations.\n\nIn June 2011, it was revealed that WFSU will receive $2.8 million in funding for various services related to Florida government. This is despite the $4.8 million of funding to other public radio and television stations vetoed by Governor Rick Scott in May 2011.\n\n\n", "id": "7715888", "categories": ["Classical music radio stations in the United States", "Florida State University", "NPR member stations", "Radio stations established in 1949", "Radio stations in Tallahassee, Florida", "1949 establishments in Florida", "NPR member networks"], "title": "WFSU-FM"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715915", "text": "Social cognitive theory\n\nSocial cognitive theory (SCT), used in psychology, education, and communication, holds that portions of an individual's knowledge acquisition can be directly related to observing others within the context of social interactions, experiences, and outside media influences. This theory was advanced by Albert Bandura as an extension of his social learning theory. The theory states that when people observe a model performing a behavior and the consequences of that behavior, they remember the sequence of events and use this information to guide subsequent behaviors. Observing a model can also prompt the viewer to engage in behavior they already learned. In other words, people do not learn new behaviors solely by trying them and either succeeding or failing, but rather, the survival of humanity is dependent upon the replication of the actions of others. Depending on whether people are rewarded or punished for their behavior and the outcome of the behavior, the observer may choose to replicate behavior modeled. Media provides models for a vast array of people in many different environmental settings.\n\nThe conceptual roots for social cognitive theory come from Edwin B. Holt and Harold Chapman Brown's 1931 book theorizing that all animal action is based on fulfilling the psychological needs of \"feeling, emotion, and desire\". The most notable component of this theory is that it predicted a person cannot learn to imitate until they are imitated.\n\nIn 1941, Neal E. Miller and John Dollard presented their book with a revision of Holt's social learning and imitation theory. They argued four factors contribute to learning: drives, cues, responses, and rewards. One driver is social motivation, which includes imitativeness, the process of matching an act to an appropriate cue of where and when to perform the act. A behavior is imitated depending on whether the model receives a positive or negative response consequences. Miller and Dollard argued that if one were motivated to learn a particular behavior, then that particular behavior would be learned through clear observations. By imitating these observed actions the individual observer would solidify that learned action and would be rewarded with positive reinforcement.\n\nThe proposition of social learning was expanded upon and theorized by Canadian psychologist Albert Bandura. Bandura, along with his students and colleagues conducted a series of studies, known as the Bobo doll experiment, in 1961 and 1963 to find out why and when children display aggressive behaviors. These studies demonstrated the value of modeling for acquiring novel behaviors. These studies helped Bandura publish his seminal article and book in 1977 that expanded on the idea of how behavior is acquired, and thus built from Miller and Dollard's research. In Bandura's 1977 article, he claimed that Social Learning Theory shows a direct correlation between a person's perceived self-efficacy and behavioral change. Self-efficacy comes from four sources: \"performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states\".\n\nIn 1986, Bandura published his second book, which expanded and renamed his original theory. He called the new theory \"social cognitive theory\". Bandura changed the name to emphasize the major role cognition plays in encoding and performing behaviors. In this book, Bandura argued that human behavior is caused by personal, behavioral, and environmental influences.\n\nIn 2001, Bandura brought SCT to mass communication in his journal article that stated the theory could be used to analyze how \"symbolic communication influences human thought, affect and action\". The theory shows how new behavior diffuses through society by psychosocial factors governing acquisition and adoption of the behavior.\n\nIn 2011, Bandura published a book chapter -- \"The Social and Policy Impact of Social Cognitive Theory\"—to extend SCT'S application in health promotion and urgent global issues, which provides insight into addressing global problems through a macro social lens, aiming at improving equality of individuals' lives under the umbrellas of SCT.\n\nSCT has been applied to many areas of human functioning such as career choice and organizational behavior as well as in understanding classroom motivation, learning, and achievement.\n\nSocial Cognitive Theory originated in psychology, but based on an unofficial November 2013 Google Scholar search, only 2 percent of articles published on SCT are in the pure psychology field. About 20 percent of articles are from Education and 16 percent from Business. The majority of publications using SCT, 56 percent, come from the field of Applied Health Psychology. The majority of current research in Health Psychology focuses on testing SCT in behavioral change campaigns as opposed to expanding on the theory. Campaign topics include: increasing fruit and vegetable intake, increasing physical activity, HIV education, and breastfeeding.\n\nBorn in 1925, Bandura is still influencing the world with expansions of SCT. His recent work, published May 2011, focuses on how SCT impacts areas of both health and population in relation to climate change. He proposes that these problems could be solved through television serial dramas that show models similar to viewers performing the desired behavior. On health, Bandura writes that currently there is little incentive for doctors to write prescriptions for healthy behavior, but he believes the cost of fixing health problems start to outweigh the benefits of being healthy. Bandura argues that we are on the cusp of moving from a disease model (focusing on people with problems) to a health model (focusing on people being healthy) and SCT is the theory that should be used to further a healthy society. Specifically on Population, Bandura states that population growth is a global crisis because of its correlation with depletion and degradation of our planet's resources. Bandura argues that SCT should be used to increase birth control use, reduce gender inequality through education, and to model environmental conservation to improve the state of the planet.\n\nSocial cognitive theory is a learning theory based on the idea that people learn by observing others. These learned behaviors can be central to one's personality. While social psychologists agree that the environment one grows up in contributes to behavior, the individual person (and therefore cognition) is just as important. People learn by observing others, with the environment, behavior, and cognition acting as primary factors that influence development in a reciprocal triadic relationship. Each behavior witnessed can change a person's way of thinking (cognition). Similarly, the environment one is raised in may influence later behaviors. For example, a caregiver's mindset (also cognition) determines the environment in which their children are raised.\n\nThe core concepts of this theory are explained by Bandura through a schematization of triadic reciprocal causation, The schema shows how the reproduction of an observed behavior is influenced by the interaction of the following three determinants: \n\nIt is important to note that learning can occur without a change in behavior. According to J.E. Ormrod's general principles of social learning, while a visible change in behavior is the most common proof of learning, it is not absolutely necessary. Social learning theorists believe that because people can learn through observation alone, their learning may not necessarily be shown in their performance. These are interdependent on each other and its influence can be directly linked with individual or group psychological behavior. According to Alex Stajkovic and Fred Luthans it is critically important to recognize that the relative influences exerted by one, two, or three interacting factors on motivated behavior will vary depending on different activities, different individuals and different circumstances.\n\nSocial cognitive theory is proposed in an agentic perspective, which suggests that, instead of being just shaped by environments or inner forces, individuals are self-developing, self-regulating, self-reflecting and proactive. Specifically, human agency operates within three modes:\n\nHuman agency has four core properties:\n\n\nEvolving over time, human beings are featured with advanced neural systems, which enable individuals to acquire knowledge and skills by both direct and symbolic terms. Four primary capabilities are addressed as important foundations of social cognitive theory: symbolizing capability, self-regulation capability, self-reflective capability, and vicarious capability.\n\n\nSocial cognitive theory revolves around the process of knowledge acquisition or learning directly correlated to the observation of models. The models can be those of an interpersonal imitation or media sources. Effective modeling teaches general rules and strategies for dealing with different situations.\n\nTo illustrate that people learn from watching others, Albert Bandura and his colleagues constructed a series of experiments using a Bobo doll. In the first experiment, children were exposed to either an aggressive or non-aggressive model of either the same sex or opposite sex as the child. There was also a control group. The aggressive models played with the Bobo doll in an aggressive manner, while the non-aggressive models played with other toys. They found that children who were exposed to the aggressive models performed more aggressive actions toward the Bobo doll afterward, and that boys were more likely to do so than girls.\n\nFollowing that study, Albert Bandura tested whether the same was true for models presented through media by constructing an experiment he called \"Bobo Doll Behavior: A Study of Aggression\". In this experiment Bandura exposed a group of children to a video featuring violent and aggressive actions. After the video he then placed the children in a room with a Bobo doll to see how they behaved with it. Through this experiment, Bandura discovered that children who had watched the violent video subjected the dolls to more aggressive and violent behavior, while children not exposed to the video did not. This experiment displays the social cognitive theory because it depicts how people reenact behaviors they see in the media. In this case, the children in this experiment reenacted the model of violence they directly learned from the video.\n\nObservations should include: \n\nModeling does not limit to only live demonstrations but also verbal and written behaviour can act as indirect forms of modeling. Modeling not only allows students to learn behaviour that they should repeat but also to inhibit certain behaviours. For instance, if a teacher glares at one student who is talking out of turn, other students may suppress this behavior to avoid a similar reaction. Teachers model both material objectives and underlying curriculum of virtuous living. Teachers should also be dedicated to the building of high self-efficacy levels in their students by recognizing their accomplishments.\n\nTo learn a particular behavior, people must understand what the potential outcome is if they repeat that behavior. The observer does not expect the actual rewards or punishments incurred by the model, but anticipates similar outcomes when imitating the behavior (called \"outcome expectancies\"), which is why modeling impacts cognition and behavior. These expectancies are heavily influenced by the environment that the observer grows up in; for example, the expected consequences for a DUI in the United States of America are a fine, with possible jail time, whereas the same charge in another country might lead to the infliction of the death penalty.\n\nFor example, in the case of a student, the instructions the teacher provides help students see what outcome a particular behaviour leads to. It is the duty of the teacher to teach a student that when a behaviour is successfully learned, the outcomes are meaningful and valuable to the students.\n\nSocial cognitive theory posits that learning most likely occurs if there is a close identification between the observer and the model and if the observer also has a good deal of self-efficacy. Self–efficacy is the extent to which an individual believes that they can master a particular skill. Self-efficacy beliefs function as an important set of proximal determinants of human motivation, affect, and action—which operate on action through motivational, cognitive, and affective intervening processes.\n\nAccording to Bandura, self-efficacy is \"the belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations\". Bandura and other researchers have found an individual's self-efficacy plays a major role in how goals, tasks, and challenges are approached. Individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to believe they can master challenging problems and they can recover quickly from setbacks and disappointments. Individuals with low self-efficacy tend to be less confident and don't believe they can perform well, which leads them to avoid challenging tasks. Therefore, self-efficacy plays a central role in behavior performance. Observers who have high level of self-efficacy are more likely to adopt observational learning behaviors.\n\nSelf-efficacy can be developed or increased by: \n\nFor example, students become more effortful, active, pay attention, highly motivated and better learners when they perceive that they have mastered a particular task. It is the duty of the teacher to allow student to perceive in their efficacy by providing feedback to understand their level of proficiency. Teachers should ensure that the students have the knowledge and strategies they need to complete the tasks.\n\nSelf-efficacy has also been used to predict behavior in various health related situations such as weight loss, quitting smoking, and recovery from heart attack. In relation to exercise science, self-efficacy has produced some of the most consistent results revealing an increase in participation in exercise.\n\nIdentification allows the observer to feel a one-to-one similarity with the model, and can thus lead to a higher chance of the observer following through with the modeled action. People are more likely to follow behaviors modeled by someone with whom they can identify with. The more commonalities or emotional attachments perceived between the observer and the model, the more likely the observer learns and reenact the modeled behavior.\n\nSocial cognitive theory is often applied as a theoretical framework of studies pertained to media representation regarding race, gender, age and beyond. Social cognitive theory suggested heavily repeated images presented in mass media can be potentially processed and encoded by the viewers (Bandura, 2011). Media content analytic studies examine the substratum of media messages that viewers are exposed to, which could provide an opportunity to uncover the social values attached to these media representations. Although media contents studies cannot directly test the cognitive process, findings can offer an avenue to predict potential media effects from modeling certain contents, which provides evidence and guidelines for designing subsequent empirical work.\n\nSocial cognitive theory is pervasively employed in studies examining attitude or behavior changes triggered by the mass media. As Bandura suggested, people can learn how to perform behaviors through media modeling. SCT has been widely applied in media studies pertained to sports, health, education and beyond. For instance, Hardin and Greer in 2009 examined the gender-typing of sports within the theoretical framework of social cognitive theory, suggesting that sports media consumption and gender-role socialization significantly related with gender perception of sports in American college students.\n\nIn health communication, social cognitive theory has been applied in research related to smoking cessation, HIV prevention, safe sex behaviors, and so on. For example, Martino, Collins, Kanouse, Elliott, and Berry in 2005 examined the relationship between the exposure to television’s sexual content and adolescents’ sexual behavior through the lens of social cognitive theory, confirming the significant relationship between the two variables among white and African American groups; however, no significant correlation was found between the two variables in the ethic group of Hispanics, indicating that peer norm could possibly serve as a mediator of the two examined variables.\n\nMiller's 2005 study found that choosing the proper gender, age, and ethnicity for models ensured the success of an AIDS campaign to inner city teenagers. This occurred because participants could identify with a recognizable peer, have a greater sense of self-efficacy, and then imitate the actions to learn the proper preventions and actions.\nA study by Azza Ahmed in 2009 looked to see if there would be an increase in breastfeeding by mothers of preterm infants when exposed to a breastfeeding educational program guided by SCT. Sixty mothers were randomly assigned to either participate in the program or they were given routine care. The program consisted of SCT strategies that touched on all three SCT determinants: personal – showing models performing breastfeeding correctly to improve self-efficacy, behavioral –weekly check-ins for three months reinforced participants' skills, environmental – mothers were given an observational checklist to make sure they successfully completed the behavior. The author found that mothers exposed to the program showed significant improvement in their breastfeeding skills, were more likely to exclusively breastfeed, and had fewer problems then the mothers who were not exposed to the educational program.\n\nSocial cognitive theory emphasizes a large difference between an individual's ability to be morally competent and morally performing. Moral competence involves having the ability to perform a moral behavior, whereas moral performance indicates actually following one's idea of moral behavior in a specific situation. Moral competencies include:\n\nAs far as an individual's development is concerned, moral competence is the growth of cognitive-sensory processes; simply put, being aware of what is considered right and wrong. By comparison, moral performance is influenced by the possible rewards and incentives to act a certain way. For example, a person's moral competence might tell them that stealing is wrong and frowned upon by society; however, if the reward for stealing is a substantial sum, their moral performance might indicate a different line of thought. Therein lies the core of social cognitive theory.\n\nFor the most part, social cognitive theory remains the same for various cultures. Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures (as crimes like murder, theft, and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society), there is not much room for people to have different views on what is morally right or wrong. The main reason that social cognitive theory applies to all nations is because it does not say what is moral and immoral; it simply states that we can acknowledge these two concepts. Our actions in real-life scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating our morals is significant enough, and nothing else.\n\nIn series TV programming, according to social cognitive theory, the awarded behaviors of liked characters are supposed to be followed by viewers, while punished behaviors are supposed to be avoided by media consumers. However, in most cases, protagonists in TV shows are less likely to experience the long-term suffering and negative consequences caused by their risky behaviors, which could potentially undermine the punishments conveyed by the media, leading to a modeling of the risky behaviors. Nabi and Clark conducted experiments about individual’s attitudes and intentions consuming various portrayals of one-night stand sex– unsafe and risky sexual behavior, finding that individuals who had not previously experience one night stand sex, consuming media portrayals of this behavior could significantly increase their expectations of having an one night stand sex in the future, although negative outcomes were represented in TV shows.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7715915", "categories": [], "title": "Social cognitive theory"}

They released two studio albums and were signed to RCA Records. \n\nPapa Vegas was founded in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where vocalist Joel Ferguson and guitarist Pete Dunning first began playing together. Dunning and Ferguson collaborated for three years before parting ways for individual projects, and Ferguson played under the name \"Papa Vegas\" with a variety of other musicians. After playing with Papa Vegas at a battle of the bands competition, they were heard by Brian Vander Ark, then lead singer of The Verve Pipe, who signed them to his Sid Flips label and produced their debut EP, \"Grounded\", with Pete Dunning back on lead guitar, Scott Stefanski on drums, and original bassist Mick Force. Sid Flips was folded into RCA, and the group was set up with Don Gilmore to produce their debut full-length album. Tom Lord-Alge mixed; the result was released as \"Hello Vertigo\" in April 1999. All songs on the album were written by Joel Ferguson with the exception of \"Sermon Underground\", which was co-written by Joel Ferguson and Pete Dunning. Their biggest hit single was \"Bombshell\", which peaked at #20 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1999. Following the album's release, they toured with the Verve Pipe and also Kent, a critically acclaimed band from Stockholm then touring the US under RCA's European label, and had a lesser hit with the release of \"Something Wrong\" but the full-length did not sell as well as hoped, and no further hit singles followed. The group was dropped from the RCA label in March 2000 and split up shortly afterward. In December 2004, the band reunited to play a large venue show with The Verve Pipe. The show was a success, and they repeated it in December 2005. Ferguson, Stefanski and Dunning re-grouped for various projects on and off in the years that followed, most notably Miles to Mars. Pete Dunning went on to play in the Grand Rapids groups Molly, White Rabbit And Barrel Bones while Scott Stefanski and Joel Ferguson played in The Verve Pipe. In January 2009 Papa Vegas re-grouped as a five piece with John Connors replacing Force on bass, and adding Randy Tate on keyboards. The band is currently playing shows in their home state of Michigan and is working on a forthcoming album to be released in early 2010 on their own Shiver Music label.\n\n<br>\n", "id": "7715917", "categories": ["Musical groups disestablished in 2000", "American post-grunge musical groups", "Alternative rock groups from Michigan"], "title": "Papa Vegas"}

He moved to Napoli in 1978, where he played two seasons. He then played for Udinese from 1980 to 1985, and then for some lower league teams, including Perugia and Catania. He was also capped for the Italian U-21 side.\n\nAfter his retirement, Tesser began a coaching career in 1992 for Serie D side Sevegliano, and successively became a coach at the youth level for Udinese and Venezia. His first professional coaching job came in 2001, for Serie C2 side F.C. Südtirol. In 2003, he replaced Ezio Rossi at the helm of U.S. Triestina Calcio of Serie B. After a very good season, followed by a poorer one, Tesser moved to Cagliari Calcio of Serie A in 2006, but was fired just after the first league match by team chairman Massimo Cellino. In July 2006 he was named coach of Ascoli, replacing Marco Giampaolo. However, after a serie of struggling results ended in a 1–0 home defeat to Empoli F.C. in the 11th matchday, Tesser was fired and replaced by Nedo Sonetti.\n\nTesser started the 2007–08 season at the helm of Serie B side Mantova, with the aim to fight for a promotion spot; however, results did not confirm the initial goals, and he was sacked on 24 February 2008, leaving Mantova in seventh place, seven points far from the fourth playoff spot.\n\nOn January 2009 he accepted a coaching offer from Lega Pro Prima Divisione club Padova; however, his stint with the \"patavini\" lasted only one month, as he was sacked later on February.\n\nOn June 2009 he was named Novara manager. His tenure proved to be highly successful, as he led his club to become Lega Pro Prima Divisione champions in his first season in charge. In the 2010–11 season, Tesser repeated himself as he guided Novara to third place in the final table, then winning a second consecutive promotion to Serie A after defeating Reggina and Padova in the playoffs. The Serie A comeback however proved to be particularly difficult for Novara, who only won 12 points after the first 20 games: this cost Tesser the job, as he was removed from his managerial duties on 30 January 2012 following a 2–0 away loss against Palermo; he was replaced by veteran coach Emiliano Mondonico. On 6 March 2012 he was recalled by Novara as head coach, but on 31 October 2012 he was again sacked.\n\nOn 13 June 2015 Tesser was appointed as the head coach of Avellino, replacing Massimo Rastelli.\n\nIn the summer of 2016 he was hired by the Cremonese.

Commissioned by Nike, New York-based creative lifestyle marketing and public relations agency Cornerstone helped the musical efforts and coordinated the track. The original work was initially available exclusively at Nike Music Store on iTunes. A full-length album re-release with three bonus tracks was issued by DFA Records on CD and vinyl on November 12, 2007. An eight track remix CD entitled \"\" was released September 2009. \"45:33\" was re-released as a limited edition white-label vinyl on May 26, 2015.\n\nThe composition was recorded between July and September 2006 at DFA Studios in New York City. The publicity for \"45:33\" described it as being designed to accompany jogging workouts, \"to reward and push at good intervals of a run.\" An early statement detailed that the composition had been refined after several runs on the treadmill. James Murphy later admitted that this was entirely a lie on his part, and that he does not actually jog. He stated that he wanted to make a long-form record like \"E2-E4\" by Manuel Göttsching and used the opportunity provided by Nike to do so. The artwork of \"45:33\" also resembles that of Göttsching's work.\n\nParts of \"45:33\" were later used on the album \"Sound of Silver\", in particular the track \"Someone Great\", which appears on \"45:33\" as an instrumental section later distinguished as track 3. The complete track was also released for registered Nike+ users in late March 2007 as a gift of appreciation when Nike+ logged its 10 millionth mile. The composition was available to be sold by Nike via iTunes for six months.\n\nAlthough the composition is titled \"45:33\", a reference to the two most common speeds, in RPM, of vinyl records, the actual length is slightly longer.\n\nFor the last series of concerts at Terminal 5 and Madison Square Garden, LCD Soundsystem performed \"45:33\" in full during the second set (Part 3 was saved until the performance of \"Someone Great\"). In the place of Part 3, LCD Soundsystem performed \"Sound of Silver\".\n\nDFA Records announced that \"45:33\" would be re-released on November 12, 2007. It was made available on CD and vinyl through DFA and EMI. The re-release featured three bonus tracks, \"Freak Out/Starry Eyes\", James Murphy and Eric Broucek's dub remix of \"North American Scum\", and \"Hippie Priest Bum-out\", all of which were B-sides from European versions of \"Sound of Silver\" singles. These three tracks would also be made available together separately on the \"Confuse the Marketplace\" EP, released on December 11, 2007.\n\n\"45:33\" received critical acclaim. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 points, the album received an average critic score of 86, based on 25 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Manuel Göttsching was, however, critical of the composition, despite it being inspired by his own work, stating: \"Musically, there is nothing related to \"E2-E4\" – it's just a 'megamix' of his work.\"\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7715973", "categories": ["2006 songs", "LCD Soundsystem songs", "2006 singles", "2006 EPs", "Nike Original Run series", "LCD Soundsystem albums"], "title": "45:33"}

The Type 89B model was the world's first mass-produced diesel engine tank. The tank was armed with a short-barrel 57 mm cannon for knocking out pillboxes and masonry fortifications, and proved effective in campaigns in Manchuria and China, as the Chinese National Revolutionary Army had only three tank battalions to oppose them, which consisted primarily of Vickers export models, German Panzer Is, and Italian CV33 tankettes. The Type 89 was a 1920s design medium tank, built to support the infantry, and thus lacked the armor or armament of 1940s generation Allied armor; it was regarded as obsolete by the time of the 1939 battles of Khalkhin Gol, against the Soviet Union. The code designation \"I-Go\" comes from the \"katakana\" letter [イ] for “first” and the \"kanji\" [号] for \"number\". The designation is also transliterated Chi-Ro and sometimes \"Yi-Go\".\nThe Type 89 evolved from Japan's first domestic tank project initiated by the Imperial Japanese Army's Osaka Technical Arsenal in 1925. The original plan was for two types of tanks to be created. A light tank at 10-ton based on the French Renault FT tank and a 20-ton design modeled after the Vickers Medium tank. By February 1927, the Type 87 Chi-I medium tank was ready for trials. However, it was 20-ton and under-powered. The weight of the initial prototype and its low speed did not impress the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, and a new requirement was issued for a lighter tank, with a nominal weight. The new design was modeled after the Vickers Medium C which had been bought by the Japanese Army in March 1927.\n\nBy April 1928, the new light tank design was finished. The prototype of the was completed in 1929 and designated as the Type 89. Later, the Type 89 was re-classified as a \"medium tank\" because the weight increased to over 10 tons due to several improvements. As the army's Sagami Arsenal lacked the capacity for mass production, a contract was awarded to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which built a new tank factory to specifically produce this model. Production of the Type 89 began in 1931 and it soon became the main battle tank of the Japanese Army.\n\nAlthough the Type 89 was well regarded by the army, there were several small problems to be rectified, notably a gap under the mantlet on early models that allowed rifle fire to enter the turret. Work continued on improving the Type 89 after the production started, and as a result variants were developed.\n\nThe Type 89 required a crew of four (commander/gunner, loader, driver and hull gunner).\n\nThe design of the Type 89 was relatively conventional with a forward-mounted gun turret carrying the main armament, a Type 90 57 mm gun that was complemented by two Type 91 6.5 mm machine guns. One was located in the front hull and the other placed in a turret ball mount pointed towards the rear, a practice followed with most Japanese tanks. The Type 90 57 mm tank gun had a barrel length of (L14.9) el angle of fire of −15 to +20 degrees, AZ angle of fire of 20 degrees, muzzle velocity of , and could penetrate of 20 mm of armor at 500 m (0.8 in/550 yd).\n\nRather than using soft iron armor, as on the earlier Chi-I, the designers chose to use steel plate armor developed by the Nihon Seikosho Company (JSW). The type of armor was referred to as 'Niseko steel', an abbreviation of \"Nihonseikosho\".\n\nThe Type 89 was driven through the rear drive sprocket and featured nine bogies, mounted in pairs on each side, with the forward bogie on an independent suspension. Five smaller return wheels were mounted along a steel girder. The Type A could only communicate with signal flags. Some vehicles were provided with two searchlights for night operations. Later the Type 94 Mk 4 Hei (1934 model) radio communication device with range of 0.6 miles and weight of 198 lb, linked with a radio antenna of in a reverse L shape was installed.\n\n\nThe Type 89 served with Japanese infantry divisions and first saw combat use during the First Battle of Shanghai in 1932. The short-barreled 57 mm gun was effective at destroying machine gun nests and its armor, although thin, was enough to stop small arms fire. The relatively low speed of was not an issue in these types of operations.\n\nThe following year, the Japanese Army formed its first independent armor force by creating three regiments armed with the Type 89, each consisting of two companies with ten tanks each. Three more regiments were formed in 1934. It was deployed for infantry support operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in various campaigns throughout China after 1937. After the out-break of war with China, the peacetime budgetary limitations were removed and the more capable and expensive Mitsubishi \"Chi-Ha\" model was accepted as the new Type 97 medium tank by the army to replace the Type 89. Type 89s were the main medium tank of the Japanese military through 1937.\n\nOn the evening of 2 July 1939, during the battle of Khalkhin Gol, the Japanese Army's 1st Tank Corps, commanded by Lt. General Yasuoka Masaomi, launched an offensive against the Soviet Union's 11th Tank and 7th Armored brigades. The 1st Tank Corps consisted of the 3rd Tank Regiment and 4th Tank Regiment; of which the 3rd regiment consisted of 26 Type 89s, four Type 97 medium tanks, seven Type 94 tankettes, and four Type 97 tankettes, and the 4th regiment contained 35 Type 95s, eight Type 89s, and three Type 94 tankettes respectively. In this battle, the Type 97 medium tank was a newly fielded machine, and was primarily reserved for home units, as well as transitioning into Japanese Army forces stationed in China (Manchuria).\n\nThe 3rd Tank Regiment had, after charging through Soviet artillery barrages, successfully overrun the Soviet motorized infantry and taken the high ground, which had been quickly abandoned by the Soviets. However, by 2100 hours, Soviet counter battery fire had begun pounding the newly taken position, and the 3rd Tank re-positioned themselves behind the objective.\n\nThe 4th Tank Regiment, which had become separated from the 3rd Tank Regiment, advanced upon an objective under the cover of a thunderstorm that masked their movements but exposed the Soviet positions. The 4th Tank Regiment continued to advance, when suddenly a shift in the lightning flashes illuminated the advancing Japanese tanks, whereupon the Soviets immediately opened fire with anti-tank guns, heavy machine guns, and artillery. However, the range was so close that the Soviet artillery could not depress their guns far enough, and the 4th Tank Regiment was ordered to charge at about 0020 hours (12:20 AM). Soviet shells passed wildly over the charging tanks as they penetrated over a thousand yards into the Soviet lines. Now isolated, and deep within the Soviet lines, the 4th Tank Regiment moved several thousands yards where they met up with Japanese infantry.\n\nThe 4th Tank Regiment had expended 1,100 37 mm and 129 57 mm tank shells during the fight, as well as about 16,000 machine gun rounds. Of the approximate 73 light and medium Japanese tanks from both regiments committed to the offensive, 13 were damaged beyond repair by Soviet gunfire, about 14 others were repaired after major overhauls, and 17 tanks were repaired in the field.\n\nSoviet forces concluded that the 1st Tank Corps had penetrated the defenses of their 9th Armored Brigade and 149th Infantry Regiment and had reached Soviet artillery positions.\n\nBy 1942 the Type 89 was gradually being withdrawn from front-line combat service, but many units saw action in the Battle of the Philippines, Battle of Malaya, and Burma campaign, and continued to be used in China. They were also often used in static defense positions in the Japanese-occupied islands of the Netherlands East Indies and in the South Pacific Mandate, but with their weak armor and low muzzle velocity main gun they were a poor match for the American M4 Sherman.\n\nDuring the early stages of the First Indochina War, France set up an ad hoc unit of French and Japanese armour called the \"Commando Blindé du Cambodge\" from tanks left over from the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. This unit included one Type 89B tank.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7716042", "categories": ["Medium tanks of Japan", "Tanks of the interwar period", "World War II tanks of Japan"], "title": "Type 89 I-Go medium tank"}

This is to maintain the plasma's electrical balance, as the chloride anions have been extracted.

Thus, alkaline tide is self-limited and normally lasts less than two hours.\n\nPostprandial alkaline tide has also been shown to be a causative agent of calcium oxalate urinary stones in cats, and potentially in other species.\n\nA more pronounced alkaline tide results from vomiting, which stimulates hyperactivity of gastric parietal cells to replace lost stomach acid.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716173", "text": "NMR tube\n\nAn NMR tube is a thin glass walled tube used to contain samples in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Typically NMR tubes come in 5 mm diameters but 10 mm and 3 mm samples are known. It is important that the tubes are uniformly thick and well-balanced to ensure that NMR tube spins at a regular rate (i.e., they do not wobble), usually about 20 Hz in the NMR spectrometer.\n\nNMR tubes are typically made of borosilicate glass. They are available in seven and eight inch lengths; a 5 mm tube outer diameter is most common, but 3 mm and 10 mm outer diameters are available as well. Where boron NMR is desired, quartz NMR tubes containing low concentrations of boron (as opposed to borosilicate glass) are available. Specialized closures such as J. Young valves and screwcap closures are available aside from more common polyethylene caps.\n\nTwo common specifications for NMR tubes are concentricity and camber. Concentricity refers to the variation in the radial centers, measured at the inner and outer walls. Camber refers to the \"straightness\" of the tube. Poor values for either may cause poorer quality spectra by reducing the homogeneity of the sample. In particular, an NMR tube which has poor camber may wobble when rotated, giving rise to spinning side bands. With modern manufacturing techniques even cheap tubes give good spectra for routine applications.\n\nUsually, only a small sample is dissolved in an appropriate solvent. For H NMR experiments, this will usually be a deuterated solvent such as CDCl. Sufficient solvent should be used in order to fill the tube by 4–5 cm (depending on the spectrometer). Protein NMR is usually performed in a 90% HO (or buffer)/10% DO mixture.\n\nThe sample may be sonicated or agitated to aid dissolution, and solids are removed via filtering through a plug of celite in a Pasteur pipette, directly into the NMR tube.\n\nThe NMR tube is then usually sealed with a polyethylene cap, but can be flame sealed or sealed with a Teflon 'Schlenk' tap or even a very small rubber septum. Parafilm may be wrapped around the cap to reduce solvent evaporation.\n\nA Shigemi tube is a microscale NMR tube used with an ordinary-size NMR tube. Shigemi tubes may be appropriate for protein NMR experiments, where only a smaller sample is available. A corresponding smaller solvent volume is desired to maintain a higher sample concentration. The reduced sample depth is compensated for by solid glass on the NMR tube beneath the level of sample, which varies for the make of spectrometer. Once air bubbles have been expelled, the plunger is secured to the tube proper by parafilm. Ideally, the tubes are matched with the deuterated solvent used to have better spectrum resolution.\n\nNMR tubes are hard to clean because of their small bore. They are cleaned best before the sample has dried.\n\nCleaning is performed usually by rinsing with the same (non-deuterated) solvent used to dissolve the initial sample. Dichloromethane or acetone are good choices because dichloromethane is similar in polarity to chloroform, a common NMR solvent, while acetone dissolves many organic compounds. Sonication and scrubbing with a pipe cleaner may be helpful in removing traces of solid contaminants. If necessary, the tube may be filled with an oxidizing solution of aqua regia or piranha solution (HO/HSO). Care should be taken with these solutions, as they can unexpectedly and violently erupt from the NMR tube due to pressure build-up (aque regia) or explosion (piranha). Chromic acid solutions are never used, due to traces of paramagnetic chromium left behind on the tubes causing interference with NMR experiments.\n\nWhen the NMR tube is determined to be clean, it is triple-rinsed with distilled water, acetone, and left to air-dry or dry in an oven at high-temperature. It is best not to exceed 60 °C. At higher temperatures, slight tube distortion can occur which will affect tube camber. If NMR tubes are washed, a final rinse is recommended with a solvent that easily evaporates at 60 °C and that has no residue.\n\nA better alternative to the use of potentially hazardous oxidizers is an NMR tube cleaner (right). It is an apparatus which uses a vacuum to flush solvent and/or a detergent solution through the entire length of the NMR tube.\n\nIn this apparatus, the NMR tube 1 (with the cap 3 fixed to the base of the NMR tube), is placed upside down on the apparatus. The NMR tube fits over an inner tube 5 linked to the solvent reservoir 6. The NMR cap rests on the outer tube of the apparatus 4. A vacuum is applied (usually via a water aspirator via the vacuum inlet). The NMR tube cap forms a vacuum seal. Solvent 7 is drawn from the solvent reservoir 6 and is forced to the base of the NMR tube and flushes the NMR tube out 9 with solvent cleaning it. Note to complete the vacuum a flask is attached to the NMR tube cleaning apparatus.\n\nThis sort of apparatus is commercially available, though it is costly and easy to destroy by shattering or breaking off the cleaning tube. Equivalent designs may be assembled from ordinary labware as well.\n", "id": "7716173", "categories": ["Laboratory glassware"], "title": "NMR tube"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716230", "text": "Day of the Tiles\n\nThe Day of the Tiles () was an event that took place in the French town of Grenoble on 7 June in 1788. It was one of the first disturbances which preceded the French Revolution, and is credited by a few historians as its start.\n\nGrenoble was the scene of popular unrest due to financial hardship from the economic crises. The causes of the French Revolution affected all of France, but matters came to a head first in Grenoble.\n\nUnrest in the parlementary town was sparked by the attempts of Cardinal Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne, the Archbishop of Toulouse and Controller-General of Louis XVI, to abolish the Parlements to work around their refusal to enact a new tax to deal with France's unmanageable public debt.\n\nTensions that had been rising in urban populations, due to poor harvests and the high cost of bread, were exacerbated by the refusal of the privileged classes — the Church, and the aristocracy, who insisted on retaining the right to collect feudal and seignorial royalties from their peasants and landholders — to relinquish any of their fiscal privileges. This blocked the reforms of the king's minister Charles Alexandre de Calonne and the Assembly of Notables of January 1787. Added to this, Brienne, appointed as the king's Controller-General of Finance on 8 April 1787, was widely regarded as being a manager without experience or imagination.\n\nShortly before 7 June 1788, in a large meeting at Grenoble those who attended the meeting decided to call together the old Estates of the province of Dauphiné. The government responded by sending troops to the area to put down the movement.\n\nAt roughly 10 in the morning of Saturday, 7 June, merchants closed down their shops as groups of 300 to 400 men and women formed, armed with stones, sticks, axes, bars. They rushed to the city gates to prevent the departure of judges who took part in the Grenoble meeting. Some rioters attempted to cross the Isère but faced a picket of 50 soldiers at the St. Lawrence bridge, while others headed to the Rue Neuve.\nThe cathedral’s bells were seized by French peasants at noon. The crowd swiftly grew, as the bells provoked the influx of neighbouring peasants to creep in the city, climbing the walls, using boats on the Isere and for some, pushing open the city gates.\n\nOther insurgents boarded the ramparts and rushed to the hotel (\"L'hôtel de la Première présidence\") the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre was staying in at the time. The Duke had two elite regiments in Grenoble, the Regiment of the Royal Navy (\"Régiment Royal-La-Marine)\" whose colonel was Marquis d'Ambert and the regiment of Austrasia (\"Régiment d'Austrasie\") which was commanded by Colonel Count Chabord. The Royal Navy was the first to respond to the growing crowds and was given the order to quell the rioting without the use of arms. However, as the mob stormed the hotel entrance, the situation escalated. Soldiers sent to quell the disturbances forced the townspeople off the streets. Some sources say that the soldiers were sent to disperse parliamentarians who were attempting to assemble a parliament. During an attack, Royal Navy soldiers injured a 75-year-old man with a bayonet. At the sight of blood, the people became angry and started to tear up the streets. Townspeople climbed onto the roofs of buildings around the Jesuit College to hurl down a rain of roof-tiles on the soldiers in the streets below, hence the episode's name. Many soldiers took refuge in a building to shoot through the windows, while the crowd continued to rush inside and ravage everything.\n\nA noncommissioned officer of the Royal Navy, commanding a patrol of four soldiers, gave the order to open fire into the mob. One civilian was killed and a boy of 12 wounded. To the east of the city, the Royal Navy soldiers were forced to open fire in order to protect the city's arsenal, fearing that the rioters would seize the weapons and ammunition. Meanwhile, Colonel Count Chabord began deploying the regiment of Austrasia to aid and relieve the Royal Navy soldiers.\n\nThree of the city's four consults gathered at the City Hall and attempted to reason with the crowd. However, their words were silenced amidst the clamour of the mob. Through great difficulty, the consults made their way through the crowds and eventually took refuge with the officers of the local garrison. Later that evening, the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre withdrew his troops from the streets and hotel to prevent further violence from escalating the situation. The Duke managed to narrowly escape the hotel before the crowd completely looted the inside. With control of the hotel lost, the Royal Navy troops were ordered to return to their quarters.\n\nAt six, a crowd estimated at ten thousand people shouting \"Long live the parliament\" forced the judges to return to the Palace of the Parliament of Dauphiné (\"Palais du Parlement du Dauphiné)\" by flooding them with flowers. Throughout the night, carillons sounded triumphantly, a large bonfire crackled on Saint-André square surrounded by a crowd that danced and sang \"Long live forever our parliament! May God preserve the King and the devil take Brienne and Lamoignon. \"\n\nOn 10 June, the local commander attempted to appease the spirits of the crowd, with no success. Under the orders of exile pronounced against them by the King, the parliamentarians were forced to flee from Grenoble in the morning of 12 June. It wasn’t until the 14th of July that order was fully restored in the city by Marshal Vaux, who replaced the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre.\n\nThe commander of the troops found the situation so alarming that he agreed to allow the meeting of the Estates to proceed, but not in the capital. A meeting was therefore arranged for the 21 July 1788 at the nearby village of Vizille. This meeting became known as the Assembly of Vizille.\n\nIn all, six outbreaks of rioting have been identified in the city on 7 June.\n\nThe event was commemorated by Alexandre Debelle's \"The Day of the Tiles, 13 July 1788\", painted in 1889. He painted it a century after the event and got the date wrong, but it undoubtedly attempts to depict the events described by the title.\n\nThe meeting of the three Estates which had been agreed to took place at Vizille on 21 July. Several hundred people assembled, representing the three Estates, the nobility, the clergy and the middle class (the bourgeoisie), who were granted double representation. The meeting was led by a moderate reformist lawyer, Jean Joseph Mounier, and passed resolutions:\n\nThese demands were accepted by the King. Brienne left office during August 1788, but before doing so issued a decree convoking the Estates-General for 1 May 1789. It is not clear whether this decree was prompted by the demands from the Assembly of Vizille or the Day of the Tiles, because at least one source puts the date of the decree at 7 July 1788 after the Day of the Tiles, but two weeks before the Assembly of Vizille.\n\nSince 1984, the Château de Vizille houses the Musée de la Révolution française.\n\nSome historians, such as Jonathan Sperber, have used the Day of the Tiles to demonstrate the worsening situation in France in the buildup to the French Revolution of 1789. Others have even credited it with being the beginning of the revolution itself. The events as related by R. M. Johnston provide an apparently clear link between the Day of the Tiles, the Assembly of Vizille and the start of the revolution proper.\n\n", "id": "7716230", "categories": ["History of Grenoble", "1788 riots", "1788 in France"], "title": "Day of the Tiles"}

While by far the most advanced Japanese wartime tank to reach production, industrial and material shortages resulted in only a few chassis' being manufactured and only two known to be completed. Neither Type 4 Chi-To tank saw any combat.\n\nThe Type 4 Chi-To was a thirty-ton, all-welded medium tank with a maximum armor thickness of on the frontal plates. Manned by a crew of five, it was long, high, and wide. Main armament was a turret-mounted long-barreled (4.23 m) Type 5 75 mm tank gun capable of being elevated between -6.5 to +20 degrees. An muzzle velocity gave it an armor penetration of at . The tank had a Type 97 heavy tank machine gun mounted in the hull and a ball mount on the side of the turret for a second one.\n\nThe Type 4's gasoline engine was significantly more powerful than the engine of the 19-tonne Type 3 Chi-Nu, giving it a top speed of on tracks supported by seven road wheels on each side. The tank had a range of .\n\nDevelopment of the Type 4 Chi-To began in 1943 as an intended successor to the Type 97-\"Kai\" Shinhoto Chi-Ha. The Army Technical Bureau had been working on the Type 4 Chi-To as the counter to the M4 Sherman, but there were problems and delays in the program. As a result a stopgap tank was required. The Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank was developed to cope with the M4 Sherman. Finally, the first prototype Type 4 Chi-To was delivered in 1944. Similar in appearance but significantly larger than the Type 97, it was the most advanced Japanese tank to reach the production stage.\n\nIntended Type 4 Chi-To output was 25 tanks per month; with 20 to be made at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and 5 to be produced at Kobe Seiko-sho. Late war shortage-induced delays caused by the severing of supply lines with conquered territories and U.S. strategic bombing of the Japanese mainland resulted in a total of six chassis being built. According to \"The National Institute for Defense Studies, Ministry of Defense, Military Administration of Munitions Mobilization, Production Chart of January to April of 1945\", the plan was to produce a total of 6 Type 4 Chi-To tanks in the first three months of 1945. Two Type 4 Chi-To tanks are known to have been completed in 1945 and neither saw combat.\n\nAt the end of World War II, two completed Type 4 Chi-To tanks were dumped into Lake Hamana in Shizuoka Prefecture to avoid capture by Allied occupation forces. One was recovered by the US Army, but the other was left in the lake. In 2013, there were efforts to locate the remaining tank, but it was not found.\n\n\nAnother 105mm SP gun planned was the Ka-To or Ka-To Sha 105 mm SP AT Gun. Ka-To's development was ordered in 1943. The engine placement was forward, while the gun placement was in the rear section of the hull. The open top superstructure was based on the Type 5 Na-To. Two main guns for the Ka-To were completed in 1945. According to several sources, the Ka-To hull was based on the Type 4 Chi-To, which needed to be extended in length to accommodate the main gun. An extra road wheel was added to each side of the chassis.

Mercier fled France for the United States during the Nazi invasion, eventually settling in New York City. After meeting Edward M. Greer in 1940, the two founded Greer Hydraulics (in 1942) to produce aircraft hydraulic components.\n\nIn 1943, Jean Mercier recognized an opportunity for his bladder type accumulators in Hamilton Standard’s hydromatic propellers. They needed a device that would fit inside the dome of their propeller, and have the ability to store sufficient hydraulic fluid to \"feather\" the propeller on an engine failure that might be experienced in combat. It also had to be able to function at temperatures from −40 °F to +180 °F. There was a single insurmountable problem—weight, which was a problem since World War II aircraft were quite small. The use of a gas/oil separator, today called a bladder, solved the problem.\n\nGreer and Mercier formed a patent company (Greer-Olaer) and Greer Hydraulics became the sole licensee, with the rights to continue development and to license other companies outside the U.S. From the early 1950s, bladder-type accumulators became the unit that was specified and used in almost every application where hydraulics was employed - machine tools, plastic machinery, circuit breakers, rock crushers, oil drilling, farm and road machinery, to name a few.\n\nGreer Hydraulics was later acquired by Parker-Hannifin of Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nMercier was awarded the Franklin Institute's Certificate of Merit in 1951.

Both its scientific and alternative common name honours the mammalogist Philip \"Don Felipe\" Hershkovitz.\n\nIt appears to be largely restricted to riparian habitats at an altitude of . There is extensive deforestation within its limited distribution within the northern Andes of Colombia and Ecuador, and with less than ten known specimens, it is probably the rarest carnivoran in South America. It is considered vulnerable by the IUCN.\n\nIt is the second smallest living carnivore on average, being only slightly larger than the least weasel (\"Mustela nivalis\") and slightly smaller than the ermine or stoat (\"M. erminea\"). The upperparts and tail are blackish-brown, while the underparts are orange-buff.\n\nThe first photo of a living specimen was taken by an amateur naturalist who found one trapped in his parents' house in 2011. The weasel subsequently escaped to the outdoors.\n\n\"M. felipei\" has an elongated body with an average length of , and a tail long. Weight ranges between . \"M. felipei\" has a dark dorsal color with no variation, ventrally the weasel has a light orange color with gradual fading of color up to the head. Hair color from the tail to the nose is uniform with no striping or spotting. \"M. felipei\" has an inflated auditory bulla located near the dorsal midline on the body, along with a wide mesopterygoid fossa. The soles of the feet lack any fur, and extensive webbing is located on the second, third, and fourth digits, suggesting a semi-aquatic lifestyle.\n\n\"M. felipei\" is one of the least studied carnivore species in the Americas, and is expected to maintain a larger geographical range that currently known. Reports of sightings have placed \"M. felipei\" in the mountain ranges of western Colombia to northern Ecuador. \"M. felipei\" was originally thought to be endemic to Colombia however recent specimens have been collected in Ecuador that have since proven this thought wrong. Distribution and habitat modeling surveys have been able to predict that \"M. felipei\" is distributed between 20 protected areas in Colombia, and 14 in Ecuador along with three previously known locations in both countries, the majority of these locations lie in protected areas of the forest.\n\nFrom geographic modeling, and collected specimens it has been concluded that \"Mustela felipei\" lives in largely riparian habitats, primarily staying close to rivers, streams, and along the shorelines of other natural water sources. Since this habitat lies in an elevation range of it is classified as being in a \"cloud forest\" consisting of 100% humidity adding to the riparian habitat.\n\n\"M. felipei\" is a carnivorous mammal that preys primarily on fish, other small aquatic animals, and small terrestrial mammals. Hunting is aided by the use of webbed feet and camouflaged fur.\n\n\"Mustela felipei\" has been recognized by the IUCN as being vulnerable and having a decreasing population.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716459", "text": "Ameny Qemau\n\nAmeny Qemau was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty during the Second Intermediate Period. According to Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker, he was the 5th king of the dynasty, reigning for 2 years over most of Egypt, except perhaps the eastern Nile Delta, from 1793 BC until 1791 BC.\n\nThe Egyptologist Kim Ryholt notes that Ameny Qemau's name is essentially a filiative nomen, that is, a name specifying the filiation of its holder. Indeed, Ameny Qemau could be read as \"Ameny['s son] Qemau\". Ryholt concludes that the Ameny in question was Qemau's predecessor Sekhemkare Amenemhat V and that Qemau was his son. This opinion is shared by Egyptologist Darrell Baker but not by Jürgen von Beckerath, who left Ameny Qemau's position within the 13th Dynasty undetermined in his handbook of Egyptian pharaohs. The successor of Ameny Qemau, Qemau Siharnedjheritef may have been his son as \"Qemau Siharnedjheritef\" may be read \"The son of Qemau, Horus protects his father\".\n\nBeyond his pyramid in Dahshur, Ameny Qemau is a poorly attested king: his name does not appear on the Turin canon and the only contemporary attestations of him are fragments of four inscribed canopic jars found in the pyramid. An additional plaquette of unknown provenance bears his name but may be a modern forgery.\nAmeny Qemau's identity is therefore uncertain and attempts have been made to identify him with better attested kings of the period, in particular with \"Sehotepibre\", who appears on the Turin canon after Amenemhat V. Ryholt however believes that Qemau's name was lost in a \"wsf\" lacuna of the Turin canon located just before Amenemhat V. A \"wsf\" (literally \"missing\") lacuna denotes a lacuna in the original document from which the canon was copied in Ramesside times.\n\nAmeny Qemau had a pyramid built for himself in the south of Dahshur. The pyramid was discovered in 1957 by Charles Musès and only investigated in 1968. It originally measured 50 square meters at its base and stood 35 meters high but is now completely ruined due to stone robbing. The substructures have also been extensively damaged. The burial chamber of the king was made of a single large block of quartzite, similar to those found in the pyramid of Amenemhat III at Hawara and the Mazghuna pyramids. The block was hewn to receive the sarcophagus and canopic jars of the king but only fragments of these and unidentified bones where found onsite.\n\nAdditionally, the name of Ameny Qemau is believed to appear on an inscribed block which was found in a newly-discovered pyramid at Dahshur whose existence was announced in April 2017. Many Egyptologists such as James P. Allen, Aidan Dodson and Thomas Schneider agrees that the royal name on the block is that of Ameny Qemau. Dodson further speculated that, given the relatively poor quality of the inscription and the oddity for a pharaoh to be the owner of two pyramids, the newly-discovered one may have originally belonged to one of Qemau's predecessors, and that he may have usurped the structure by chiseling out the royal names on the block and superimposing his own cartouches on it. Among the artifacts found in the burial chamber were a sarcophagus, canopic jars, and boxes of wrappings. Inscriptions on the boxes mention one of the daughters of Ameny Qemau, Hatshepsut, suggesting that the pyramid may have been usurped for his daughter and may explain why he has two pyramids.\n", "id": "7716459", "categories": ["18th-century BC Pharaohs"], "title": "Ameny Qemau"}

The park is located on Pennsylvania Route 144, north of Renovo and south of Galeton. Ole Bull State Park is in the Kettle Creek Valley, and is surrounded by Susquehannock State Forest. The woods surrounding the park are called the Black Forest because of its once dense tree cover.\n\nOle Bull State Park is named for Ole Borneman Bull. Ole Bull was a famous Norwegian violinist. He visited the United States several times and played with great success. While visiting the United States, Bull became interested in founding a colony for his fellow countrymen. In 1852, he purchased of land for $10,000 in Pennsylvania and founded the colony, which was called New Norway. He established four communities, New Bergen (now known as Carter Camp), Oleana, New Norway and Valhalla in the Kettle Creek area. Ole Bull began work on a \"castle\", which he named Nordjenskald. The castle and the communities were abandoned in less than a year. The problems encountered by the Norwegian pioneers were mainly based on the inexperience of the farmers in dealing with clearing the land of its many trees. Efforts to settle the area were parodied in the 1853 Norwegian folk song Oleanna, which was translated into English and popularized by Pete Seeger in 1955. The Norwegians, however, did not give up. They migrated west into Minnesota and the Dakotas. The settlement may have failed, but Ole Bull was not forgotten. The citizens of Norway paid for the construction of a monument to honor Ole Bull. The statue was placed in the park on the 150th anniversary of New Norway in 2002.\n\nThe Kettle Creek area was part of the massive lumbering operation that occurred in most of north central Pennsylvania in the 1880s and 1890s. The lumbering industry harvested the old-growth white pine and hemlock. Two railroads were built on the banks of Kettle Creek to haul the timber to sawmills in the Cross Fork area. The old-growth forest was soon gone. The land was no longer useful to the lumber industry and it fell into disuse. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased much of the land and Ole Bull State Park was opened in 1925.\n\nMany of the facilities at Ole Bull State Park were constructed during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps founded by American President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The CCC created many jobs for the out of work industrial workers from throughout the United States. Ole Bull State Park is home to many examples of the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps throughout North Central Pennsylvania. They built outhouses, pavilions, and the camping areas. The CCC also built the original dam in the swimming area.\n\nHunting is permitted on of Ole Bull State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania State Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, squirrels, turkey, white-tailed deer, and black bears. Many more acres of forested woodlands are available for hunting on the grounds of the adjacent Susquehannock State Forest.\n\nThe water quality of Kettle Creek and Ole Bull Run is very good. The waters offer fishing for brook, rainbow and brown trout. There is a special fishing area of children and people with disabilities near the dam on Kettle Creek. Fishing is prohibited between the wires at the dam basin and in the swimming area.\n\nSwimming is permitted at the sandy beach on Kettle Creek during the months of May through mid-September. Swim at your own risk. Lifeguards are not provided. Pets are not permitted at the beach.\n\nCamping is permitted year round at Ole Bull State Park. There are two camping areas on the banks of Kettle Creek. Some of the sites are sunny and some are shaded. There are 24 electric hookups at one campsite and 21 at the other. All campsites have a level gravel pad for setting up campers. They also feature a fire ring and a picnic table. Modern restrooms, water hydrants and a sanitary dump station are available at Ole Bull State Park.\n\nThe picnic area is on the bank of Kettle Creek across from the swimming area. There are four pavilions, many picnic tables, a playground, fireplaces, a restroom and water hydrants. There is electricity at the Stone Pavilion. These pavilion must be reserved in order to have access to the electricity. \n\nOle Bull State Park is a trailhead for the Susquehannock Trail System. It also of self-contained trails. The Daugherty Loop Trail uses old logging roads and a railroad grade to pass through the Black Forest of Pennsylvania. The Beaver Dam Nature Trail follows Kettle Creek for . The Ole Bull Trail leads to the remains of Ole Bull's \"castle\", Nordjenskald. This area is the site of a panoramic view of the park. In the winter months cross country skiing, snow shoes and snow mobiles are permitted.\n\nThe following state parks are within of Ole Bull State Park:\n\n", "id": "7716460", "categories": ["1925 establishments in Pennsylvania", "Parks in Potter County, Pennsylvania", "Campgrounds in Pennsylvania", "Civilian Conservation Corps in Pennsylvania", "State parks of Pennsylvania", "Protected areas established in 1925"], "title": "Ole Bull State Park"}

Gill\n\nRichard David Gill (born 11 September 1951) is a mathematician born in the United Kingdom who has lived in the Netherlands since 1974. As a probability theorist and statistician, Gill is most well known for his research on counting processes and survival analysis, some of which has appeared in an advanced textbook. He is the chair of mathematical statistics at Leiden University. Gill is also known for his pro bono consulting and advocacy on behalf of victims of incompetent statistical testimony, including a Dutch nurse who was wrongfully convicted and jailed for six years.\n\nHe studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge (1970–1973), and subsequently followed the Diploma of Statistics course there (1973–1974).\n\nMarrying a Dutch woman, he moved to the Netherlands where he worked from 1974 to 1988 at the Mathematical Centre (later renamed \"Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica\", or CWI) of Amsterdam. In 1979, Gill obtained his PhD with the thesis \"Censoring and Stochastic Integrals\", which was supervised by Jacobus Oosterhoff of the Vrije Universiteit, which awarded the doctorate. Gill spent Autumn 1980 at the Statistical Research Unit at the University of Copenhagen. Gill continued to collaborate with Danish (and Norwegian) statisticians for ten years, helping to write the book \"Statistical models based on counting processes\", which is often referred to as \"ABGK\" (for the authors Andersen, Borgan, Gill, and Keiding). In 1983 he became the head of the Department of Mathematical Statistics at CWI.\n\nIn 1988 he moved to the Department of Mathematics of Utrecht University. Gill became the chair in mathematical stochastics—this chair represented the three mathematical sciences of mathematical statistics, probability theory, and operations research. His PhD students include Sara van de Geer and Mark van der Laan.\n\nIn 2006, he moved to the Department of Mathematics at Leiden University, where he became the chair of mathematical statistics. Since then, he has conducted statistical research in the theory of quantum information and in biostatistics. He has also worked on survival analysis, semiparametric models, causality, missing data, machine learning, and statistics in image analysis. Gill also publishes on the foundations of several mathematical sciences: the foundations of statistics, of probability, of mathematics, and of quantum physics.\n\nIn recent years he has lobbied for retrials for Lucia de Berk and Kevin Sweeney. The nurse Lucia de Berk was sentenced to life imprisonment, after a legal psychologist gave testimony that there was great likelihood that de Berk committed a string of murders.\"The court was told by Dr Henk Elffers of the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement that more children had died on her shifts than appeared possible by chance. He put the odds of her presence being a mere coincidence at one in 342 million, a figure that seemed to have blinded the court to any alternative explanation of the deaths.\"This statistical testimony was shown to be fallacious by professional statisticians, notably Gill. Continued scrutiny showed that the data had also been collected to support the prosecutor's conviction of Berk, which further invalidated the pseudo-statistical testimony.\n\n\"The conduct of the case, in Professor Gill's account, was extraordinary. Convinced she was guilty, the police and the managers of the Juliana Children's Hospital assembled a dossier in which it seemed every death became unnatural when it had occurred during, or after, a shift in which she had worked. For one of the alleged murders, it was established on appeal she had not even been in the hospital for three days around the time it occurred. Using more appropriate statistical methods reduced the odds from one in 342 million to one in 48. A further analysis by Professor Gill further reduces the odds to one in nine.\"\n\nProfessor Gill helped in the campaign to have a new trial. Consequently, a retrial was ordered, and de Berk was found not guilty, and received a public apology from the Dutch government, along with financial compensation (amount unknown) for her six years of incarceration.\n\nRichard Gill is a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is a past president of The Netherlands Society for Statistics and Operations Research, which publishes the journal \"Statistica Neerlandica\". Gill was selected as the 2010–2011 Distinguished Lorentz Fellow by the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in Humanities and Social Sciences.\n\n", "id": "7716518", "categories": ["20th-century Dutch mathematicians", "English statisticians", "1951 births", "Probability theorists", "Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences", "Alumni of the University of Cambridge", "ISI highly cited researchers", "Living people", "English mathematicians", "British expatriates in the Netherlands", "People from Redhill, Surrey", "Dutch academics", "Leiden University faculty", "Dutch statisticians", "British operations researchers", "21st-century mathematicians", "Dutch operations researchers"], "title": "Richard D.

It was a sacred site for Native American tribes of the Great Plains and, for a time, became the site of a health spa for American settlers. With the completion of the Glen Elder Dam in 1968, the mineral spring disappeared beneath the waters of Waconda Reservoir.\n\nWaconda Spring was situated on the bank of the Solomon River, below the North and South Forks of the river.\nThe water flowing from the spring had deposited a large cone of travertine around it.\nIn 1866, surveyor David E. Ballard described it:\n\nThe Spring itself is a natural curiousity, it being located on the summit of a cone shaped limestone rock. The rock is circular, about 200 feet in diameter at the base and about 30 feet high, upon the summit of this, rests the spring, the basin being circular and about 30 feet in diameter, its outlet is a trough apparently formed by the action of the water upon the rock. The water in the spring is about 20 feet deep and exceedingly strong with salt ...\n\nThe name \"Waconda\" is from the Kanza language, and translates as \"spirit water\" or \"Great Spirit Spring\". However, it is located in territory controlled by the Pawnee,\nwho knew it by the names \"Pahowa\" and \"Kitzawitzuk\", the latter translated as \"water on a bank\". \n\nIn the Pawnee traditional religion, the supreme being Tirawa allots supernatural powers to certain animals. These animals, the \"nahurac\", act as Tirawa's servants and messengers, and intercede for the Pawnee with Tirawa. \n\nThe \"nahurac\" had five lodges, of which Waconda Spring was one. The foremost among them was Pahuk, usually translated \"hill island\", a bluff on the south side of the Platte River, near the town of Cedar Bluffs in present-day Saunders County, Nebraska. \nLalawakohtito, or \"dark island\", was an island in the Platte near Central City, Nebraska; Ahkawitakol, or \"white bank\", was on the Loup River opposite the mouth of the Cedar River in what is now Nance County, Nebraska; and Pahur, or \"hill that points the way\", was a bluff south of the Republican River, near Guide Rock, Nebraska.\n\nBeside the Pawnee, many other Native American tribes venerated Waconda Spring, often casting articles of value into it as offerings. George Bird Grinnell describes the offerings of the Pawnee as including blankets and robes, blue beads, eagle feathers, and moccasins.\n\nA geoglyph, produced by the intaglio technique of removing the surface sod to form a figure, is located on a hillside about two miles southwest of Waconda Spring. The figure represents an unidentified animal, possibly a beaver. It is thought to be several hundred years old; soil analysis indicates that it was renewed at least once after its initial excavation, suggesting that it was in use over an extended period of time.\n\nIt is said that the first European explorer to visit Waconda Spring was Sir William Johnson in 1767; however, this is unlikely. The first recorded visit to the site was by General Zebulon Pike in 1806. Pike visited the spring during his exploration of the Great Plains after he had concluded a treaty with the Pawnee.\n\nSettlement in the area did not take place until after Kansas became a state in 1861. The first settler in the region was in 1870 by a man named Pfeiffer, who took out the first claim on the property. Kansas Senator Samuel C. Pomeroy toured the region in 1870 and marveled at what he saw. Said Pomeroy, \"At first I declared it the Crater of an Ancient Volcano. The Water occupying its hollow center is fathomless, and about 200 feet in diameter in a perfect circle! It is always brimming full and running over on all sides ... The hills about it were as sacred to the Indians as those about Jerusalem.\" Pomeroy recognized the site's commercial potential and went on to predict that a health resort would soon be built in the region.\n\nWithin a few years, a man named Burnham constructed a bottling works on the site and began selling the mineral water as a health tonic. He called it \"Waconda Flier\". The sales of \"Waconda Flier\" piqued the interest of an eastern investor named McWilliams, who in 1884 invested in the site and began the construction of a stone sanitarium. The spring was fenced off and completely privatized. The building was completed ten years later, and under the management of G. W. Cooper, Waconda Spring became a hotel and health spa. Sales of \"Waconda Flier\" continued, and by the 1890s it was being sold in all parts of the country. In 1904, \"Waconda Flier\" won a medal for its superior medicinal qualities at the St. Louis World's Fair.\n\nIn 1906, Dr. G. P. Abrahams purchased the property from McWilliams and continued operating the health spa and bottling plant until his 1924 death. In 1924, the property passed to Dr. Carl Bingesser, who had married Abrahams' daughter Anna in 1907. Under both Abrahams and Bingesser, the hotel resort was improved upon and maintained a solid reputation as health spa and place of healing. It continued to do so even as the spa passed on to Dr. Carlos Bingesser, the third generation of the Abrahams-Bingesser family to own and operate the spa. The facilities were fully modernized and offered physical therapy, hydro-therapy, electro-therapy, and dietary regimens. Water from Waconda Spring was used for internal and external cleansing of the body. It was piped into every bathtub in the sanitarium, was served with meals, and used for enemas. A popular slogan used to lure tourists to the resort was, \"It will clean works until your works work.\" Waconda Spring was a popular, profitable enterprise for the Bingesser family.\n\nIn 1944 the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers announced plans for a large earthen dam on the Solomon River near the town of Glen Elder. The plan called for the inundation of Waconda Spring. The Bingesser family fought to stop the plan, but in 1951 greater than normal rainfall in Kansas led to massive flooding in Topeka and other Kansas towns. This led to renewed calls for dams and other flood control projects, including renewed calls for the Glen Elder Dam. Dr. Bingesser brought in a respected hydrologist to inspect Waconda Spring. The hydrologist concluded that Waconda Spring was unique and possibly the only spring like it in the world. However, commercial advocates in favor of the dam dismissed the hydrologist and dismissively claimed that Waconda Spring was nothing more than a \"mud hole.\"\n\nIn the end, the developers won. Construction on Glen Elder Dam began in 1964 and was completed by the end of 1968. Engineers bulldozed the hotel and health spa then, adding insult to injury, dumped the debris into the pool of Waconda Spring. Water from the Solomon River began filling up the valley, and by 1970 it was full. The irreplaceable Waconda Spring was lost beneath the waters of the reservoir that now bears its name.\n\n\n", "id": "7716530", "categories": ["Bodies of water of Mitchell County, Kansas", "Sacred springs", "Landmarks in Kansas", "Springs of Kansas", "Former rivers", "Religious places of the indigenous peoples of North America", "Native American history of Kansas", "Sacred places of the Pawnee", "Recreational areas in Kansas"], "title": "Waconda Spring"}

Later in that war it changed to the transport role, disbanding after the end of the hostilities.\n\nNo. 298 Squadron was formed on 24 August 1942 at RAF Thruxton from a nucleus of 297 Squadron as a special operations squadron, equipped with the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. The squadron was however not required for operations, so the formation was suspended and the squadron was disbanded on 19 October 1942.\n\nThe squadron was re-formed on 4 November 1943 at RAF Tarrant Rushton, from 'A' Flight of 295 Squadron, with the Handley Page Halifax. It trained to air-tow the big General Aircraft Hamilcar glider, but began operations in February 1944 in its original role, dropping SOE agents. On 16 March 1944 298 Squadrons 'C' Flight split off, to form 644 squadron.\n\nDuring the Normandy landing the squadron air-towed both the Airspeed Horsas and the Hamilcars to landing-zones around the beach head. An unusual operation involved parachuting jeeps which had been carried underneath the Halifax. The squadron then returned again to SOE duties. In between the SOE duties the squadron air-towed Hamilcar and Horsa gliders for the Arnhem landing (Operation Market Garden). The squadron moved in March 1945 to RAF Woodbridge, England to air-tow gliders for the Rhine crossing (Operation Varsity). After Operation Varsity the squadron flew normal supply and transport duties.\n\nIn July 1945 the squadron moved to Raipur, British India to provide transport support to the Army. In March 1946 the squadron was involved in rice-dropping sorties from Meiktila, Burma to the starving population in the jungle areas. The squadron disbanded at Mauripur, Sindh, British India (Now Pakistan Air Force Base Masroor) on 21 December or 30 December 1946.\n\n\n", "id": "7716541", "categories": ["Military units and formations disestablished in 1946", "Special Operations Executive", "Military units and formations established in 1942", "Military units and formations of the Royal Air Force in World War II"], "title": "No. 298 Squadron RAF"}

These models, except for those with the \"US\" designation, were designed primarily as rugged motorcycles to pull sidecars (mounting points were built in) and had duplex tubular steel frames.\n\nSimultaneously manufactured were related models, including the 500 cc R50 (1955–1960, ), the R50/2 (1960–1969, 26 hp), the R50 S (1960–1962, ), the R50US (1968–1969, 26 hp), and the 600 cc sport-oriented R69 (1955–1960, 35 hp), R69S (1960–1969, ), and R69US (1968–1969, 42 hp).\n\nIn the United States, all these Earles-fork and US-fork (i.e., telescopic fork) models from 1955 to 1969 are often lumped together as \"Slash-2\" BMWs, even though that is technically incorrect. Not all of them, as seen above, have the \"/2\" designation.\n\nPerhaps the most famous BMW rider of the 1960s was Danny Liska, who took R60 models from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego in one trip, and from Europe's North Cape to South Africa's Cape of Good Hope in a second journey. His book about the first trip, \"Two Wheels to Adventure (Alaska to Argentina by Motorcycle)\", was published in 1989 with a second edition published in 2004. In the book \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\", John and Sylvia accompany Robert Pirsig, the author, and his son Chris, on a 1968 road trip from Minnesota to San Francisco, riding a BMW R60. Throughout the book Pirsig contrasts his passion and care in taking care of his bike to John's fear of technology: \"The BMW is famous for not giving mechanical problems on the road and that's what he is counting on.\"\n\nThough BMW first used oil-damped telescopic front forks in the 1930s, it chose to use \"Earles\" forks on these models. The triangular front Earles fork, named after its designer, Englishman Ernest Earles,\nprecluded any front-end dive during heavy front braking, which is common with telescopic front forks. It also worked well in sidecar duty. Though heavy and ponderous in turning, the Earles fork gave the old Beemer a steady and reassuring ride.\n\nIn 1968, BMW introduced telescopic forks on some of its slash-2 models, and they were continued into the 1969 model year. Modified, they became the front forks on the slash-5 models introduced for the 1970 model year. The photo of the red R60US to the right was taken at a BMW dealership in 1968 and shows a brand-new motorcycle waiting for its first buyer. Earles fork and telescopic fork models both were manufactured for these two years and were available to customers.\n\nDuring the 1960s, very few motorcycles were available with shaft final drive. BMW's were the most common. The driveshaft rode in an enclosed oil bath within the right swingarm, unlike BMW's previous models, and drove the rear wheel through an internally splined cup that meshes with a coupler crown gear keyed to the drive pinion. This meant that leaking seals could become a problem for the owners. Because the clutch was dry, there were seals at the rear of the crankshaft, at both ends of the transmission, at the rear of the driveshaft, and at the front and rear of the rear drive unit: lots of seals to develop leaks.\n\nThe front brakes were double leading shoes, and the rear had a single leading shoe. By modern standards, they were not good brakes. Tires, front and rear, were interchangeable in 3.50 inch by 18 inch size.\n\nMotorcycles sold in America had high handlebars with a cross brace. Those sold elsewhere came with low, \"Euro\" handlebars.\n\nA variety of saddle styles were available for these motorcycles. Those delivered in the U. S. typically were supplied with a single \"dual\" or bench saddle, either the standard size or a wide version that came with chrome rear-quarter passenger handles. Alternatives available included a Denfeld (\"not\" \"Denfield\") or Pagusa solo driver's saddle, or individual driver and passenger saddles.\n\nBMW motorcycles of the 1960s were noted as long-distance touring motorcycles. However, none came standard with fairings or luggage; these items were provided by aftermarket vendors.\nFairings included the Wixom Ranger handlebar-mounted fairing made in Illinois, and Avon.\nThere were numerous manufacturers of saddle bags and top cases for BMW twins in the 1960s including Wixom, British-made Craven, and leather saddlebags imported by Butler and Smith, who also offered several styles of luggage carriers for mounting behinds the passenger saddle. It also offered several styles of windshields, safety bars, a spotlight, metric tool kits, and a mechanical tachometer.\n\nU.S. motorcycles came standard with a narrow dual saddle, though wide dual saddles with chrome rear handles could be ordered. Solo saddles made by Pagusa or Denfeld for driver and passenger were also available. All motorcycles came with a tool kit. Hella turn signals were optional (photo below left), and were mounted at the ends of the handlebars showing light both forward and back.\n\nThe standard fuel tank held , though a commonly purchased option was a more bulbous tank. Also available as options were sport tanks of and capacities.\n\nAn oval shaped safety bar (photo right) was available for all 1955–69 BMW motorcycles from the American importer, Butler and Smith, New York.\nEngine Numbers\n\nEngine\n\n\nPower Transmission\n\n\nElectrical System\n\n\nSuspension\n\n\nDimensions and Weights\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\n", "id": "7716557", "categories": ["Motorcycles powered by flat engines", "BMW motorcycles", "Shaft drive motorcycles", "Standard motorcycles"], "title": "BMW R60/2"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716582", "text": "Aniseikonia\n\nAniseikonia is an ocular condition where there is a significant difference in the perceived size of images. It can occur as an overall difference between the two eyes, or as a difference in a particular meridian.\n\nWhen this magnification difference becomes excessive the effect can cause diplopia, suppression, disorientation, eyestrain, headache, and dizziness and balance disorders.\n\nRetinal image size is determined by many factors. The size and position of the object being viewed affects the characteristics of the light entering the system. Corrective lenses affect these characteristics and are used commonly to correct refractive error. The optics of the eye including its refractive power and axial length also play a major role in retinal image size.\n\nAniseikonia can occur naturally or be induced by the correction of a refractive error, usually anisometropia (having significantly different refractive errors between each eye) or antimetropia (being myopic (nearsighted) in one eye and hyperopic (farsighted) in the other.) Meridional aniseikonia occurs when these refractive differences only occur in one meridian (see astigmatism). Refractive surgery can cause aniseikonia in much the same way that it is caused by glasses and contacts.\n\nOne cause of significant anisometropia and subsequent aniseikonia has been aphakia. Aphakic patients do not have a crystalline lens. The crystalline lens is often removed because of opacities called cataracts. The absence of this lens left the patient highly hyperopic (farsighted) in that eye. For some patients the removal was only performed on one eye, resulting in the anisometropia / aniseikonia. Today, this is rarely a problem because when the lens is removed in cataract surgery, an intraocular lens, or IOL is left in its place.\n\nA way to demonstrate aniseikonia is to hold a near target (ex. pen or finger) approximately 6 inches directly in front of one eye. The person then closes one eye, and then the other. The person should notice that the target appears larger to the eye that it is directly in front of. When this object is viewed with both eyes, it is seen with a small amount of aniseikonia. The principles behind this demonstration are relative distance magnification (closer objects appear larger) and asymmetrical convergence (the target is not an equal distance from each eye).\n\nTreatment is done by changing the optical magnification properties of the auxiliary optics (corrective lenses). The optical magnification properties of spectacle lenses can be adjusted by changing parameters like the base curve, vertex distance, and center thickness. Contact lenses may also provide a better optical magnification to reduce the difference in image size. The difference in magnification can also be eliminated by a combination of contact lenses and glasses (creating a weak telescope system). The optimum design solution will depend on different parameters like cost, cosmetic implications, and if the patient can tolerate wearing a contact lens.\n\nNote however that before the optics can be designed, first the aniseikonia should be measured. When the image disparity is astigmatic (cylindrical) and not uniform, images can appear wider, taller, or diagonally different. When the disparity appears to vary across the visual field (field-dependent aniseikonia), as may be the case with an epiretinal membrane or retinal detachment, the aniseikonia cannot fully be corrected with traditional optical techniques like standard corrective lenses. However, partial correction often improves the patient's vision comfort significantly. Little is known yet about the possibilities of using surgical intervention to correct aniseikonia.\n\nGr. \"an\" = \"not\", + \"is(o)\" = \"equal,\" + \"eikōn\" = \"image\"</small>\n\n\n", "id": "7716582", "categories": [], "title": "Aniseikonia"}

Architect Mihajlo Janković, was awarded the Belgrade's October award for architecture, the highest city award at the time, for the Tašmajdan project. Originally, the sports complex started as the ice factory, where people could buy the so-called \"hygienic ice\".\n\nSome of the best known happenings in the venue include: EuroBasket Women 1954, first Miss Yugoslavia contest in 1957 (won by Tonka Katunarić), 1957 World Women's Handball Championship (the inaugural world women championship), concerts of Alexandrov Ensemble in 1958 and later in the 1960s and 1970s of Mazowsze, Elton John, Ray Charles and Tina Turner and ice hockey matches with over 10,000 spectators. Yugoslav national tennis team played the Davis Cup matches in 1956 in Tašmajdan and the curiosities held in the facility include the chess with live figures, the football matches played by the Zastava 750 cars and the first Spanish corrida in Europe outside of Spain, when Luis Miguel Dominguín performed. Tašmajdan hosted the first FINA World Aquatics Championships in 1973.\n\nAfter the 1977-78 season, the ice skating rink was dismantled in March 1978. Bad conditions of the facility in the 2000s led many public personalities in Belgrade (Cane Kostić, Neda Arnerić, Branko Cvejić) to urge the city government to do something about it. In mid-April 2009, the initiative called \"\"Taš je naš\"\" (; \"Taš is ours\") was held to draw public attention to the sad state of the crumbling facility. In the summer of 2009 the stadium was closed to the public due to the impending reconstruction. An extensive RSD550 million renovation began in September 2011. Originally, the reconstruction was to be finished in December 2012, then was postponed to 2014 and was finally completed in 2016.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716620", "text": "Pasteur pipette\n\nPasteur pipettes, also known as droppers or eye droppers, are used to transfer small quantities of liquids. They are usually glass tubes tapered to a narrow point, and fitted with a rubber bulb at the top. The combination of the Pasteur pipette and rubber bulb has also been referred to as a teat pipette. Pasteur pipettes come in various lengths and are usually sold in boxes of hundreds. They are named after the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who was known to have used a variant of them extensively during his research. In the past, there was no equipment to transfer a chemical solution without exposing it to the external environment. The hygiene and purity of chemical compounds is necessary for the expected result of each experiment. The Pasteur pipette, both glass and plastic types, are sterilized and plugged with a rubber bulb at the open end of the pipette preventing any contamination from the atmosphere. Generally, they are considered cheap enough to be disposable, however, so long as the glass point is not chipped, the Pasteur pipette may be washed and reused indefinitely.\n\nThe name eye dropper also may refer to early models of fountain-pens, which have to be refilled with some kind of Pasteur pipette.\n\nIt is not recommended to use pasteur pipettes for work involving accuracy since pasteur pipettes are not designed to measure specific volume; however, it can be used to add drops of reagents. Before using a pasteur pipette, the tip should be carefully examined for cracks. To increase accuracy, the pipette is to be rinsed with the reagent. To use the pipette, squeeze the bulb to expel air out of the pipette and submerge the tip of the pipette to the solution vertically. Gently relax the bulb to draw the solution up and make sure that the solution does not overshoot into the bulb contaminating it. To dispense the reagent, hold the tip against the side of the target container at a 30 to 45 degrees angle.\n\nBroken pasteur pipettes should be disposed of in an appropriate glassware container.\n\nNowadays, the two types of glass that are used mainly in the laboratory and in the Pasteur pipette are borosilicate glass and soda lime glass. Borosilicate glass is a widely used glass for laboratory apparatus, as it can withstand chemicals and temperatures used in most laboratories. Borosilicate glass is also more economical since the glass can be fabricated easily compared to other types. Soda lime glass, although not as chemically resistant as Borosilicate glass, are suitable as a material for inexpensive apparatus such as the Pasteur pipette.\n\nPlastic Pasteur pipettes, also referred to as transfer pipettes, have their stems and bulbs in the form of a single piece made of plastic. They commonly come in 1, 2, 3, and 5 ml which comes with a specific drop size of 10, 20, 25, 35, and 50 µl. The volumes are usually marked on the stem, though the markings are rather crude and are not particularly accurate.\n\nAs plastic Pasteur is relatively inexpensive and disposable, they are often used to avoid cross-contamination. In a solution containing cell and/or protein, it reduces the loss of cell and/or protein that binds to glass. The designation of the plastic pipettes contain the long flexible tube. It can be bent for drawing solution from small volume tubes.\n\nPlastic Pasteur pipettes are often used in biology where most media are aqueous and solvent resistance is not important. (Most organic solvents, such as hexane and acetone cannot be used in plastic Pasteur pipettes as the solvent can dissolve the plastic.) The pipettes are also hard to wash and are usually discarded with other biohazard waste after each use.\n\nPlastic bulb pipettes are generally not precise enough to be used for exact measurements, whereas their glass counterparts can be extremely precise.\n\nThe constriction toward the tip of the Pasteur pipettes may be plugged with a bit of tissue paper or cotton wool to filter off solids from small amounts of liquids. The bulb can be attached and squeezed to help viscous solutions filter more rapidly.\n\nWith a bit of skill, Pasteur pipettes may also be used for microscale column chromatography. With appropriately fine silica gel, the bulb may be squeezed for microscale flash column chromatography.\n\nPasteur pipettes can also be used for microscale distillation. The liquid to be distilled is placed into a small reaction tube along with a boiling chip and heated to reflux one-half to two-thirds of the way up the inside of the tube. After squeezing the bulb to expel air, a pasteur pipette is inserted into the tube just below the level of the ring of refluxing liquid (into the vapor). The vapor is then drawn into the relatively cold pipette tip, causing it to condense and accumulate inside of the pipette.\n\nHeat can be applied to the tip of a plastic Pasteur pipette to seal the solution and create a liquid-tight storage.\n\nMedical Laboratory\n\nMedical Laboratory required high efficiency and precision for drug test and observation of diseases. Pasteur pipettes are commonly used in the medical lab because of its essential accuracy. The design of the Pasteur pipette allows for high effective performance in the medical lab. It produces a constant volume of drop. This reduces the concern of liquid remaining in the pipette.\n\n", "id": "7716620", "categories": [], "title": "Pasteur pipette"}

It was founded in Austin, Texas in August 1988 by Dr. Roger D. Ross, a leading computer scientist who headed Motorola's Advanced Microprocessor Division and directed the developments of Motorola's MC68030 and RISC-based 88000 microprocessor families.\n\nDr. Ross was accompanied by Carl Dobbs, Janet Sooch, Steve Goldstein and Travor Smith, who were from Motorola's High-end Microprocessor Division, and were involved in the development of the 88000 microprocessor. He was later was joined by Am29000 engineer Raju Vegesna from AMD, who was originally hired by Dr. Ross at Motorola.\n\nCypress Semiconductor provided initial funding. Original board members included Dr. Ross and well-known figures as Dr. T. J. Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor, John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Venture Capital, and L. J. Sevin of Sevin Rosen Venture Capital, who also served as Board Chairman. Ross eventually became a subsidiary of Cypress.\n\nIn September 1988, the company was tied up in a lawsuit launched by Motorola. Motorola alleged that Ross and the other former Motorola staff had proprietary marketing material as well as all the 68000 and 88000 technical data, and sought a temporary injunction and $8 million in compensation and punitive damages. Motorola offered to settle the lawsuit without litigation if the former Motorola staff agreed not to work on modern computer architecture for 18 months. In late September 1988, Motorola withdrew the temporary injunction after former Motorola staff agreed not to compromise proprietary information regarding the 68000 and 88000 microprocessors. The lawsuit was settled in October.\n\nIn mid-October, after the lawsuit from Motorola was settled, AMD launched a lawsuit over the hiring of Raju Vegesna, who was involved in the design of the Am29000. It was settled in late October, with AMD getting limited rights to inspect Ross' RISC-related designs.\n\nRoss' first products were SPARC chip sets. On 23 April 1990, Cypress announced the CY7C611 a microprocessor developed by Ross for embedded applications. Later, Ross was tasked by Cypress to develop the \"Pinnacle\" microprocessor, a superscalar SPARC implementation intended to compete with the Sun Microsystems and Texas Instruments SuperSPARC. In May 1993, \"Pinnacle\" was revealed to be the hyperSPARC, and the microprocessor was announced in May 1993.\n\nCypress had bet the company's success on the hyperSPARC, threatening to abandon SPARC in favor of Digital Equipment Corporation's Alpha if Sun did not endorse the design. Although International Computers Limited and Meiko Scientific were claimed by Cypress to be major customers of hyperSPARC, the microprocessor was used in small quantities and by a handful of small vendors. Repeated delays in shipping the design, as a result of design and fabrication problems at Cypress contributed to the small number of users.\n\nAs the hyperSPARC had failed to win major customers, Cypress sold Ross to Fujitsu for $23 million on 12 May 1993. Fujitsu was interested in Ross for its hyperSPARC design, which it considered to be competitive. At the time, Fujitsu's SPARC business was limited to embedded designs after an unsuccessful attempt in the early 1990s to develop a high-end SPARC when the market for such designs was limited. After several government oversight committee hearings in Washington D.C., the sale was permitted to proceed. Under Fujitsu, the existing Board of Directors was replaced with its own members with the exception of Dr. Ross, who was named chairman.\n\nThe company was taken public by Robertson, Stephens & Company on 7 November 1995, but Fujitsu kept a controlling interest in the company and continued to control the Board of Directors. Sun Microsystems also took a 10% interest in the company and was allowed to name a director as well.\n\nIn February 1996, Ross Technology formed Ross Microcomputer in Sonoma, California to produce workstations and servers for value-added resellers (VARs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Their first product, the hyperStation, was known since the division's creation and was introduced in June 1996. The systems used hyperSPARC microprocessors.\n\nIn 1995, Sun Microsystems introduced the 64-bit UltraSPARC microprocessor. As Sun was the dominant SPARC vendor, the majority of the market followed and began the migration to 64-bit SPARC. As a result, the 32-bit SPARC market began to decline.\n\nRoss did not have a 64-bit SPARC microprocessor and was at a disadvantage as a result. Combined with the creation of Ross Microcomputer earlier in the year, which incurred restructuring and other costs, they began to lose money. An effort to regain the company's competitiveness was active at the time, and it involved developing a new 64-bit microprocessor code-named \"Viper\". Fujitsu provided the initial funding for the project, and also agreed to provide Ross Technology with a loan so it could continue operating.\n\nThe company's stock fell during this period, and there were several warnings from NASDAQ in 1997 that the company would be delisted, which Ross avoided until 1998, when the company's stock fell below NASDAQ requirements.\n\nIn April 1998, the company began to consider its financial options, including a search for a buyer. In May, the company warned that a closing of operations was coming and in June 1998, the board of directors decided to begin closing down the company after there were no buyers. A new business unit called BridgePoint was formed at this time to manage the existing inventory, to meet the requirements of existing customers and to provide support for Ross products. Ross Technology closed down in 1998 and all its assets and patents became the property of Fujitsu Ltd.\n\nRoss was a significant part of the hardware ecosystem of Sun's SPARC-based systems of the time. They participated in the design of the MBus architecture, and it was Ross Technology's 605-based Pinnacle product line that launched Sun servers into the 2x and 4x multi-processor arena which prior to Ross were confined to single processor server offerings.\n\nThe \"hyperSPARC\" processor developed by Ross, viewed first as a competitor to Sun's own SPARC processor designs, but eventually adopted by Sun and sold both as upgrades and system components. It was an emergency engineering-wide Ross hyperSPARC upgrade which enabled Steve Jobs' Pixar to complete and deliver their animated movie \"Toy Story\" to Disney on schedule after the existing Sun Microsystems machines were overwhelmed in the late product development stage by Pixar's demanding new technology.\n", "id": "7716644", "categories": ["Fabless semiconductor companies", "Companies disestablished in 1998", "Computer companies established in 1988"], "title": "Ross Technology"}

His family first moved to Louisiana and then to Columbus, Ohio. As the eldest child, he cared for his younger siblings. He moved to Florida after high school. Sancho resides in northeastern Leon County 2 miles west of Lake Miccosukee.\n\nSancho received his A.A. degree from Valencia Community College in 1973. He then received his B.A. in Social Science from Stetson University in 1978. Sancho completed his education with a J.D. from Florida State University College of Law in 1987.\n\nIn 1984 Sancho, a Democrat, was the Leon County leader for Presidential candidate Gary Hart. Sancho is a State Certified Supervisor of Elections and nationally certified by the Elections Center as a Certified Elections/Registration Administrator (CERA). He's a former staff member of the Florida House of Representatives, Corrections, Probation & Parole Committee. He is a member of the Center for Policy Alternatives, Voter Participation Advisory Board and member of The Elections Center.\n\nAfter a bid as county commissioner in 1986 Sancho took courses in election machine management and became certified in their use. In November 1988, Sancho was elected to his first term as the Supervisor of Elections for Leon County, Florida. He ran and was re-elected in 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004, serving his fifth term as of January 2, 2005. He was unopposed in each election since 1992.\n\nIn the 2000 presidential recount, Sancho (No Party Affiliation) was chosen to lead the Florida hand count of ballots in dispute in Miami-Dade County. The U.S. Supreme Court stopped the hand count in a 7-2 vote just as it got underway. Later the Court ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by a December 12 \"safe harbor\" deadline.\n\n\"(Most voters (99%) in Leon County use the opti-scan equipment, but federal law requires one electronic machine per precinct for visually impaired voters).\"\n\nIn 2005, Sancho invited Bev Harris, founder of Black Box Voting, Kathleen Wynne, Black Box Voting Associate Director, Harri Hursti, computer programmer and security expert, Dr. Hugh Thompson, application security expert and Ph.D. in math, Susan Bernecker, former Republican candidate for New Orleans city council and Susan Pynchon, Director of Florida Fair Elections Coalition to Tallahassee. There, they performed what is now known as the Hursti Hack which became the center piece of an HBO documentary titled Hacking Democracy.\nAs a result, Diebold, Election Systems & Software and Sequoia Voting Systems, the only 3 companies certified to do business in Florida would not sell Sancho voting machines. Automark was contacted by Sancho but the Secretary of State would not certify their voting equipment. ES&S said, \"did not believe it could have a smooth working relationship with Sancho\".\n\nIn Florida, Volusia County joined Leon County in dumping Diebold. Elections officials in the states of Maryland, North Carolina, Texas, and California have called into question the security and accuracy of new voting machines.\n\nAfter the test election, Secretary of State Sue Cobb (R) accused Sancho of \"undermining voter confidence\" and the Federal Government and demanded the return of a $564,000 in grant money given to Sancho through the state to purchase voting machines that would comply with ADA standards as mandated in the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), a United States federal law passed on October 29, 2002.\n\nAt Leon County Commission meetings on February 14 and February 28, 2006 the only two Republicans in the local governments of either the city of Tallahassee or Leon County government, Tony Grippa and Ed Depuy of Leon County's seven-member county commission blasted Sancho for failing to provide Leon County with accessible voting machines in attacks that Sancho believes were politically motivated.\n\nAt a Leon County Commission meeting on February 28, 2006, county staff revealed that Chuck Owen, Division Counsel for Diebold Election Systems, met with county staff behind closed doors on February 27. According to staff, Owen stated that Diebold would sell its touch-screen voting machines to the county if, and only if, the county removed Supervisor Sancho from office. That same day, Commissioner DePuy offered a motion, seconded by Commissioner Grippa to request the State Attorney to convene a grand jury to investigate why Leon County is not in compliance with the voting regulations.\n\nTony Grippa left the Leon County Commission in April 2006. Ed DePuy was defeated in 2008 by Democrat Akin Akinyemi.\n\nOn March 8, 2006 Sancho initiated legal proceedings against Diebold Election Systems for breach of contract. Attorney Lida Rodriguez Taseff with Duane Morris in Miami filed the suit. Diebold refused to return phone calls to Sancho and staff, refused to honor its existing contract with Leon County for the maintenance and upgrades of its voting system. Further, Diebold refused to sell Leon County touch-screen voting machines to meet state and federal requirements for disabled accessibility.\n\nSancho has been on National Public Radio and is familiar to readers of the \"New York Times\", the \"Washington Post\", \"St. Petersburg Times\" and appears in the 2006 HBO documentary \"Hacking Democracy.\"\n\n", "id": "7716663", "categories": ["Florida State University College of Law alumni", "1950 births", "Leon County, Florida", "County officials in Florida", "Florida local politicians", "People from Tallahassee, Florida"], "title": "Ion Sancho"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716778", "text": "Metronomy\n\nMetronomy is an English electronic music group formed in 1999. The current band consists of Joseph Mount (vocals, keyboards and guitar), Oscar Cash (saxophone, backing vocals, guitars and keyboards), Anna Prior (drums and vocals), Olugbenga Adelekan (bass guitar and vocals) and Michael Lovett (keyboards and guitars). Their music consists of vocal and instrumental electronic pop music. Mount also releases remixes under the name Metronomy, and has remixed many artists including Gorillaz, Sebastien Tellier, Roots Manuva, Franz Ferdinand, Klaxons, Goldfrapp, Young Knives, Zero 7, Ladytron, Kate Nash, Lady Gaga and Lykke Li.\n\nMetronomy have released five albums of original material, \"Pip Paine (Pay The £5000 You Owe)\", \"Nights Out\", \"The English Riviera\", \"Love Letters\" and \"Summer 08\".\n\nAs a teenager, Joseph Mount began Metronomy as a bedroom project while he was still living with his parents in Devon. After having an interest in music from an early age, he \"drummed in a few bands at school and they all fell apart. Then I got an old computer off my dad I and started messing around when I was about sixteen or seventeen\". The name Metronomy was originally chosen by Mount as the name sounded cool and interesting and was in keeping with the bands he was heavily into, namely Autechre and Funkstorung. The word 'Metronomy' is also linked to a metronome, which is a piece of equipment musicians use to help keep and set tempo.\n\nIn 2002, Mount moved to Brighton for his studies, while having a number of odd jobs, including one at a local HMV. Upon graduating, he became interested in music production and began \"soundtracking animations\". During his time in Brighton, Mount began to get involved with electronic music nights and performed as a DJ. At one of these gigs he was approached by \"some guy, [who] told me he’d put out a record. It turned out that of the songs I’d recorded, I had an album’s worth\".\n\nIn the autumn of 2005, Metronomy released a debut album, \"Pip Paine (Pay the £5000 You Owe) \"preceded by the first single 'You Could Easily Have Me'. After it had received limited attention, Mount began to build up a reputation for live shows. Initially, Metronomy was essentially a laptop/DJ act, although Mount soon asked his cousin Oscar Cash and an old schoolfriend Gabriel Stebbing to join him. Mount explained that \"I was doing some shows on my own (...), which was pretty crap, so I thought it would be better to get a band thing going on\".\n\nOver the next three years, the trio spent gaining live-experience while Mount recreated mixes for many other artists, as contractual issues with the record company halted any new release. On remixing, Mount has said \"(b)asically, I only like remixers that really care about what they're doing. I can honestly say that I have got really involved in all of my remixes. If I’ve not got anywhere with one I will tell whoever it is that I’m giving up. That doesn't happen that often.\" Metronomy has \"a good strike rate\" in terms of remix work released. However, a DFA-inspired remix of U2's \"City of Blinding Lights\" was dismissed by their marketing manager and was not released.\n\nAlthough the band was now a three-piece live, in the studio Mount was \"still writing and recording it all on my own\" and \"influenced by people who’ve written, recorded and produced things all on their own, like Prince\". In 2008, the band released the singles \"My Heart Rate Rapid\", \"Holiday\", \"Heartbreaker\" (which feat. a Remix by Kris Menace), \"A Thing For Me\" and \"Radio Ladio\" and the full album \"Nights Out\" in September of that year. Kris Menace's Remix of \"Heartbreaker\" became Hype Chart Nr.1 in 2008. In May 2009, it was announced through the band's Myspace page that Stebbing would be leaving the band. Joseph wrote \"It's all very amicable and he's assured me he doesn't think he's fleeing a sinking ship.\"\nStebbing is currently working with his own band, Your Twenties, which is being produced by Mount. Despite this, Stebbing reappeared to play bass for Metronomy for their appearance at the Far Out stage at Green Man 2010.\n\nIn 2011, the band released three singles 'The Look', 'Everything Goes My Way' and 'The Bay' from their 3rd album \"The English Riviera\" which came out on 11 April.\n\nOn 23 January 2014, Metronomy's upcoming single \"Love Letters\" was named Zane Lowe's \"Hottest Record in the World\". In a telephone interview with the band, it was confirmed that the video would be directed by Michel Gondry. Their fourth studio album, \"Love Letters\", was released on 10 March 2014, with the band achieving their highest ever position on the UK Albums Chart, at number 7.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Crack\" magazine, it was revealed that Metronomy would be releasing a new album in the summer of 2016. The title of the album was later revealed to be \"Summer 08\", with its release scheduled on 1 July 2016.\n\nBefore Mount started writing music as Metronomy he, Gabriel and friend Kevin Hawes, who died in 2005, performed and wrote music as part of The Upsides and The Customers.\n\nThe Upsides were a band that Joseph and Gabriel joined when still in their early teens. According to Joseph they \"played proper original pop songs - we like to think we were the original Busted\". The band came to an end when both guys moved to Brighton to start university.\n\nThe Customers started out in 1996 as a studio project for Will and Gregg who lived in a neighbouring village to Joseph's and Gabriel's home in Devon, but did not enter its present form until all members had moved from Devon to Sussex.\n\nWill worked with Gabriel and played out live under the guise of Willis. The name changed to The Customers on Christmas Day 2001. Joseph joined the band as drummer in 2002 and they welcomed Gregg back into the line-up to complete the four piece.\n\nMetronomy have toured widely throughout the UK and Europe supporting acts such as Coldplay, Bloc Party, CSS, Klaxons, Kate Nash and Justice. They engaged in their first headline UK tour in 2008. Metronomy have also played gigs in America and Canada notably at the 2007 SXSW.\n\nUp until April 2009 Joseph Mount's performance of keyboards, vocals, and guitar in the live band was accompanied by members Oscar Cash (keyboards, melodica and saxophone), and Gabriel Stebbing (keyboards and bass guitar). Since Stebbing's departure from Metronomy in 2009 their live set has been known as Metronomy 2.0 and has been highly praised by Stebbing.\n\nMetronomy's new band features former Lightspeed Champion drummer Anna Prior and bassist Olugbenga Adelekan.\n\nMetronomy's live shows include dance routines and light shows. Most notably they use push lights stuck to their chests. Mount explained: \"We did our first gig in Brighton, and a few days before I saw these lights in a pound shop and I thought ‘we’ll whack these on our t-shirts and do some synchronised light shows!’ I’m totally aware that some people hate it but equally I think some people enjoy it just for the fact that it’s a bit of fun.\"\n\nMetronomy performed at Field Day music festival in Sydney, Australia on New Years Day 2012 and toured the UK in February 2012 with Two Door Cinema Club, Tribes and Azealia Banks on the NME Awards Tour 2012. They also performed at Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona in May 2014, at Rock Werchter in Belgium in June 2014 and at Festival No.6 at Portmeirion, Wales in September 2015.\n\n\nAntville Music Video Awards\n\nD&AD Awards\nMercury Prize\n\nNME Awards\n\nRober Awards Music Poll\n\nUK Music Video Awards\n\n", "id": "7716778", "categories": ["English electronic music groups"], "title": "Metronomy"}

For most of its existence the company was headquartered at Miami International Airport, Florida. At its height, National Airlines had a network of \"Coast-to-Coast-to-Coast\" flights, linking Florida and the Gulf Coast with cities along the East Coast and large cities on the West Coast. From 1970 to 1978, National, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) and Trans World Airlines (TWA) were the only U.S. airlines that operated scheduled passenger flights to Europe.\n\nNational Airlines was founded by George T. Baker (1899-1963) in 1934. Its headquarters were in St. Petersburg, Florida and it was based at the city's Albert Whitted Airport. On October 15 of that year, revenue flights were launched, transporting passengers and mail from St. Petersburg to a few destinations within Florida using a fleet of two Ryan ST monoplanes. In 1935, the Stinson Trimotor was introduced with National Airlines, which were soon replaced by the Lockheed Model 10 Electra. In 1939, the company headquarters were moved to Jacksonville. By the end of the decade, the National Airlines network spanned from Miami to New Orleans, on what it called the \"Buccaneer Route\".\n\nRevenue passenger miles for years ending June 30:\n\nIn 1940 the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar became the backbone of National's fleet. National was awarded rights from Florida to New York City and other cities along the East Coast in 1944, with flights starting in 1945. In 1946 National got approval to fly to Havana, Cuba, which coincided with the introduction of the Douglas DC-4. The DC-4 allowed non-stop flights between Miami and New York that started on February 14, 1946. Later that year National relocated its headquarters to Miami International Airport; a maintenance base opened at Miami in 1950.\n\nThe Douglas DC-6, National's first pressurized airliner, began flights on July 1, 1947 and reduced New York to Miami flight time from five to four hours. Flights on the DC-6 were marketed as \"Star Service\". National ran the \"Piggy Bank Vacations\" campaign, promoting low-fare flights to Florida during the off-peak summer season.\n\nThis decade saw the introduction of the Convair 340/440, the Douglas DC-7, and the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation. On December 10, 1958 National became the first airline to operate domestic jet flights, using a Boeing 707 leased from Pan American World Airways between Miami and New York. In 1959 the Lockheed L-188 Electra was introduced into the fleet. It was the only turboprop aircraft type ever operated by the airline. At the end of the decade Houston and Boston were the ends of the network with heavy emphasis on service between Florida and the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast.\n\nWith the award of traffic rights on the southern transcontinental route on March 11, 1961, National Airlines gained access to California and began operating new Douglas DC-8 jetliners between Florida and Los Angeles and San Francisco with a number of flights making intermediate stops in Houston and/or New Orleans (previously, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and National had together operated Douglas DC-6 and DC-7 propliner aircraft with interchange through-service between Miami and California). In March 1962, National was operating only one round trip transcontinental nonstop service: National flight numbers 34 and 35 between Miami and Los Angeles which were both flown with DC-8 jets. According to the front cover of its system timetable at the time, National billed itself as the \"Airline of the Stars\". Concerning international destinations in Central and South America, a cooperation involving interchange flights with Pan Am was set up.\n\nAlso during the early 1960s, National inaugurated new service with the Lockheed Electra propjet to Las Vegas and San Diego. Eastbound coast to coast routes flown with the Electra at this time included San Diego-Los Angeles-Houston-New Orleans-Miami and San Francisco-Las Vegas-Houston-New Orleans-Tampa-Orlando-Jacksonville. National was also operating other long, multistop routings with the Electra as this time such as Boston-New York City-Jacksonville-Orlando-Tampa-New Orleans-Houston-Las Vegas-San Francisco. National flight number 223 departed Boston at 7:30am and arrived in San Francisco at 8:42pm with this latter routing being flown on a daily basis. Total travel time for this flight was 16 hours and 12 minutes.\n\nIn 1962 Louis Bergman \"Bud\" Maytag, Jr. (grandson of Maytag Corporation founder Frederick Louis Maytag I), who had previously led Frontier Airlines bought a majority share in National Airlines and replaced George T. Baker as CEO. In 1960, the airline modernized its fleet with new Douglas DC-8 jetliners which were then followed by ten new Boeing 727-100 trijets, the first of which was delivered in 1964.\n\nAfter the retirement of the Electras in 1968, National became an all-jet airline with the DC-8 and 727. The airline introduced the first jet service into Key West, FL in 1968 with the Boeing 727-100. The Douglas DC-8 fleet included the stretched Super DC-8-61 which was the largest aircraft type operated by the airline until the introduction of new wide body jetliners such as the Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10. In 1969, National was operating the Super DC-8 nonstop between Miami and New York JFK airport and also nonstop between Miami and Los Angeles with these flights having specific names such as \"The Royal Biscayne\", \"The Royal Dolphin\", \"The Gotham\" and \"The Manhattan\" between Miami and New York, and \"The Californian\" and \"The Caribbean\" between Miami and Los Angeles.\n\nOn July 26, 1969 the Atlanta-San Francisco nonstop route was awarded to National and service began on October 1, 1969. It was National's only route out of Atlanta.\n\nA $17 million IBM electronic computer reservation system, called Res-A-Vision, was completed and put into operation in 1970.\n\nOn June 16, 1970 National Airlines reintroduced international flights, when their Miami-London route opened (flights to Cuba were suspended in 1961 due to the Cuban Revolution). With the London route, they became the third U.S. transatlantic passenger carrier, after Pan Am and TWA.\n\nIn October, the Boeing 747-100 jumbo jet, at that time the largest commercial airliner, entered service with National on the Miami-New York nonstop route on October 1, 1970 and the Miami-Los Angeles transcontinental nonstop route on October 25, 1970. National sold its 747s in May 1976. Also in 1970, National Airlines opened their own terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport, which was dubbed the \"Sundrome\".\n\nHaving placed an order for ten aircraft back in 1969, the wide body McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 was put in service on the Miami-New York route on December 15, 1971. A 1971 publicity campaign designed by F. William Free promoting National's flight attendants was criticized by the National Organization for Women as being sexist due to the slogan \"I'm (flight attendant's name). Fly me.\", or similar. Seeing one of these posters in Manchester inspired Eric Stewart of 10cc to write the band's 1976 hit song \"I'm Mandy Fly Me\".\n\nIn May 1973, the front cover of the airline's system timetable proudly proclaimed, \"National has daily nonstop 747s from Miami to London\". By early 1976, the airline was operating scheduled wide body DC-10 service to Houston (IAH), Las Vegas (LAS), Los Angeles (LAX), Miami (MIA), New Orleans (MSY), Orlando (MCO), San Diego (SAN), San Francisco (SFO), Tampa (TPA), West Palm Beach (PBI) and all three airports in the New York City area: John F. Kennedy (JFK), LaGuardia (LGA) and Newark (EWR). With the advent of the intercontinental McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, National Airlines then expanded their European network by adding Paris (inaugurated on June 22, 1977), as well as Frankfurt, Amsterdam (both in 1978) and Zurich (in 1979). National began the very first nonstop flights from New Orleans to Europe (to Amsterdam) on July 2, 1978. National then began nonstop New York Kennedy (JFK)-Amsterdam flights on December 13, 1978, taking the route over from Pan Am.\n\nIn 1975, National was forced to shut down for several months due to a strike by flight attendants.\n\nIn the late 1970s, several airlines tried to take over National Airlines, who had become a major player in the southern transcontinental and Florida-East Coast airline markets. In 1978, Texas International Airlines (which was led by Frank Lorenzo at that time) acquired 24.6 percent of the shares, but did not succeed in the subsequent tender offer takeover bid. A similar attempt was made by Eastern Air Lines in 1979. At the same time, the shares held by Texas International were sold to Pan American World Airways, who emerged as a white knight and succeeded in accumulating a controlling majority.\n\nOn January 7, 1980, the acquisition of National was completed, with Pan Am taking over the National Airlines fleet and route network. Pan Am continued to utilize the former National Miami maintenance base and headquarters building until Pan Am itself ceased operations in December 1991. Much later, National's \"Sun King\" logo was sold and \"repackaged\" much like Pan Am's to appear upon the branding of start up \"low cost carrier\" Southeast Airlines aircraft.\n\nMost industry analysts believe that Pan Am paid too high a price for National, and was ill-prepared to integrate National's domestic route network with Pan Am's own globe-girdling international network. The cultures of National and Pan Am also proved to be incompatible, making workforce integration difficult. Texas International walked away from their foiled attempt with a multi-million dollar stock profit and was poised for Lorenzo's next ventures—a startup airline in the high-density East coast corridor (New York Air), and subsequent acquisition of Continental Airlines.\n\nNational Airlines operated scheduled flights to the following U.S. cities:\nNational also operated scheduled flights to the following destinations in Europe and the Caribbean:\n\nWhen National Airlines was acquired by Pan Am in 1980, the fleet consisted of 43 Boeing 727 aircraft (19 of the original series 100 model and 24 of the stretched series 200 variant), as well as 16 McDonnell Douglas DC-10 airliners (11 of the series 10 model used in domestic service and five of the intercontinental series 30 model used for service to Europe).\n\nOver the years, National owned the following aircraft types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 1961 and 1980, 22 (attempted) hijackings on board National Airlines occurred, which involved the aircraft being demanded to be flown to Cuba. In 1969 alone, there were nine such occurrences. These events can be partly attributed to the tense Cuba–United States relations at that time, and the many flights of National Airlines in and to the southeastern United States, near Cuba. See List of Cuba – United States aircraft hijackings for more information.\n\nThere were several other criminal acts involving National Airlines aircraft:\n\n", "id": "7716791", "categories": ["Defunct companies based in Florida", "Pan Am", "Defunct airlines of the United States", "National Airlines", "Airlines disestablished in 1980", "Companies based in Miami-Dade County, Florida", "Airlines established in 1934", "1934 establishments in Florida", "1980 mergers and acquisitions"], "title": "National Airlines (1934–1980)"}

IPMCs are composed of an ionic polymer like Nafion or Flemion whose surfaces are chemically plated or physically coated with conductors such as platinum or gold. Under an applied voltage (1–5 V for typical 10mmx40mmx0.2mm samples), ion migration and redistribution due to the imposed voltage across a strip of IPMCs result in a bending deformation. If the plated electrodes are arranged in a non-symmetric configuration, the imposed voltage can induce all kinds of deformations such as twisting, rolling, torsioning, turning,twirling, whirling and non-symmetric bending deformation. Alternatively, if such deformations are physically applied to an IPMC strips they generate an output voltage signal (few millivolts for typical small samples) as sensors and energy harvesters. IPMCs are a type of electroactive polymer. They work very well in a liquid environment as well as in air. They have a force density of about 40 in a cantilever configuration, meaning that they can generate a tip force of almost 40 times their own weight in a cantilever mode. IPMCs in actuation,sensing and energy harvesting have a very broad bandwidth to kilo HZ and higher. IPMCs were first introduced in 1998 by Shahinpoor, Bar-Cohen, Xue, Simpson and Smith (see references below) but the original idea of ionic polymer actuators and sensors goes back to 1992-93 by Adolf, Shahinpoor, Segalman, Witkowski, Osada, Okuzaki, Hori, Doi, Matsumoto, Hirose, Oguro, Takenaka, Asaka and Kawami as depicted below:\n\n1-Segalman D.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716808", "text": "HTTP persistent connection\n\nHTTP persistent connection, also called HTTP keep-alive, or HTTP connection reuse, is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair. The newer HTTP/2 protocol uses the same idea and takes it further to allow multiple concurrent requests/responses to be multiplexed over a single connection.\n\nUnder HTTP 1.0, connections are not considered persistent unless a keep-alive header is included, although there is no official specification for how keepalive operates. It was, in essence, added to an existing protocol. If the client supports keep-alive, it adds an additional header to the request:\n\nThen, when the server receives this request and generates a response, it also adds a header to the response:\n\nFollowing this, the connection is not dropped, but is instead kept open. When the client sends another request, it uses the same connection. This will continue until either the client or the server decides that the conversation is over, and one of them drops the connection.\n\nIn HTTP 1.1, all connections are considered persistent unless declared otherwise. The HTTP persistent connections do not use separate keepalive messages, they just allow multiple requests to use a single connection. However, the default connection timeout of Apache httpd 1.3 and 2.0 is as little as 15 seconds and just 5 seconds for Apache httpd 2.2 and above. The advantage of a short timeout is the ability to deliver multiple components of a web page quickly while not consuming resources to run multiple server processes or threads for too long.\n\nKeepalive makes it difficult for the client to determine where one response ends and the next response begins, particularly during pipelined HTTP operation. This is a serious problem when codice_1 cannot be used due to streaming. To solve this problem, HTTP 1.1 introduced a chunked transfer coding that defines a codice_2 bit. The codice_2 bit is set at the end of each response so that the client knows where the next response begins.\n\n\nAccording to RFC 7230, section 6.4, \"a client ought to limit the number of simultaneous open connections that it maintains to a given server\". The previous version of the HTTP/1.1 specification stated specific maximum values but in the words of RFC 7230 \"this was found to be impractical for many applications... instead... be conservative when opening multiple connections\". These guidelines are intended to improve HTTP response times and avoid congestion. If HTTP pipelining is correctly implemented, there is no performance benefit to be gained from additional connections, while additional connections may cause issues with congestion.\n\nIf the client does not close the connection when all of the data it needs has been received, the resources needed to keep the connection open on the server will be unavailable for other clients. How much this affects the server's availability and how long the resources are unavailable depend on the server's architecture and configuration.\n\nAll modern web browsers including Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer (since 4.01), Opera (since 4.0) and Safari use persistent connections.\n\nBy default, Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7 use two persistent connections while version 8 uses six. Persistent connections time out after 60 seconds of inactivity which is changeable via the Windows Registry.\n\nIn Firefox, the number of simultaneous connections can be customized (per-server, per-proxy, total). Persistent connections time out after 115 seconds (1.92 minutes) of inactivity which is changeable via the configuration.\n\n\n", "id": "7716808", "categories": [], "title": "HTTP persistent connection"}

National offered service to a limited number of cities with high traffic to Las Vegas. The airline operated a fleet of 19 Boeing 757-200s in a two-class configuration.\n\nHoping to attract more visitors from the East Coast, Harrah's Entertainment and the former Rio Hotel & Casino, Inc., each contributed $15 million toward the start-up costs of National Airlines in July 1998.

BorderManager is designed as a proxy server, firewall, and VPN access point. Novell has announced that migration to SuperLumin 4.0 Proxy Cache is \"Novell's preferred firewall and proxy solution for NetWare customers upgrading to Novell Open Enterprise Server on Linux.\"\n\nBorderManager was designed to run on top of the NetWare kernel and takes advantage of the fast file services that the NetWare kernel delivers. Aside from the more easily copied firewall and VPN access point services, Novell designed the proxy services to retrieve web data with a server to server connection rather than a client to server connection as all of the prior proxy servers on the market had done. This retrieval method along with NetWare's fast file IO and other proprietary code made BorderManager's proxy engine one of the fastest in existence.\n\nIn 2003, Novell announced the successor product to NetWare: Open Enterprise Server (OES). First released in March 2005, OES completes the separation of the services traditionally associated with NetWare, i.e. file and print. This makes it possible for the customer to choose which NetWare or Linux kernel the services will run on.\n\nAt this time Novell all but announced the end of development for the NetWare kernel (numerous public and private statements that there is no 64-bit future for NetWare and that Linux is the path to 64-bit computing for OES). To follow through on this migration path, Novell began porting all applications to Linux. The company began looking at alternate ways to deliver these same services, as firewall and VPN access point services of equivalent functionality are readily available in the free/open-source community and there are also basic proxy services as well (i.e. Squid). The desire to deliver a functional equivalent could not be done by a full software code port as much of the cache engine was sold as part of the Volera Excelerator and Novell holds a great desire to use or create open-source software for basic services such as this.\n\nNovell entered an agreement with Astaro to relabel Astaro Security Gateway and license it as Novell Security Manager. The product was removed from the Novell price list on 15 February 2007.\n\nIn the late summer of 2006 Novell announced, that there would be a BorderManager 3.9 release.\n\nAt the Novell BrainShare conference in 2010, Novell announced \"SuperLumin 4.0 Proxy Cache as path forward for BorderManager customers.\" They also announced \"extended BorderManager General Support for two years (through March 7, 2012)\" to give customers \"adequate time to make the move.\"\n\nAs of November 2011, the Novell Support Lifecycle page states that \"Border Manager 3.9 General Support will be extended to September 30, 2013, to make it easy for customers to plan and execute their upgrade to Novell Open Enterprise Server. The upgrade path for Border Manager remains SuperLumin Nemesis.\"\n\nThird-party filtering solutions are available for Novell BorderManager, from the following companies:\n\n\n", "id": "7716826", "categories": ["1997 software", "Firewall software"], "title": "Novell BorderManager"}

In the 2002 census 35,642 citizens of Slovenia identified themselves as Croats.\n\nCroats have lived in the Slovene Lands for centuries. Most Croats and Slovenes were for centuries part of the same political entities, first the Habsburg Empire and then Yugoslavia. The number of Croats in the territory of modern Slovenia remained relatively small, as the Slovene lands before the 1950s experienced more emigration than immigration. During most of the history, Croats did not constitute a separate community, and many were assimilated by the Slovene, German or Venetian-speaking populations. After World War I, the number of Croats in Slovenia increased significantly, and more numerous communities were present in Ljubljana, Maribor and Celje. In the 1960s, the number of Croats increased significantly again as the result of a wave of relocation from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nUnlike two other historic autochthonous minorities of Slovenia, the Hungarians and Italians, the Croats have not been granted minority status, although they are the second largest ethnic minority in Slovenia, after the Serbs (also not granted minority status). According to the Slovenian constitutional framework, only \"historical minorities who have been living on clearly defined territories for centuries (and the Romani people, who have formed a distinct community since at least the 13th century can have the status of a minority\". This would carry several constitutionally guaranteed rights, such as visible bilingualism and an autonomous educational system. All remaining minority members are guaranteed the right to express and develop freely their cultural and linguistic heritage, under the same laws applying to citizens in general, but lack the positive discrimination policies applied to the three constitutionally recognized minority communities, as well as the right to have state-sponsored schools in their languages.\n\nIn 2006, the Croatian Heritage Foundation along with the Federation of Croatian Societies of Slovenia organized the Week of Slovenian Croats in Zagreb as part of the heritage foundation's annual Croatian minority week.\n\nThe number of Slovenian citizens of Croatian origin is difficult to establish. According to the 2001 census, 35,642 of them declared themselves as ethnically (\"nationally\", according to the Slovenian terminology) Croatian. In the same census, around 54,000 people declared Croatian as their mother tongue. Ten years earlier, more than 52,000 Slovenian citizens declared themselves as ethnically Croatian, while the number of those with Croatian as their mother tongue was around 50,000.\n\nIt seems however that the great majority of Croats living in Slovenia uses Slovene as their primary language of communication.\nIn 2001, only around 2,700 people spoke either Croatian or a combination of Croatian and Slovene at home, which is a significant decrease from in 1991, when their number was around 10,000.\n\nNumber of self-declared ethnic Croats in Slovenia after World War II:\n\n\nSlovenians of Croat ethnic origin include:\n\n\n", "id": "7716870", "categories": ["Ethnic groups in Slovenia", "Croatian diaspora by country"], "title": "Croats of Slovenia"}

Originally called Express Australia, the organisation is currently listed on the Register of Cultural Organisations. It presents an annual program of special events, workshops, awards and artistic projects throughout the year, to generate opportunities for young and emerging artists. The flagship publication is \"Voiceworks\". In 2005, John Marsden (writer) became, and remains, the principal patron of Express Media supporting an annual prize encouraging creative literary work by young people. \n\nIn 1988 Express Media began publishing a newsletter, both to promote the organisation’s program of workshops and as a forum for youth and media issues. The newsletter was called Voiceworks and it was launched by then Prime Minister Bob Hawke and music journalist Ian “Molly” Meldrum. In the ‘90s, Voiceworks grew into a quarterly magazine, expanding its content to include poetry, short fiction, articles, opinion and illustration contributed by under 25s. Prominent alumni such as Benjamin Law, Liam Pieper, Anna Krien, Hannah Kent, Tom Doig, Lili Wilkinson, Justin Heazlewood and Van Badham have gone on to have a significant impact in the Australian literary, artistic and political landscapes. The magazine has remained in print form and has continued to develop into a well-respected and sophisticated literary journal. In 2015, Voiceworks celebrated its 100th issue.\n\nIn response to the need for development opportunities and professional pathways for arts and cultural critics, 1997 saw the launch of Express Media’s Buzzcuts program. In partnership with literary and arts festivals around the country, the program was developed in order to give young journalists experience working with an editor, publication opportunities and exposure to the world of professional arts reviewing and cultural criticism.\n\nFollowing the success of Express Media’s Make It Up Zine Fair and in response to the burgeoning youth and emerging literary scene in Melbourne, in 2004 Express Media held a two-day series of panels, readings, performances and workshops featuring ‘the best Australian writers you haven’t heard of yet’. This event was the inaugural Emerging Writers’ Festival. While the festival found a strong audience and independence, the two organisations continue to have strong ties and Express Media alumni as well as young writers engaged in our programs feature heavily within the festival each year.\n\nIn 2005, John Marsden became, and remains, the principal patron of Express Media supporting an annual prize encouraging creative literary work by young people. The patronage of an immensely popular and internationally recognised author has been invaluable in assisting Express Media to encourage and develop the creative skills of young writers, by significantly extending the reach and impact of our programs.\n\nIn 2010, Express Media became a resident organisation of The Wheeler Centre, as part of Melbourne’s UNESCO designation as a City of Literature.\n\nSince that time, Express Media has nurtured countless innovative new projects and lead initiatives including the Write In Your Face Grants, The Young Writers Innovation Prize, The New Voices Poetry Series, The Under Age, The Signal Express, The Global Express and Dialect, Hologram, Buzzcuts as well as continuing to produce their flagship publication, Voiceworks. \n\nWhile Express Media's annual program changes in order to meet the developing needs of young Australian writers and voices, as of 2019 Express Media's programs are: \n\n", "id": "7716998", "categories": ["Culture of Melbourne", "1983 establishments in Australia", "Youth-led media"], "title": "Express Media"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7717002", "text": "Culbert\n\nCulbert is a personal name that seems to have originated in Europe. The earliest records for this surname are found in England, Scotland, and Ireland. The use of surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England, heritable surnames started to form in the 11th century, and were common in most areas by 1400. The Poll Tax introduced in England in the 14th Century (considered a head tax) is probably the first time this common usage of surnames was documented.\nA specific origin for this name is not known, however it does not appear to be derived from a place, nor from an occupation, two common sources for peoples' names.\n\nThe following references suggest that Culbert may be derived from other names that describe a person's character. For example, Culbert may stem from \"Culbheart,\" which is a Gaelic form meaning \"crafty\". However, Culbert is not a Gaelic name, and connecting the Culberts to early Ireland has been unsuccessful, as no records have been found before the 18th Century, with the earliest found being from 1749. It is possible the earliest Culberts in Ireland came there from Scotland and England as a result of the creation of the Plantations of Ulster in the early 1600s.\n\nAlso, crafty is related to \"wisdom,\" and this suggests a possible connection with the surname Cuthbert, a name from the Anglo Saxon, which means \"famous, bright, of clear skill or knowledge\". It is also believed by some researchers that Culbert is derived from Cutbert. This earlier spelling is very similar to Cuthbert and Cuthbertson, one reason for the close relationship between these surnames. The surname is also closely related to Culbertson and Culberson, which mean son of Culbert.\n\nWith regards to claims of origin, MacLysaght states that the surname Culbert is of Huguenot origin, and is found mainly in Ireland's northern province of Ulster. However, no record has yet been found to document that any Culbert was a Huguenot or a Huguenot descendant.\n\nIn Scotland, Culbert is considered a variant of Colbert, derived from the Anglo-Saxon \"Ceolberht/Ceolbeorht\" (in Old English, \"ceol\" = ship and \"berht/beorht\" = bright). They suggest Culbert is a personal name dating from the 700s in England, however, no actual records have been found in England for another 850 years.\n\nAlso for England, one heraldry-relate website claims that Culbert is one of the names of people who migrated there from Normandy following the Norman Conquest, and that Culbert has been found in the Counties of Cheshire and Lancashire. Unfortunately, these records also have not been uncovered. The earliest Culbert found in FamilySearch records for Cheshire is William Culbert b. bef. 1706, and for Lancashire is Thomas Culbert b. bef. 1764. The oldest Culbert record found to date anywhere is for Mutton Culbert, who married Alice Legge on 27 Mar 1554 at St. Nicholas, Ipswich, Suffolk, England.\n\nThe earliest home of a Culbertson (son of Culbert) so far found is located in the County of Roxburg, Scotland, at a small village named Morebattle, eight miles south of Kelso. Here Culbertson people have reportedly lived continuously since the year 1400 AD. This is in the Lowlands and is about five miles from the Cheviot Hills, which form the boundary between Scotland and England.\n\nAs migrations from Europe became more common in the 19th and 20th Centuries, Culbert people have spread from Europe and have now become more predominant in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. For example, in the 1881 Census of the United Kingdom (including England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland), 91 Culbert individuals were indexed, compared to 256 individuals in the 1881 Canada Census, and compared to 620 individuals in the 1880 U.S. Federal Census.\n\nIn 2000, the surname Culbert was ranked 12,650 in terms of the most common surnames in the United States, with 2,244 occurrences in the 2000 U.S. Federal Census. The racial/ethnic breakdown included nearly 77 percent White, almost 20 percent Black, a little more than 2 percent Hispanic, about 1 percent Non-Hispanic of two or more races, and minor amounts (less than 1 percent) of Asian and Pacific Islander or American Indian and Alaskan Native.\n\nAn extract of an Office of National Statistics database containing a list of surnames in use in England, Wales and the Isle of Mann in September 2002 suggests that Culbert was ranked 13,686, with 389 occurrences.\n\nCulbert is used as both a given name and as a surname, as in the following examples of persons:\n\n\nThe following places and objects carrying the name Culbert have been identified to date.

She is the daughter of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Chrisann Brennan. For several years, Jobs denied paternity, which led to a legal case and various media reports in the early days of Apple. Lisa and Steve Jobs eventually reconciled, and he accepted her paternity. Brennan-Jobs later worked as a journalist and magazine writer.\n\nAn early Apple computer, the Apple Lisa, is named after Brennan-Jobs, and she has been depicted in a number of biographies and films, including the biopics \"Pirates of Silicon Valley\", \"Jobs\", and \"Steve Jobs\". A fictionalized version of her is a major character in her aunt Mona Simpson's novel \"A Regular Guy\".\n\nLisa Nicole Brennan was born on May 17, 1978 on Robert Friedland's All One Farm commune outside of Portland, Oregon. Her mother, Chrisann Brennan, and her father, Steve Jobs, first met at Homestead High School in Cupertino, California in 1972 and had an on-off relationship for the next five years. In 1977, after Jobs had co-founded Apple Inc., he and Brennan moved into a house with their friend Daniel Kottke near the company's office in Cupertino, where they all worked. It was during this period that Brennan became pregnant with Lisa. Jobs, however, did not assume responsibility for the pregnancy, which led Brennan to end the relationship, leave their shared home, and support herself by cleaning houses.\n\nIn 1978, Brennan moved to the All One Farm commune to have the baby. Jobs was not present for the baby's birth and only came up three days later after Robert Friedland, the farm's owner and a friend of Jobs from Reed College, persuaded him to do so. Brennan and Jobs named the baby Lisa. Jobs named the computer project he was working on, the Apple Lisa, after her. Shortly after, Jobs publicly denied that he was the child's father. He claimed that the Apple Lisa was not named for her, and had his team come up with the phrase \"Local Integrated Systems Architecture\" as an alternative explanation for the project's name. Decades later, Jobs admitted that \"obviously, it was named for my daughter\".\n\nAfter Lisa was born, Jobs publicly denied paternity, which led to a legal case. Even after a DNA paternity test established him as her father, he maintained his position. The resolution of the legal case required him to provide Brennan with $385 per month and to reimburse the state for the money she had received from welfare. After Apple went public and Jobs became a multimillionaire, he increased the payment to $500 a month. Michael Moritz interviewed Jobs, Brennan, and a number of others for the 1982 \"Time\" Person of the Year special issue, released on January 3, 1983. In his interview, Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test, which had found that the \"probability of paternity for Jobs, Steven... is 94.1%\". Jobs responded by arguing that \"28% of the male population of the United States could be the father\". Rather than name him \"Person of the Year\", as he and many others expected while giving the interviews, the issue was instead titled \"Machine of the Year: The Computer Moves In\". The thematic change occurred after Moritz heard about Brennan-Jobs as well as Jobs's management style.\n\nYears later, after Jobs left Apple, he acknowledged Lisa and attempted to reconcile with her. Chrisann Brennan wrote that \"he apologized many times over for his behavior\" to her and Lisa and \"said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry\". After reconciling with her, nine-year-old Lisa wanted to change her last name and Jobs was happy and relieved to agree to it. Jobs legally altered her birth certificate, changing her name from Lisa Brennan to Lisa Brennan-Jobs. Brennan credits the change in Jobs to the influence of Brennan-Jobs' newly found biological aunt, author Mona Simpson, who worked to repair the relationship between Brennan-Jobs and her father.\n\nAccording to \"Fortune magazine\", in his will, Jobs left Lisa a multimillion-dollar inheritance.\n\nWhen Brennan-Jobs was living with her mother, she attended The Nueva School and Lick Wilmerding High School. Later, after she moved in with her father, she attended Palo Alto High School. She enrolled at Harvard University in 1996 and studied overseas for one year at King's College London. While a student at Harvard, she wrote for \"The Harvard Crimson.\" She graduated in 2000 and subsequently moved to Manhattan to work as a writer. She has written for \"The Southwest Review\", \"The Massachusetts Review\", \"The Harvard Advocate\", \"Spiked\", \"Vogue\", and \"O, The Oprah Magazine.\"\n\nIn March 2018, Brennan-Jobs announced that she was writing \"Small Fry\", a memoir detailing her childhood and the complex and sometimes difficult relationship she had with her father. The book was published on September 4, 2018.\n\nBrennan-Jobs has been portrayed in several biographies of her father, including Walter Isaacson's 2011 authorized biography \"Steve Jobs\". Mona Simpson's 1996 novel \"A Regular Guy\" is a fictionalized account based on the story of Brennan-Jobs and her parents. She has been depicted in three biopic films: Brooke Radding portrayed her in the 1999 TNT TV film \"Pirates of Silicon Valley\", while she is played as a child by Ava Acres, and as an adult by Annika Bertea, in the 2013 film \"Jobs\". In the 2015 film \"Steve Jobs\", directed by Danny Boyle, Brennan-Jobs is portrayed at different ages by Perla Haney-Jardine, Ripley Sobo, and Makenzie Moss. \"Steve Jobs\" screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said that he discussed the screenplay with Brennan-Jobs in advance and that she is the \"heroine of the film\".\n\nBrennan-Jobs resides in Brooklyn with her husband, Bill, their son, and her two stepdaughters.\n", "id": "7717074", "categories": ["Harvard Crimson alumni", "Nueva School alumni", "Writers from Portland, Oregon", "Alumni of King's College London", "American people of Swiss descent", "1978 births", "American memoirists", "Writers from Palo Alto, California", "American people of German descent", "21st-century American women writers", "Steve Jobs", "Living people", "Writers from Brooklyn", "Palo Alto High School alumni", "Harvard University alumni", "American women essayists", "American writers of Syrian descent"], "title": "Lisa Brennan-Jobs"}

For instance, product design can require modification of sound level or noise for compliance with standards from ANSI, IEC, and ISO. The work might also involve design fine-tuning to meet market expectations. Here, examples include tweaking an automobile door latching mechanism to impress a consumer with a satisfying click or modifying an exhaust manifold to change the tone of an engine's rumble. Aircraft designers are also using acoustic instrumentation to reduce the noise generated on takeoff and landing.\n\nAcoustical measurements and instrumentation range from a handheld sound level meter to a 1000-microphone phased array. \n\nMost of the acoustical measurement and instrumentation systems can be broken down into three components: sensors, data acquisition and analysis.\n\nThe most common sensor used for acoustic measurement is the microphone. Measurement-grade microphones are different from typical recording-studio microphones because they can provide a detailed calibration for their response and sensitivity. Other sensors include hydrophones for measuring sound in water or accelerometers for measuring vibrations causing sound. The three main groups of microphones are pressure, free-field, and random-incidence, each with their own correction factors for different applications. Well-known microphone suppliers include PCB Piezotronics, Brüel & Kjær, GRAS and Audio Precision.\n\nData acquisition hardware for acoustic measurements typically utilizes 24-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), anti-aliasing filters, and other signal conditioning. This signal conditioning may include amplification, filtering, sensor excitation, and input configuration. Another consideration is the frequency range of the instrumentation. It should be large enough to cover the frequency range of signal interest, taking into account the range of the sensor. To prevent aliasing, many devices come with antialiasing filters, which cut the maximum frequency range of the device to a little less than one-half the maximum sampling rate, as prescribed by the Nyquist sampling theorem. Dynamic range is a common way to compare performance from one instrument to another. Dynamic range is a measure of how small you can measure a signal relative to the maximum input signal the device can measure. Expressed in decibels, the dynamic range is 20 log (Vmax/Vmin). For example, a device with an input range of ±10 V and a dynamic range of 110 dB will be able to measure a signal as small as 10 µV. Thus, the input range and the specified dynamic range are important for determining the needs of your instrumentation system.\n\nAudio and acoustic analysis includes: fractional-octave analysis, sound-level measurements, power spectra, frequency response measurements, and transient analysis. Results are viewed on waterfall displays, colormap displays, and octave graphs.\n", "id": "7717088", "categories": [], "title": "Acoustical measurements and instrumentation"}

It is housed by the Rare Book Division of the New York Public Library.\n\nIt is notable as one of only two known instances of a historical map actually using the phrase \"HC SVNT DRACONES\" (in Latin \"hic sunt dracones\" means \"here are dragons\".)\n\nThe Lenox Globe is a hollow copper globe that measures in diameter and in circumference. It is two parts, joined at the equator and held together by a wire strung through holes at the poles.\n\nIt bears a striking resemblance to the Globus Jagellonicus, also tentatively dated to 1510.\n\nThe phrase \"HIC SVNT DRACONES\" appears on the eastern coast of Asia.\n\nThe globe's origins were unknown until 2013. It was purchased in Paris in 1855 by architect Richard Morris Hunt, who gave it to James Lenox, whose collection became part of the New York Public Library, where the globe still resides.\n\nIn his recollections, Henry Stevens recalled seeing the globe while dining with Hunt in 1870. Hunt was ambivalent about the globe, which he bought \"for a song\", and was allowing his children to toy with it. Stevens recognized its value and urged Hunt to store it in the Lenox Library, which he was designing at the time. Stevens also borrowed the globe to ascertain its age with the help of Julius Erasmus Hilgard, who worked for the Coast Survey—a predecessor to the US National Geodetic Survey.\n\nA similar grapefruit-sized globe made from two halves of an ostrich egg was found in 2012 and is believed to date from 1504. It may be the oldest globe to show the New World. Stefaan Missinne, who analyzed the globe for the Washington Map Society journal \"Portolan\", said it was \"part of an important European collection for decades.\" After a year of research in which he consulted many experts, Missinne concluded the Hunt–Lenox Globe was a copper cast of the egg globe.\n\nThe earliest known article on the globe was written by B. F. de Costa for the \"Magazine of American History\" in September 1879. Gabriel Gravier reprinted the article with additional comments in the \"Bulletin de la société normande de géographie\" later that year.\n\nHowever, neither article links \"hic sunt dracones\" to dragons. Da Costa writes:\nIn this region [China, called \"East India\" on the globe], near the equatorial line, is seen \"Hc Svnt Dracones\", or here are the Dagroians, described by Marco Polo as living in the Kingdom of \"Dagroian\". These people... feasted upon the dead and picked their bones (B.II. c.14, Ramusio's ed.)\nIn his translation of Da Costa's article, Gabriel Gravier adds that Marco Polo's Kingdom of Dagroian is in Java Minor, or Sumatra, well away from the spot indicated on the Lenox Globe.\n\nThe flat drawing of the globe which accompanied the early articles is reproduced as map 7 in Emerson D. Fite and Archibald Freeman's \"A Book of Old Maps Delineating American History\" (New York: Dover Reprints, 1969), and as figure 43 in A. E. Nordenskiöld's \"Facsimile-Atlas to the Early History of Cartography\" (New York: Dover Reprints, 1973).\n\nA photograph of the globe itself can be found on page 81 of Ena L. Yonge's \"A Catalogue of Early Globes Made Prior to 1850 and Conserved in the United States\" (New York: American Geographical Society, 1968); however, the side with the inscription faces away from the camera.\n\n", "id": "7717190", "categories": ["Historic maps of the world", "Age of Discovery", "1510s works"], "title": "Hunt–Lenox Globe"}

Recorded for Atlantic Records in New York City in September 1950, and released in October, it was \"Billboard\"s number-one R&B hit for 11 non-consecutive weeks. It was Atlantic's first release on the new 45-rpm record format. The huge hit earned Brown the nickname \"Miss Rhythm\" and within a few months she became the acknowledged queen of R&B. \"Teardrops from My Eyes\" was her first of five number-one R&B hits.\n\nBefore this hit single, Ruth Brown was thought of strictly as a torch singer. When Ruby Toombs showed her the song Brown was initially reluctant to do it as it was so rhythmically different from the popular standards and ballads she was comfortable singing. The change of tempo, the backbeat of four/four, at first led her to dig in her heels. But Ahmet Ertegün, sensing the time was right, urged her to give the song a try and so she went along with his choice of tunes for her. The song featured a tenor solo by Budd Johnson.\n\nAtlantic used a process that it would repeat over the years, that is, turning an uptown singer funky. As with Ruth Brown, Ahmet Ertegün's method was to introduce popular black musical artists to older and more powerful black musical modes.\n\n", "id": "7717207", "categories": ["1950 singles", "Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs number-one singles", "1950 songs", "Songs written by Rudy Toombs", "Louis Jordan songs", "Ruth Brown songs", "Number-one singles in the United States"], "title": "Teardrops from My Eyes"}

They were merchants.\n\nArmenians were deported in large numbers to New Julfa, on the outskirts of Isfahan (Persia), early in the seventeenth century. Many continued on to India and Southeast Asia in the eighteenth century as conditions turned against them in Persia. By the 19th century they were to be found chiefly in Burma, the Malay peninsula (particularly Penang and Malacca), and Java. They tended to emigrate further from around World War I, notably to Australia.\n\nIn Burma, major Armenian traders were employed as officials by the Burmese kings, especially in charge of customs and relations with foreigners. They survived the First Burmese War in 1826, when the British annexed Arakan and Tenasserim, but the British conquest of Lower Burma, the commercial heart of the country, in 1852, led to renewed accusations (from the British) that Armenian merchants were anti-British, and even pro-Russian. Nevertheless, the Armenians of Yangon built their church in 1862, on land presented to them by the King of Burma.\n\nThe 1871-1872 Census of British India revealed that there were 1,250 Armenians, chiefly in Kolkata, Dhaka and Yangon. The 1881 Census stated the figure to be 1,308; 737 in Bengal and 466 in Burma. By 1891, the total figure was 1,295.The 1901 Census of British India stated that there were 256 Armenians in Burma.\n\nThe Armenian Apostolic Church of St. John the Baptist is in Yangon.\n\nThackers Indian Directory lists many Armenian language names in Burmese business and government.

The United States House Committee on Appropriations and the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations have joint jurisdiction over all appropriations bills in the United States Congress. Each committee has 12 matching subcommittees, each of which is tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills.\n\nTraditionally, after a federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year has been passed, the appropriations subcommittees receive information about what the budget sets as their spending ceilings. This is called \"302(b) allocations\" after section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. That amount is separated into smaller amounts for each of the twelve Subcommittees. The federal budget does not become law and is not signed by the President. Instead, it is guide for the House and the Senate in making appropriations and tax decisions. However, no budget is required and each chamber has procedures in place for what to do without one. The House and Senate now consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.\n\nAn appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The \"fiscal year\" is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year.\n\nThere are three types of appropriations bills: regular appropriations bills, continuing resolutions, and supplemental appropriations bills. Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for the federal government for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1. If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time, it can pass a continuing resolution, which continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time. The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills, which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief.\n\nAppropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. Article One of the United States Constitution, section 9, clause 7, states that \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7717312", "categories": [], "title": "United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies"}

Seven of Watertown's main streets (including U.S. Route 11, New York State Route 3, New York State Route 12, and New York State Route 283) intersect at the square, making it a heavy traffic destination for motorists.\n\nWhile the square boasts some modern architecture, its main character is defined by the numerous 19th- and early 20th-century buildings that still stand. Throughout its buildings, the square is host to a multitude of shops, restaurants, business offices, churches and apartment houses, making it a major shopping and business destination in the city.\n\nWatertown's first settlers built their homesteads on what is now the square's West End in 1800. In 1805, several settlers donated land for public use which became the basis of the square. This helped to develop the square as Watertown's main business district. The current layout of the square and its surrounding streets developed in those early years.\nIn 1849, most of Public Square and buildings on three adjacent streets were destroyed by fire. The square was immediately rebuilt. Several buildings erected during the rebuilding still stand. In the rebuilding of the 1850s, the city created three parks at the square's center, with a fountain inside the center park. During Watertown's industrial boom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Public Square became the heart of Watertown's retail, business and social life. In the 1950s, the three parks in the square's center were combined into one large park.\n\nThe square's retail and business dominance started declining in the latter half of the 20th century. Urban renewal policies during the 1960s and 1970s resulted in the demolition of some of the square's historic structures. Declining industry hurt Watertown's once prospering economy. Although nearby the Fort Drum military reservation expanded in the 1980s and brought growth to the Watertown, modern shopping malls and retail chains built on the city's west side drew business away from the square. Public Square's days as the city's main retail destination were at an end. The square continued its slow decline over the next 20 years.\n\nThe beginning of the 21st century saw a reversal in attitudes towards Public Square. With a resurgence of pride in the square and its role in Watertown's history, civic and business leaders have taken a strong role in its redevelopment. Existing buildings were refurbished and new businesses moved in. Some decaying structures beyond repair were demolished. In 2006, the new economic development was coupled with a multimillion-dollar streetscape project to reinforce the square's infrastructure, as well as beautify its roads, walkways and landscaping. This project was completed in November, 2008.\n\nPublic Square has been the site of many notable people, buildings and inventions.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7717343", "categories": ["Buildings and structures in Watertown (city), New York", "Squares in New York (state)", "Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state)", "Landmarks in New York (state)"], "title": "Public Square (Watertown, New York)"}

This musical variety show was sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes and featured live musical performances. Perry Como initially hosted \"The Chesterfield Supper Club\" five nights a week. Initially, Como's female singer was Mary Ashworth.\n\nThe idea for the radio show originated with Doug Storer, who was then an advertising executive with the Blackman Company. Storer had heard Perry Como on his non-sponsored CBS radio program and believed he would do well in a radio show of the type he was proposing. Storer recorded a demo of the radio show with Como as its host and Mitchell Ayres and his Orchestra providing the music. He took the recording to the advertising agency that handled the Chesterfield cigarettes account.\n\nThe agency was enthusiastic about the program's format, but did not want Como as its host. The singer the agency preferred was under contract and would need to be released from it before he could accept a job on the new radio program. They asked Storer to get the singer released from his contract. Storer, who was still of the belief that the new show needed Como as its host, did not go through with the advertising agency's request. He received a call from the agency some weeks later, asking about the singer's contract and saying their new program would make its radio debut in about one week's time. Storer told them the right man for the radio show was the one who had made the demo recording-Perry Como. Chesterfield's advertising agency did not have time to do anything but sign Como as the host of the show.\n\nDuring the first year, Como was backed by the Ted Steele Orchestra, followed by the Lloyd Shaffer Orchestra at the end of 1945 until 1948. With John Klenner, Shaffer and Steele composed the show's theme song, \"Smoke Dreams.\" Roy Ringwald's \"A Cigarette, Sweet Music and You\" was also used on the show as a musical theme. The Satisfiers vocal group was also part of the program; they also made many records with Como.\n\nBeginning on the show's second anniversary, he hosted the show on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while Jo Stafford was the host on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Stafford returned to California shortly after becoming a co-host of the program. She began her twice-weekly broadcasts from Hollywood in November 1946, backed by her future husband, Paul Weston. Stafford's Hollywood \"Club\" broadcasts featured the vocal group The Starlighters; in 1947 she recorded her version of the show's theme song, \"Smoke Dreams\", with them.\nOne of the regular features was a \"Hollywood Star of the Week\" contest where an actor or actress would be featured as a \"guest star\" singing a song and the listening audience would guess the star's identity for prizes. The \"mystery star\" contest continued when the show appeared on television.\n\nThe broadcasts of April 5, 1946, made from a TWA plane at an altitude of 20,000 feet, are believed to be the first network radio broadcasts from an airplane. Jo Stafford, Perry Como, and the entire staff made the flight. There were two mid-air \"Supper Club\" broadcasts: one at 6 pm and another at 10 pm for the West Coast. A total of three flights were made; an earlier rehearsal flight for reception purposes was also made. In addition to the cast and the band's instruments, there was also a small piano on board. The three stand-held microphones brought onto the plane turned out to be less useful than expected. The cast then resorted to hand-held microphones, but the plane's cabin pressure made them very heavy and difficult to hold after a few minutes.\n\nLess than two months after the airborne \"Supper Club\" broadcasts, Chesterfield had an idea to take the program on a week of remote broadcasts: flying into Washington, DC for the Monday show, to London, for the Wednesday one and winding up with the Friday night show in Havana. The plan appears to have fallen from favor when it was learned that the taxes which would have been imposed on the Shaffer orchestra as foreign musicians performing in the UK meant Chesterfield would have needed to pay all orchestra members three times the amount of salary they were receiving at the time.\n\nBy 1947, announcer Martin Block was based in the Los Angeles area. Block did the announcing from Hollywood on the same days that Stafford hosted the show. Announcer and sportscaster Mel Allen took over the New York announcing duties for that year. When Block's West Coast contract was up, he returned to New York as the show's announcer. Block was also the announcer for the \"Supper Club\" television show.\n\nIn 1948, singer Peggy Lee was added to the roster, taking over the Thursday broadcast. Como was still broadcasting from New York, now backed by the Mitchell Ayres orchestra. The Satisfiers were replaced by the singing Fontane Sisters, who also appeared with Como on the televised \"Supper Club\" and his later television shows.\n\nBoth Stafford and Lee broadcast from Hollywood. Stafford continued to be backed by Paul Weston and his orchestra while Peggy Lee was backed by her husband, Dave Barbour, and his orchestra. The show featured musical performances by the host, along with various guest singers and orchestras, including Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Eddie Fisher, the Glenn Miller Orchestra, Nat King Cole, Victor Borge and others.\n\nBy September 1949, the show's time was extended from 15 minutes to a half-hour, and it was changed from a weekday to a weekly program.\n\nBeginning in February 2010, Sounds of Yesteryear began issuing CDs created from Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) transcriptions of the program from the years 1946 and 1947: \"At the Supper Club\", \"At the Supper Club Part II\", and \"At the Supper Club Part III\" for Perry Como, \"At the Supper Club\", \"At the Supper Club Part II\", \"At the Supper Club Part III\" for Jo Stafford, and \"At the Supper Club\" for Peggy Lee.\n\"The Chesterfield Supper Club\" appeared as a simulcast on NBC Television, beginning Christmas Eve, 1948, with a live performance by Perry Como. This was the beginning of Como's long-standing tradition of television Christmas specials.\n\nInitially, NBC had intended to broadcast three Friday night \"Supper Club\" shows on television as well as radio. The experiment had gone well enough for NBC to extend the experimental phase of televising \"The Chesterfield Supper Club\" through August 1949.\n\nOn September 8, 1949, \"Supper Club\" became a regularly scheduled television program. This series was the first of four regular primetime musical variety TV series hosted by Perry Como. He continued to host \"The Chesterfield Supper Club\" until 1950, when he moved to CBS and the NBC series ended. However, his association with Chesterfield continued with the \"Perry Como Chesterfield Show\" until 1955, when he returned to NBC.\n\n\n", "id": "7717480", "categories": ["1950s American television series", "American variety radio programs", "1940s American television series", "Jo Stafford", "1950 American television series endings", "Black-and-white television programs", "Perry Como", "American music radio programs", "1948 American television series debuts", "English-language television programs", "NBC network shows", "1940s American radio programs"], "title": "The Chesterfield Supper Club"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7717481", "text": "Employment authorization document\n\nA Form I-766 employment authorization document (EAD; ) or EAD card, known popularly as a work permit, is a document issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) that provides temporary employment authorization to noncitizens in the United States.\n\nCurrently the Form I-765 Employment Authorization Document is issued in the form of a standard credit card-size plastic card enhanced with multiple security features. The card contains some basic information about the immigrant: name, birth date, sex, immigrant category, country of birth, photo, immigrant registration number (also called \"A-number\"), card number, restrictive terms and conditions, and dates of validity. This document, however, should not be confused with the green card.\n\nTo request an Employment Authorization Document, noncitizens who qualify may file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. Applicants must then send the form via mail to the USCIS Regional Service Center that serves their area. If approved, an Employment Authorization Document will be issued for a specific period of time based on alien's immigration situation.\n\nThereafter, USCIS will issue Employment Authorization Documents in the following categories: \n\nFor employment-based green card applicants, the priority date needs to be current to apply for Adjustment of Status (I-485) at which time an Employment Authorization Document can be applied for. Typically, it is recommended to apply for Advance Parole at the same time so that visa stamping is not required when re-entering US from a foreign country.\n\nAn interim Employment Authorization Document is an Employment Authorization Document issued to an eligible applicant when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has failed to adjudicate an application within 90 days of receipt of a properly filed Employment Authorization Document application or within 30 days of a properly filed initial Employment Authorization Document application based on an asylum application filed on or after January 4, 1995. The interim Employment Authorization Document will be granted for a period not to exceed 240 days and is subject to the conditions noted on the document.\n\nAn interim Employment Authorization Document is no longer issued by local service centers. One can however take an INFOPASS appointment and place a service request at local centers, explicitly asking for it if the application exceeds 90 days and 30 days for asylum applicants without an adjudication.\n\nThe eligibility criteria for employment authorization is detailed in the Federal Regulations section 8 C.F.R. §274a.12. Only aliens who fall under the enumerated categories are eligible for an employment authorization document. Currently, there are more than 40 types of immigration status that make their holders eligible to apply for an Employment Authorization Document card. Some are nationality-based and apply to a very small number of people. Others are much broader, such as those covering the spouses of E-1, E-2, E-3, or L-1 visa holders.\n\nThe category includes the persons who either are given an Employment Authorization Document incident to their status or must apply for an Employment Authorization Document in order to accept the employment.\n\n\nThe following persons do not qualify for an Employment Authorization Document, nor can they accept any employment in the United States, unless the incident of status may allow.\n\n\nThe following persons do not qualify for an Employment Authorization Document, even if they are authorized to work in certain conditions, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service regulations (8 CFR Part 274a). Some statuses may be authorized to work only for a certain employer, under the term of 'alien authorized to work for the specific employer incident to the status', usually who has petitioned or sponsored the persons' employment. In this case, unless otherwise stated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, no approval from either the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is needed.\n\n\nUndocumented immigrants have been considered a source of low-wage labor, both in the formal and informal sectors of the economy. However, in the late 1980s with an increasing influx of un-regulated immigration, many worried about how this would impact the economy and, at the same time, citizens. Consequently, in 1986, Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act \"in order to control and deter illegal immigration to the United States\" resulting increasing patrolling of U.S. borders. Additionally, the Immigration Reform and Control Act implemented new employment regulations that imposed employer sanctions, criminal and civil penalties \"against employers who knowingly [hired] illegal workers\". Prior to this reform, employers were not required to verify the identity and employment authorization of their employees; for the very first time, this reform \"made it a crime for undocumented immigrants to work\" in the United States. \n\nThe Employment Eligibility Verification document (I-9) was required to be used by employers to \"verify the identity and employment authorization of individuals hired for employment in the United States\". While this form is not to be submitted unless requested by government officials, it is required that all employers have an I-9 form from each of their employees, which they must be retain for three years after day of hire or one year after employment is terminated.\n\nConcurrently, the Immigration Act of 1990 “increased the limits on lawful immigration to the United States,\" [...] \"established new nonimmigrant admission categories,\" and revised acceptable grounds for deportation. Most importantly, it brought to light the \"authorized temporary protected status\" for aliens of designated countries.\n\nThrough the revision and creation of new classes of nonimmigrants, qualified for admission and temporary working status, both IRCA and the Immigration Act of 1990 provided legislation for the regulation of employment of noncitizen.\n\nThe 9/11 attacks brought to the surface the weak aspect of the immigration system. After the September 11 attacks, the United States intensified its focus on interior reinforcement of immigration laws to reduce illegal immigration and to identify and remove criminal aliens.\n\nUndocumented Immigrants are individuals in the United States without lawful status. When these individuals qualify for some form of relief from deportation, individuals may qualify for some form of legal status. In this case, temporarily protected noncitizens are those who are granted \"the right to remain in the country and work during a designated period\". Thus, this is kind of an \"in-between status\" that provides individuals temporary employment and temporary relief from deportation, but it does not lead to permanent residency or citizenship status. Therefore, an Employment Authorization Document should not be confused with a legalization document and it is neither U.S. permanent resident status nor U.S. citizenship status. The Employment Authorization Document is given, as mentioned before, to eligible noncitizens as part of a reform or law that gives individuals temporary legal status\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7717481", "categories": ["Immigration to the United States"], "title": "Employment authorization document"}

Prior to 2008, it was known as the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs. \nThe United States House Committee on Appropriations has joint jurisdiction with the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations over all appropriations bills in the United States Congress. Each committee has 12 matching subcommittees, each of which is tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills. This subcommittee has jurisdiction over the budget for the United States Department of State and any Foreign Operations.\n\nTraditionally, after a federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year has been passed, the appropriations subcommittees receive information about what the budget sets as their spending ceilings. This is called \"302(b) allocations\" after section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. That amount is separated into smaller amounts for each of the twelve Subcommittees. The federal budget does not become law and is not signed by the President. Instead, it is guide for the House and the Senate in making appropriations and tax decisions. However, no budget is required and each chamber has procedures in place for what to do without one. The House and Senate now consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.\n\nAn appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The \"fiscal year\" is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. \n\nThere are three types of appropriations bills: regular appropriations bills, continuing resolutions, and supplemental appropriations bills. Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for the federal government for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1. If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time, it can pass a continuing resolution, which continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time. The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills, which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief. \n\nAppropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. Article One of the United States Constitution, section 9, clause 7, states that \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.\n\n\n", "id": "7717578", "categories": ["Subcommittees of the United States House of Representatives"], "title": "United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs"}

He joined J1 League team Júbilo Iwata in 1994 upon his return to Japan, then making a series of moves starting with Shimizu S-Pulse, JEF United Ichihara, Rijeka of Croatia, Delemont of Switzerland, Shonan Bellmare, Progreso of Uruguay, Avispa Fukuoka, Defensor Sporting of Uruguay, Okinawa Kariyushi FC and Shizuoka FC. Playing for a total of 12 different clubs during his playing career.\n\nMatsubara also represented the Japan U-23 National team, and was part of the 1996 Summer Olympics team which famously defeated the Brazil which included players such as Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos and Bebeto.\n\nAfter announcing his retirement in 2005, he established Felice Mondo Inc. as the CEO of the company. He also holds the positions of General Manager of the Gyosei International School Astra International football program, and Vice Chairman of the J.League Players OB Party.\n\nBorn in Hamamatsu, Matsubara was influenced by his older brother Shinya Matsubara in his start to football. Shinya captained his school team, and Matsubara was often drawn to watch some of his games.\n\nShinya moved to Argentina in his second year of high school and signed a professional football contract. Following in his older brothers footsteps, Matsubara sought advice to travel to Argentina himself, but was turned down. After graduating from high school, Matsubara attended university but left shortly after enrolling to reconsider his future. Although Matsubara had represented Japan as a member of the national U17 team, as the J1 League had not been established at the time, he had no particular desire to become a professional football player. It was Kazuyoshi Miura who helped change his mind.\n\nUpon Kazutoshi Miura's triumphal return from Brazil, Matsubara watched one of Miura's games. What he saw that day inspired Matsubara to want to become a professional player. In his pursuit to sign for a professional club, Matsubara participated in trials at his local clubs Shimizu S-Pulse, and Yamaha Motors (Now Júbilo Iwata), clubs which were on the brink of joining the J1 League at the time. Matsubara was unsuccessful however, and instead decided to travel abroad to find a club after being recommended by Masakuni Yamamoto of the Japan Football Association, who was putting together a team to compete in the 1996 Summer Olympics at the time.\n\nStarting in Uruguay, Matsubara moved to Europe to play in Switzerland, Croatia and Germany before making his way back to South America to experience football in Brazil and Argentina. After returning to Japan to play for several clubs in the J1 League, Matsubara retired from football after completing a spell at Shizuoka FC as player manager.\n\nOut of all the countries Matsubara visited, Uruguay left the biggest influence on his life. He learnt Spanish during his time in Uruguay, and now also speaks English, Italian and Portuguese. He continues to play football for fun with other ex-J.Leaguers under a team called FC Infinitos. Matsubara credits Mr. Tagawa, principle of Gyosei International School of making an enormous impression on his life away from football.\n\nMatsubara has been a big fan of Diego Maradona since early childhood, and still keeps a picture of Maradona and himself on his wall.\n\nAfter his brother returned from Argentina, Shinya joined professional team Shimizu S-Pulse. This move set up a rare sibling derby match up when Shimizu S-Pulse played Matsubara’s team Júbilo Iwata in the reserve league. His brother now works in Hamamatsu for the Shizuoka Prefecture Football Association, and will work as a coach for Hamamatsu University from 2013.\n\nAfter retiring as a professional player, Matsubara struggled searching for a second career at first. Ultimately he chose to stay working in the world of football however, as a way of giving something back to the sport which made him so successful. Founded on the philosophy of teaching children in a relaxed manner and taking time to concentrate on building character, Matsubara opened his first Football school in 2005, aiming to offer the best children’s coaching in the country.\n\nLater in 2009, Matsubara established FELICE MONDO Inc. The company has expanded in recent years, establishing football schools in Roppongi (Tokyo), Urayasu (Chiba) and Kisarazu (Chiba). Club teams were also established in Roppongi (junior) and Urayasu (junior youth).\n\nMatsubara was also involved in the revitalization project of Gyosei International School through football, establishing the Astra International football course, and taking the position of General Manager. By testing his own management skills and establishing relationships with people from different backgrounds and industries, he has gained many supporters and contributors to his project. He has a long-term vision of community development through football education across Japan, with his ultimate dream of Japan hosting and winning the world cup. In order to achieve his dream, he has placed importance on improving links with the rest of the world to improve the quality of Japan's youth, and developing the quality of the J.League as a whole.\n\n2005: Opens FELICE Football School\n2009: Established FELICE MONDO INC. (transition from Felice Football School) Position of CEO\nTakes position of Gyosei International School General Manager of Astra International course. Takes position of Vice Chairman of the J.League Players OB Party.\nBecomes player advisor of TAKE ACTION F.C Foundation.\n\nFelice Mondo name means “happy world” in Italian. A name which Derives from the concept of creating a happy world by playing football. As well as operating a number of football schools in the Kanto region, the company holds football tournaments in Kisarazu City (in cooperation with the City), with over 3,000 athletes participating annually. As a guest, Matsubara has invited former Japan national team manager Philippe Troussier, ex-Juventus player Paolo Montero, ex-Japan internationals Tetsuji Hashiratani, Yutaka Akita, Motohiro Yamaguchi, Takayuki Suzuki, Eisuke Nakanishi, Akihiro Endo, Yasuto Honda, and Masaaki Sawanobori.\n\nMatsubara attended the Instituto Superior de Education Fisica (ISEF) in Uruguay in 2002, and started studying as a coach. Receiving his first coaching certificate in 2005, by 2010 he was awarded with his S Level certificate by the Japan Football Association, completing the set which allows him to coach/manage teams in the J.League.\n\nMatsubara believes that in order to build a strong football nation, it is important for Japan to nurture its youth. Having spent time living abroad in his youth, he also emphasizes the importance of travelling abroad while you are young. Through various activities, he aims to foster humans who can thrive in the world, and represent Japan.\n\nHe considers the importance of offering guidance to children of all ages from early childhood to play a vital role in developing children. Accordingly, Matsubara has continuously taught over 1,000 children of all ages who have attended one of his football schools or clubs, Gyosei International Junior High school football club, Gakushuin Junior High football club and Gyosei International High school football club.\n\nInvolved in the establishment of the Gyosei international school Astra football club (junior high and high school), with the help and cooperation of the school and the community, the members of the club have grown from 0 to 160 in just four years. The junior high team has been promoted to the Chiba Prefecture 1st Division, and likewise, the high school team has also been promoted to the 1st division, making the team one of the top teams in the Prefecture.\n\nGyosei International School has set a long term aim of becoming one of the strongest schools (junior high and high school) for football in the country. The school aims to develop “humans who can shine in the world” by teaching its students the three main principles of football, studying (English) and human interaction.\n\nIn recent years, the focus has been shifted to focus on the development and quality of football coaching. Regular coaching academy sessions for local coaches have been scheduled to improve the quality in coaching.\n\n\nFollowing the devastation caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, Matsubara worked together with ex-Japanese internationals Yutaka Akita and Keiji Ishizuka in 2012 to create the Tohoku Charity T-shirt project. 300 T-shirts signed by Paolo Montero, Alvaro Recoba and Ruben Sosa were all sold within 2 weeks. The proceeds to the T-shirts went towards inviting Nakano football club, a children’s team from the disaster affected area of Tohoku, to participate in a football tournament held by Felice in Gyosei International school. As a guest, Paulo Montero was also invited to join the tournament and held a talk show to the children. There are also plans to re-invite Nakano football club to the next tournament.\n\nAs part of his volunteer work in the local community, the company makes over 80 visits to kindergartens to hold free football clinics in Minato Ward.\n\nThe company also cooperates with the nonprofit organization, CP Football & Life Esperanza to offer football coaching to 7-a-side disabled football team.\n\nTV\n\nRadio\n\nColumn\n\nLectures\n\n", "id": "7717587", "categories": ["1974 births", "Expatriate footballers in Switzerland", "J3 League managers", "Swiss Super League players", "Japanese expatriate sportspeople in Croatia", "Expatriate footballers in Croatia", "Association football people from Shizuoka Prefecture", "Living people", "Japanese expatriate footballers", "Football clinics", "Japanese football managers", "HNK Rijeka players", "Expatriate footballers in Uruguay", "Croatian First Football League players", "Shonan Bellmare players", "J2 League players", "Peñarol players", "JEF United Chiba players", "Shimizu S-Pulse players", "SC Sagamihara managers", "Avispa Fukuoka players", "Progreso players", "Footballers at the 1996 Summer Olympics", "Defensor Sporting players", "Olympic footballers of Japan", "Japanese footballers", "J1 League players", "Júbilo Iwata players"], "title": "Yoshika Matsubara"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7717612", "text": "Math wars\n\nMath wars is the debate over modern mathematics education, textbooks and curricula in the United States that was triggered by the publication in 1989 of the \"Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics\" by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and subsequent development and widespread adoption of a new generation of mathematics curricula inspired by these standards.\n\nWhile the discussion about math skills has persisted for many decades, the term \"math wars\" was coined by commentators such as John A. Van de Walle and David Klein. The debate is over traditional mathematics and reform mathematics philosophy and curricula, which differ significantly in approach and content.\n\nThe largest supporter of reform in the US has been the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.\n\nOne aspect of the debate is over how explicitly children must be taught skills based on formulas or algorithms (fixed, step-by-step procedures for solving math problems) versus a more inquiry-based approach in which students are exposed to real-world problems that help them develop fluency in number sense, reasoning, and problem-solving skills. In this latter approach, conceptual understanding is a primary goal and algorithmic fluency is expected to follow secondarily. Some parents and other stakeholders blame educators saying that failures occur not because the method is at fault, but because these educational methods require a great deal of expertise and have not always been implemented well in actual classrooms.\n\nA backlash, which advocates call \"poorly understood reform efforts\" and critics call \"a complete abandonment of instruction in basic mathematics,\" resulted in \"math wars\" between reform and traditional methods of mathematics education.\n\nThose who disagree with the inquiry-based philosophy maintain that students must first\ndevelop computational skills before they can understand concepts of mathematics. These\nskills should be memorized and practiced, using time-tested traditional methods until they become automatic. Time is better spent practicing skills rather than in investigations inventing alternatives, or justifying more than one correct answer or method. In this view, estimating answers is insufficient and, in fact, is considered to be dependent on strong foundational skills. Learning abstract concepts of mathematics is perceived to depend on a solid base of knowledge of the tools of the subject.\n\nSupporters of traditional mathematics teaching oppose excessive dependence on innovations such as calculators or new technology, such as the Logo language. Student innovation is acceptable, even welcome, as long as it is mathematically valid. Calculator use can be appropriate after number sense has developed and basic skills have been mastered. Constructivist methods which are unfamiliar to many adults, and books which lack explanations of methods or solved examples make it difficult to help with homework. Compared to worksheets which can be completed in minutes, constructivist activities can be more time consuming. (Reform educators respond that more time is lost in reteaching poorly understood algorithms.) Emphasis on reading and writing also increases the language load for immigrant students and parents who may be unfamiliar with English.\n\nCritics of reform point out that traditional methods are still universally and exclusively used in industry and academia. Reform educators respond that such methods are still the ultimate goal of reform mathematics, and that students need to learn flexible thinking in order to face problems they may not know a method for. Critics maintain that it is unreasonable to expect students to \"discover\" the standard methods through investigation, and that flexible thinking can only be developed after mastering foundational skills. Commentators have argued that there is philosophical support for the notion that \"algorithmic fluency\" requires the very types of cognitive activity whose promotion reform advocates often claim is their approaches' unique virtue. However, such arguments assume that reformers do not want to teach the standard algorithms, which is a common misunderstanding of the reform position.\n\nSome curricula incorporate research by Constance Kamii and others that concluded that direct teaching of traditional algorithms is counterproductive to conceptual understanding of math. Critics have protested some of the consequences of this research. Traditional memorization methods are replaced with constructivist activities. Students who demonstrate proficiency in a standard method are asked to invent another method of arriving at the answer. Some parents have accused reform math advocates of deliberately slowing down students with greater ability in order to \"paper-over\" the inequalities of the American school system. Some teachers supplement such textbooks in order to teach standard methods more quickly. Some curricula do not teach long division. Critics believe the NCTM revised its standards to explicitly call for continuing instruction of standard methods, largely because of the negative response to some of these curricula (see below). College professors and employers have sometimes claimed that students that have been taught using reform curricula do not possess basic mathematical skills. One study found that, although first-grade students in 1999 with an average or above-average aptitude for math did equally well with either teacher-directed or student-centered instruction, first-grade students with mathematical difficulties did better with teacher-directed instruction.\n\nExamples of reform curricula introduced in response to the 1989 NCTM standards and the reasons for initial criticism:\n\nCritics of reform textbooks say that they present concepts in a haphazard way. Critics of the reform textbooks and curricula support traditional textbooks such as Singapore math, which emphasizes direct instruction of basic mathematical concepts, and Saxon math, which emphasizes frequent cumulative review.\n\nReform educators have responded by pointing out that research tends to show that students achieve greater conceptual understanding from standards-based curricula than traditional curricula and that these gains do not come at the expense of basic skills. In fact students tend to achieve the same procedural skill level in both types of curricula as measured by traditional standardized tests. More research is needed, but the current state of research seems to show that reform textbooks work as well as or better than traditional textbooks in helping students achieve computational competence while promoting greater conceptual understanding than traditional approaches.\n\nIn 2000 the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) released the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM), which was seen as more balanced than the original 1989 Standards. This led to some calming, but not an end to the dispute. Two recent reports have led to considerably more cooling of the Math Wars. In 2006, NCTM released its \"Curriculum Focal Points\", which was seen by many as a compromise position. In 2008, the National Mathematics Advisory Panel, created by George Bush, called for a halt to all extreme positions.\n\nIn 2006, the NCTM released \"Curriculum Focal Points\", a report on the topics considered central for mathematics in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade. Its inclusion of standard algorithms led editorials in newspapers like the Chicago Sun Times to state that the \"NCTM council has admitted, more or less, that it goofed,\" and that the new report cited \"inconsistency in the grade placement of mathematics topics as well as in how they are defined and what students are expected to learn.\" NCTM responded by insisting that it considers \"Focal Points\" a step in the implementation of the Standards, not a reversal of its position on teaching students to learn foundational topics with conceptual understanding. Francis Fennell, president of the NCTM, stated that there had been no change of direction or policy in the new report and said that he resented talk of “math wars”. The Focal Points were one of the documents consulted to create the new national Common Core Standards, which are being adopted by most of the United States.\n\nOn April 18, 2006, President Bush created the National Mathematics Advisory Panel, which was modeled after the influential National Reading Panel. The National Math Panel examined and summarized the scientific evidence related to the teaching and learning of mathematics, concluding in their 2008 report, \"All-encompassing recommendations that instruction should be entirely 'student centered' or 'teacher directed' are not supported by research. If such recommendations exist, they should be rescinded. If they are being considered, they should be avoided. High-quality research does not support the exclusive use of either approach.\" The Panel effectively called for an end to the Math Wars, concluding that research showed \"conceptual understanding, computational and procedural fluency, and problem solving skills are equally important and mutually reinforce each other. Debates regarding the relative importance of each of these components of mathematics are misguided.\"\n\nThe Panel's final report met with significant criticism within the mathematics education community for, among other issues, the selection criteria used to determine \"high-quality\" research, their comparison of extreme forms of teaching, and the amount of focus placed on algebra.\n\n", "id": "7717612", "categories": ["Mathematics education", "Education reform", "Mathematics education reform", "Standards-based education"], "title": "Math wars"}

As a tenor saxophonist and band leader in California, Benedetti first heard a record of Parker in the Spring of 1945. Deeply influenced by the player, Benedetti began to study Parker, transcribing solos, building them into set pieces, and working bop into his own playing.\n\nA two-week engagement at LA's Hi-De-Ho Club in early 1947, done on discs, was the start of Benedetti's recordings. In 1948, Benedetti headed to New York with bandmate Jimmy Knepper, and recorded Charlie Parker on March 31, and July 7, both of these on a Sears tape recorder.\n\nWhile in New York, Benedetti began to use heroin. Unable to break into the New York music scene, he returned to his parents home in California in 1948. Trying to finance their way back home, Benedetti and Knepper attempt to sell drugs.

It was composed in 1945 and received its premiere in Paris on May 5, 1946 directed by Robert Lawrence. In the following year the American premiere was given in Los Angeles, Alfred Wallenstein directing.\n\nThe symphony is Moore's second essay in that form and is dedicated to the memory of Stephen Vincent Benét, who supplied the libretto for Moore's opera \"The Devil and Daniel Webster\". A work of moderate length and a classical conception inspired by Haydn, it represents Moore's fully formed mature style and is unarguably one of his best pieces. Moore himself described it as: \"an attempt to write in clear, objective, modified classical style, with emphasis on rhythmic and melodic momentum rather than upon sharply contrasted themes or dramatic climaxes\".\n\nIt is in four movements, three of which end in a quiet manner. The symphony lasts approximately twenty minutes.\n\nThe first movement starts with a solemnly lyric and wistful theme given out by trumpet, then oboe and strings, which is carried out through the first section in a somewhat nostalgic fashion. The calmness is later abandoned in favour of a more lilting and dancelike mood on strings, which moves along in a processional way before a crescendo leads to the short coda ending the movement in silence. This movement features significant more use of percussion, xylophone and triangle, than the other three.\n\nWhilst the symphony as a whole isn't in any way programmatic, the second movement was in part inspired by a James Joyce poem concerning twilight music. This is understandable, as most of the music is nocturnal save for a few passionate outbursts which may relate to the work \"In Memoriam\" of a few years earlier. It is clearly indicative of Moore's ability to write sensitive and heartfelt music.\n\nThis is the shortest and most jovial and most obviously neoclassical of all the movements. It starts with a happy and bubbling theme on woodwinds which forms the basis of the whole movement. In the more animated middle section (where the woodwind indulges in some trilling baroquery) a second theme on trumpet is countered by the main theme in a delightfully contrapuntal way before winding down into stillness.\n\nThe beginning of the last movement is proclaimed, in a declamatory fashion, on brass only to introduce the robust and energetic main theme which persists throughout. Following the introduction the orchestra leads into a rondo-like section with alternatingly rousing and flowing treatments, where the main theme dominates. After several louder expositions the main theme is played out faster on strings building up a heroic atmosphere and leading to a bursting crescendo of kinetic energy after which a drumroll leads the movement to the spirited closing diminuendo.\n", "id": "7717658", "categories": ["Compositions by Douglas Moore", "1945 compositions", "20th-century symphonies"], "title": "Symphony No. 2 (Moore)"}

The main events of the Malvern Fringe Festival were the annual Malvern May Day and parade, and the annual three-day festival held in June as a fringe to the Elgar Festival. These were often accompanied by musical and other live events throughout the year.\n\nMalvern Fringe Festival was founded in 1977 by Adrian Mealing, a teacher in Malvern, in collaboration with Andrew Sleigh, Ian Fearnside and Phil Webb. It originated as a reaction to the Malvern Festival which was perceived to be biased towards classical music and appealing towards a national and international audience rather than a local one. A further concern was the continued requirement for the local Council to underwrite the main festival and the feeling that the public expenditure could be more wisely spent.\n\nThe founding aims of the Fringe were to produce a popular, varied programme of events for the local people of Malvern, to bridge the gap between the \"us\" and \"them\" in the arts and to \"shake it up a bit in Malvern\".\n\nThe first year featured 60 events consisting of poetry, world music, folk, jazz, adult and children's theatre performed under the banner of \"Associated Events\" due to the main Festival's objections to the term 'Fringe', which they considered to be \"outside\" of the Festival. In 1978, to avoid confusion between the programmes for the two festivals, printed with similar designs at the main festival's insistence, Adrian Mealing hand wrote \"Fringe\" on over 3000 programmes. As the 1980s approached, the festival grew into a four-week event and the Fringe had established its own identity. Being centrally located between Hereford, Worcester, Gloucester and Cheltenham the Fringe drew a wide audiences from over a 20-mile radius.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the festival attracted hundreds of visitors with a programme of 120 events over a two-week period.\n\nIn 2006 the Fringe re-launched its three-day festival in June, loosely based upon a theme of Elgar's interests. One of the highlights of this festival was a bicycle race (as cycling was one of Elgar's keen interests) up the steep incline of Great Malvern's Church Street. This event was supported by Commonwealth games gold medalist Liam Killeen, who's from Malvern, and was won by Tour de France cyclist, Arnaud Lenoir. The whole three-day festival was attended by over 5,000 people.\n\nIn the autumn of 2006, the Fringe launched a 'folk weekend' featuring Roy Bailey and Jez Lowe.\n\nThe Malvern May Day and Parade are an annual community event which has been held in Priory Park, Great Malvern on the Saturday before the May Bank Holiday since 1993.\n\nDespite an attendance of over 5,000 people the June 2006 festival has been the subject of much negative coverage in the letters pages of the local newspaper with one correspondent calling upon readers to petition the local Member of Parliament to halt any further Fringe activities.\n\nThroughout its history Malvern Fringe featured an impressive array of performers, many of whom have gone on to become international stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7717675", "categories": ["Festivals in Worcestershire", "Fringe festivals in the United Kingdom", "Culture in Worcestershire", "Recurring events established in 1977", "Spring festivals", "Charities based in Worcestershire", "Malvern, Worcestershire"], "title": "Malvern Fringe Festival"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7717695", "text": "United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security\n\nThe House Subcommittee on Homeland Security is a standing subcommittee within the House Appropriations Committee. The United States House Committee on Appropriations has joint jurisdiction with the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations over all appropriations bills in the United States Congress. Each committee has 12 matching subcommittees, each of which is tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills. This subcommittee has jurisdiction over the budget for the United States Department of Homeland Security.\n\nTraditionally, after a federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year has been passed, the appropriations subcommittees receive information about what the budget sets as their spending ceilings. This is called \"302(b) allocations\" after section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. That amount is separated into smaller amounts for each of the twelve Subcommittees. The federal budget does not become law and is not signed by the President. Instead, it is guide for the House and the Senate in making appropriations and tax decisions. However, no budget is required and each chamber has procedures in place for what to do without one. The House and Senate now consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.\n\nAn appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The \"fiscal year\" is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. \n\nThere are three types of appropriations bills: regular appropriations bills, continuing resolutions, and supplemental appropriations bills. Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for the federal government for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1. If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time, it can pass a continuing resolution, which continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time. The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills, which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief. \n\nAppropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. Article One of the United States Constitution, section 9, clause 7, states that \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bill\n\n", "id": "7717695", "categories": ["Subcommittees of the United States House of Representatives"], "title": "United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security"}

They fought in the French army for ten years, seeing service in several notable engagements, including the Battle of Marignano and the Battle of Pavia.\n\nThe Black Band was created as the Black Guard in 1514 by George, Duke of Saxony, to fight for his claims in East Frisia against Edzard I, Count of East Frisia, in what was to become known as the Saxon feud.\n\nIt is not clear whether the band was newly founded or a continuation of the \"Great\" or \"Black Guard\" that had been founded in 1488 by Landsknechts formerly in Imperial service with Maximilian in Flanders. It fought in Northern Germany and Denmark, often against rebellious peasants, until its defeat at the Battle of Hemmingstedt on 17 February 1500. It is possible that at least some Fähnlein of the Black Guard survived during these fourteen years and were part, if not core, of the new formation.\n\nThis Black Guard took part in the campaign in East Frisia in 1514 and devastated large parts of it in the process. When the participation of George of Saxony in the Saxon Feud ended in 1515 at the mediation of Charles II, Duke of Guelders and Francis I of France, Charles of Guelders hired them and led them in support of Francis to Italy, where they entered French service. \nThere they joined an existing contingent of 12,000 Landsknechts in French service, originally drafted for a planned invasion of England under the Yorkist pretender Richard de la Pole, that was aborted after the Anglo-French peace treaty of St Germain-en-Laye in 1514. Many of these Landsknechts were originally sent \"on loan\" to the French by Maximilian between 1512 and 1513 for service in Italy, notably at Brescia and Ravenna, and had defied his recall to Imperial service. Some of the members of the Black Band also chose not to enter French service and heed that recall.\n\nThe distinction between both contingents gets lost and most sources call the whole French Landsknecht contingent the \"Black Band\" or \"Black Legion\" at the time of the Battle of Marignano.\n\nThe full Landsknecht contingent of Francis I. army in 1515 was initially 17,000 men strong, composed of 12,000 pikemen, 2,000 arquebusiers, 2,000 two-handed swordsmen, and 1,000 halberdiers. Landsknecht contingents are organized in companies or Fähnlein of up to 500, with actual numbers often being lower than the nominal full strength.\n\nCaptain of the Black Band in 1525 was Georg Langenmantel, but it was also placed under the command of French officers, such as at Pavia, when it was nominally led by François de Lorraine and Richard de la Pole. By the time of the Battle of Pavia, they are described by Delbrück as 5,000 strong, by Konstam as 4,000 strong.\n\nThe Black Band marched into Italy in 1515 in time to fight alongside King Francis I at the Battle of Marignano, where, defending the ditch and supported by artillery, they nonetheless recoiled from the attacking Swiss, but did not break. Eventually they were relieved by the charge of the French \"gendarme\" heavy cavalry into the flank of the Swiss attack column.\n\nTen years later they were still in French service and appeared as the lead French infantry square at the Battle of Pavia, led by Francois de Lorraine and Richard de la Pole. In this battle they found themselves heavily outnumbered by two blocks of 12,000 Imperial Landsknechts opposing them, led by Georg von Frundsberg and Max Sittich von Ems. Before the battle Georg Langenmantel, Obrist of the band, stepped out and tried to challenge Frundsberg or Ems to single combat, but was killed by the Imperials in response. Struck in both flanks -- “seize[d] … as if with tongs”—and hacked to pieces, the Black Band was killed almost to the last man, including both of their leaders, and ceased to exist.\n\nIt was refounded and fought with a strength of 4,000 under Lautrec in the campaign against the Imperial army in Naples. The destruction of that army in August 1528 saw some 2,000 survivors, many of whom found service with the Imperial Landsknechts.\n\n", "id": "7717715", "categories": ["Landsknechts"], "title": "Black Band (landsknechts)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7717738", "text": "Contact resistance\n\nThe term contact resistance refers to the contribution to the total resistance of a system which can be attributed to the contacting interfaces of electrical leads and connections as opposed to the intrinsic resistance, which is an inherent property, independent of the measurement method. This effect is often described by the term Electrical Contact Resistance or ECR and may vary with time, most often decreasing, in a process known as resistance creep. The idea of potential drop on the injection electrode was introduced by William Shockley to explain the difference between the experimental results and the model of gradual channel approximation. In addition to the term ECR, \"Interface resistance\", \"transitional resistance\", or just simply \"correction term\" are also used. The term \"parasitic resistance\" has been used as a more general term, where it is usually still assumed that the contact resistance has a major contribution.\n\nHere we need to distinguish the contact resistance evaluation in two-electrode systems (e.g. diodes) and three-electrode systems (e.g. transistors).\n\nFor two electrode systems the specific contact resistivity is experimentally defined as the slope of the I-V curve at V=0:\n\nwhere J is the current density = current/area. The units of specific contact resistivity are typically therefore in formula_2 where formula_3 stands for ohms. When the current is a linear function of the voltage, the device is said to have ohmic contacts.\n\nThe resistance of contacts can be crudely estimated by comparing the results of a four terminal measurement to a simple two-lead measurement made with an ohmmeter. In a two-lead experiment, the measurement current causes a potential drop across both the test leads and the contacts so that the resistance of these elements is inseparable from the resistance of the actual device, with which they are in series. In a four-point probe measurement, one pair of leads is used to inject the measurement current while a second pair of leads, in parallel with the first, is used to measure the potential drop across the device. In the four-probe case, there is no potential drop across the voltage measurement leads so the contact resistance drop is not included. The difference between resistance derived from two-lead and four-lead methods is a reasonably accurate measurement of contact resistance assuming that the leads resistance is much smaller. Specific contact resistance can be obtained by multiplying by contact area. It should also be noted that the contact resistance may vary with temperature.\n\nInductive and capacitive methods could be used in principle to measure an intrinsic impedance without the complication of contact resistance. In practice, direct current methods are more typically used to determine resistance.\n\nThe three electrode systems such as transistors require more complicated methods for the contact resistance approximation. The most common approach is the transmission line model (TLM). Here, the total device resistance formula_4 is plotted as a function of the channel length:\n\nwhere formula_6 and formula_7 are contact and channel resistances, respectively, formula_8 is the channel length/width, formula_9 is gate insulator capacitance (per unit of area), formula_10 is carrier mobility, and formula_11 and formula_12 are gate-source and drain-source voltages. Therefore, the linear extrapolation of total resistance to the zero channel length provides the contact resistance. The slope of the linear function is related to the channel transconductance and can be used for estimation of the ”contact resistance-free” carrier mobility. The approximations used here (linear potential drop across the channel region, constant contact resistance...) lead sometimes to the channel dependent contact resistance.\n\nBeside the TLM it was proposed the gated four-probe measurement and the modified time-of-flight method (TOF). The direct methods able to measure potential drop on the injection electrode directly are the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KFM) and the electric-field induced second harmonic generation.\n\nFor given physical and mechanical material properties, parameters that govern the magnitude of electrical contact resistance (ECR) and its variation at an interface relate primarily to surface structure and applied load (Contact mechanics). Surfaces of metallic contacts generally exhibit an external layer of oxide material and adsorbed water molecules, which lead to capacitor-type junctions at weakly contacting asperities and resistor type contacts at strongly contacting asperities, where sufficient pressure is applied for asperities to penetrate the oxide layer, forming metal-to-metal contact patches. If a contact patch is sufficiently small, with dimensions comparable or smaller than the mean free path of electrons resistance at the patch can be described by the Sharvin mechanism, whereby electron transport can be described by ballistic conduction. Generally, over time, contact patches expand and the contact resistance at an interface relaxes, particularly at weakly contacting surfaces, through current induced welding and dielectric breakdown. This process is known also as resistance creep. The coupling of surface chemistry, contact mechanics and charge transport mechanisms needs to be considered in the mechanistic evaluation of ECR phenomena.\n\nWhen a conductor has spatial dimensions close to formula_13, where formula_14 is Fermi wavevector of the conducting material, Ohm's law does not hold anymore. These small devices are called quantum point contacts. Their conductance must be an integer multiple of the value formula_15, where formula_16 is the electronic charge and formula_17 is Planck's constant. Quantum point contacts behave more like waveguides than the classical wires of everyday life and may be described by the Landauer scattering formalism. Point-contact tunneling is an important technique for characterizing superconductors.\n\nMeasurements of thermal conductivity are also subject to contact resistance, with particular significance in heat transport through granular media. Similarly, a drop in hydrostatic pressure (analogous to electrical voltage) occurs when fluid flow transitions from one channel to another.\n\nBad contacts are the cause of failure or poor performance in a wide variety of electrical devices. For example, corroded jumper cable clamps can frustrate attempts to start a vehicle that has a low battery. Dirty or corroded contacts on a fuse or its holder can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial heating in a high current device.

It was originally released as a single in the UK on 26 June 1970, being an edit of the version that appeared on the album \"Hawkwind\".\n\nTowards the end of 1969, still using the name Hawkwind Zoo and with Mick Slattery as the lead guitarist, the band were given studio time by Don Poole to record some demos. \"Hurry On Sundown\" was one of the tracks recorded, this version being more electric and psychedelic than the acoustic folky feel of the album version. The recording was eventually released in 1981 as the first of a host of archive material issued through Flicknife Records.\n\nAnother previously unheard track recorded at the same session, \"Sweet Mistress of Pain\" (also known as \"Kiss of the Velvet Whip\"), was included on the B-side, as was an alternate version of the 1975 single \"Kings of Speed\". The two original Hawkwind Zoo demos were eventually included on the remasters version of the \"Hawkwind\" debut album with a third, a cover of Pink Floyd's \"Cymbaline\".\n\nThe band recorded a version at Maida Vale Studios on 18 August 1970 for broadcast on the BBC Radio programme \"Top Gear\" on 19 September 1970. Poor quality recordings of this session were first released, without the BBC's permission, on \"The Text of Festival\" in 1983, then on various subsequent compilations. No official clean version of this track has ever been released.\n\n", "id": "7717740", "categories": ["1970 debut singles", "Hawkwind songs", "Songs written by Dave Brock"], "title": "Hurry On Sundown"}

In kinesics, the science of body language, calypsis is the act of covering or concealing certain parts of one's own body. Calypsis is a type of closed, negative or defensive body language used to express disapproval, discomfort or fear in certain situations. The term usually refers to the act of covering or concealing one’s face, or sexually attractive parts (including certain sexually attractive clothing), especially in the presence of someone who is a sexual turn-off (extremely anerotic), or someone who is uncomfortable to be around. The term \"calypsis\" was derived from the Greek \"καλυπτω\" ---\"kalupto\" or \"kalypto\", meaning to cover, to veil, to hide, or to conceal. Calypsis is a type of closed or negative body language often expressing extremely anerotic feelings, sexual abhorrence, scorn and contempt toward someone viewed as a sexual turn-off in terms of physical appearance, in terms of personality and social behavior, or both. The term calypsis can also refer to a bride placing a veil over her face during her wedding while preparing to marry her groom, or to a criminal concealing his/her face with a ski mask while perpetrating a burglary, robbery, or sniper attack. Calypses (plural of calypsis) are done in many different ways by various people in various situations for various reasons (including for defensive purposes), and are often done subconsciously like most other forms of body language.\n\n\n", "id": "7717812", "categories": [], "title": "Calypsis"}

He worked for Douglas Aircraft's Production Planning and Illustration Departments during WWII, and by 1945 had built a number of catamaran sailboats. In 1947, John Green, a yachtsman friend, paid Tritt to design and build a racing sailboat in the range. Fiberglass seemed the logical construction material, and Otto Bayer of Wizard Boats was enlisted as laminator. The boat was named the Green Dolphin, and four were built in various lengths. This was Tritt's first effort in fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP). By 1948 he was building small fiberglass sailing dinghies, and built the first ever fiberglass masts and spars for sailboats. This company became the Glasspar Company and moved to larger quarters from Industrial Way in Costa Mesa to Harbor Blvd in Costa Mesa, California, in 1950. By 1951, Glasspar moved again to larger quarters in Santa Ana, California. By the mid-1950s, Glasspar was producing 15 to 20 percent of all fiberglass boats sold in the U.S. By 1958, branch factories were operating in Nashville, Tennessee, Petersburg, Virginia, Olympia, Washington, and Sherman, Texas.\n\nGlasspar built boats in ranges from car toppers to models and everything in between. Just prior to 1969, when Glasspar was sold off, there were even oceangoing models. Boats were often given Mediterranean-sounding names, and the boat classes within the model were often indicated by a model type then model name, with a hyphen in between. For example, in the range there was a model called the Lido, which came in three configurations: the Sport-Lido, Club-Lido, and Lido (standard). Another line, called the Mariner, included the Sport-Mariner, Club-Mariner, or Mariner (standard) model. Some boat models were also named for areas in and around Southern California, such as Avalon on the island of Catalina and Del Mar, a coastal community north of San Diego.\n\nModels included, but were not limited to;\n\nGlasspar was also one of the first companies to build fiberglass-bodied cars, most notably the G2 (Glasspar), but including the Woodill Wildfire, the Studebaker-based Ascot and the Volvo Sport. The G2 was a prime influence on the decision for Chevrolet to develop the Corvette.\n\nThe company was eventually sold to Larson Boat Works.\n\nRestoring and preserving Glasspar boats and cars has become extremely popular in recent years. The official Glasspar Owners Association can be found at Classic Glasspars\n\nExtensive information can be found at the Owners Association Website to include factory brochures, production data and even patents.\n", "id": "7717815", "categories": ["American boat builders", "Companies based in Santa Ana, California"], "title": "Glasspar"}

Founded as a Jesuit venture in 1951, it is now an autonomous college, offering full and part-time courses from undergraduate to postgraduate level, in areas related to, among others, psychology, finance, business and computing. All courses are delivered from the IFSC campus in Dublin and across a network of regional centres.\n\nNCI’s specialist areas include psychology, human resource management, data analytics, management, cloud computing, fintech, accountancy, cybersecurity, education, and finance. NCI is also known for its free public events which include the dot conf digital and web technology conference, the \"Legends In Your Lunchtime\" series, the \"Seven Deadly Skills\", \"In the Psychologists' Chair\" and \"Marketing Mavericks\".\n\nIn 1951, the National College of Ireland started out as the Catholic Workers College, Dublin in Sandford Lodge, Ranelagh. Founded by Fr. Edward Coyne S.J., others involved in the college in its initial years included Professor Thomas A. Finlay S.J., and Rev. Edmund Kent S.J. among others.\n\nLectures were led by a handful of dedicated Jesuits two nights a week, with 103 registered students in the first year. Within 10 years, student numbers had dramatically increased. Links with trade unions deepened, as did formal collaborations with employer and management groups.\n\nBy 1966, nearly 1,300 students from trade union and business management backgrounds were learning together at the re-branded National College of Industrial Relations (NCIR).\n\nIn 1976 the college achieved recognition by the states National Council for Educational Awards (NCEA), the forerunner of HETAC, for a number of its programmes.\n\nThe college again re-branded as the National College of Ireland (NCI) in 1998, with an expanded National Campus Network, and an array of outreach programmes across the country.\n\nAs the College continued to grow, the land and buildings at Sandford Road were transferred by the Jesuits to the NCI Board of Management.\n\nThe College's Higher Certificate, Bachelor, Higher Diploma, and Master courses are accredited by the Irish government's Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) ; a number of other short term courses are unaccredited.\n\nAt the turn of the century, NCI relocated to a 0.8 hectare site on Mayor Street in the Dublin Docklands. A €25,000,000 fundraising campaign resulted in the development of a modern campus including 53 residential apartments accommodating 286 students and a new Business and Research Building.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010 the College ran a series of free debates called the \"Insight Debate Series\", organised in partnership with The Irish Times and the radio station Newstalk 106-108 FM. The college's \"Legends in your Lunchtime\" series saw public figures such as Ben Dunne, Willie Walsh and Giovanni Trapattoni interviewed live by a Newstalk presenter .

Born in Limassol on 1.10.1937, where he lived his early years. His family then moved to Famagusta and he graduated from the Gymnasium of Famagusta with distinction and being awarded the Palamas Prize. Working for a short time at the Board of Commerce, he then went to England where he studied law and was called to the Bar (Lincoln´s). From 1961 he practiced law in Nicosia. On 10.9.1971 he was appointed Judge of the District Court of Famagusta, subsequently serving at the District Court of Nicosia (from 10.9.1973). On 10.10.1980 he was appointed Senior District Judge and on 1.1.1982 President of District Court, serving at the District Court of Nicosia and (from 1.9.1987) at the District Court of Larnaca-Famagusta. On 19.11.1988 he was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court. He left the Court on 30.4.2003, upon his appointment as Attorney-General. He resigned from that position in May 2005 in connection with a judgment of the Supreme Court, considering, as he stated in his announcement, that the case “is inextricably interwoven with the very essence of the administration of justice, the principles of the rule of law and the democratic principle of the separation of powers. It is also related to the existence, the endurance and the quality of institutions in a free and democratic society”.\n\nHe was elected as a member of the council of the Commonwealth Magistrates and Judges Association (CMJA) in 1994 and as a Regional Vice-President for the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Region of the CMJA in 1997. As Regional Vice-President he organised the very successful follow-up conference on the Latimer House Guidelines in Larnaca in October 1988 on \"The Role of the Judiciary in Developing and maintaining a vibrant human rights environment in the Commonwealth\". He participated in many conferences all over the world and gave lectures and speeches on several legal subjects during his long and distinguished legal and judicial career.Inspired by intense democratic convictions, he was a founding and acting member of the Organisation for the Restoration of Democracy in Greece.\n\n", "id": "7717940", "categories": ["1937 births", "Cypriot lawyers", "2005 deaths"], "title": "Solon Nikitas"}

The United States House Committee on Appropriations has joint jurisdiction with the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations over all appropriations bills in the United States Congress. Each committee has 12 matching subcommittees, each of which is tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills. This subcommittee has jurisdiction over the budgets for the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Justice, and Science policy of the United States.\n\nTraditionally, after a federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year has been passed, the appropriations subcommittees receive information about what the budget sets as their spending ceilings. This is called \"302(b) allocations\" after section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. That amount is separated into smaller amounts for each of the twelve Subcommittees. The federal budget does not become law and is not signed by the President. Instead, it is guide for the House and the Senate in making appropriations and tax decisions. However, no budget is required and each chamber has procedures in place for what to do without one. The House and Senate now consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.\n\nAn appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The \"fiscal year\" is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. \n\nThere are three types of appropriations bills: regular appropriations bills, continuing resolutions, and supplemental appropriations bills. Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for the federal government for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1. If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time, it can pass a continuing resolution, which continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time. The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills, which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief. \n\nAppropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. Article One of the United States Constitution, section 9, clause 7, states that \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.\n\nThe Subcommittee has jurisdiction over the budgets of the Departments of Commerce and Justice and several independent agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\n", "id": "7717950", "categories": ["Subcommittees of the United States House of Representatives"], "title": "United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies"}

It was originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 2005 and 2008. The show stars James Fleet as Duncan Stonebridge, a Labour Member of Parliament for the imaginary Rothershurst, which appears to be a marginal constituency in the north of England, one which was traditionally Conservative but turned Labour under Tony Blair. In line with the national trend, the elections of 2005 saw Stonebridge's majority reduced to 27. Stonebridge is a Londoner and, according to his constituency agent Roger (Geoffrey McGivern), was \"parachuted in by RAF Millbank\".\n\nThe show follows the everyday life of the MP. Each episode begins and concludes with Stonebridge travelling on the train from London, and a short, witty dialogue between Stonebridge and a railway attendant. Most episodes then revolve around Stonebridge's attempt to gain publicity in his constituency, ultimately being thwarted by an unlikely twist of fate or bad luck. Stonebridge finds it difficult to fill the shoes of his predecessor, Sir Digby, whose name still looms large in the shape of his widow, Lady Harriet (Geraldine McNulty). In the third series, Harriet becomes Duncan's constituency secretary. He also struggles to keep one step ahead of Angela, his image-conscious and media savvy Conservative rival. It is an ongoing joke that he is secretly attracted to Angela.\n\nThe middle of each show features Stonebridge's constituency surgery, dealing with problems from constituents of variable sanity, including Mrs Digweed, who insists the constituency needs a badger tunnel, and doesn't believe he's doing enough to get this discussed in Parliament.\n\nOther characters include Jane (Rachel Atkins), Duncan's long-suffering sister, and the other members of the constituency team, the aggressive Ruth and the geeky Neil. Various characters are played by Simon Greenall, Beth Chalmers, Manjit Mann and Dan Mersh.\n\nThe show was typically written and produced only 24 hours before it was broadcast, so it sometimes contained references to current events.\n\n", "id": "7717976", "categories": ["BBC Radio comedy programmes", "BBC Radio 4 programmes"], "title": "The Party Line (radio)"}

This species' range is further north than the other Mexican species. This bird was formerly known as Coues' flycatcher.\n\nThis species is slightly longer than the olive-sided flycatcher. The adult greater pewee is the largest breeding \"Contopus\" flycatcher to breed in the U.S. It is a dull gray-brown bird all over with some birds that have a buff wash on the breast. They have indistinct wingbars and a very distinct crest. The lower mandible is bright orange and that is an easy way to distinguish them from olive-sided flycatchers in eastern Arizona and west central New Mexico. They are 8 inches (20.3 cm) long, have a 13 in (33 cm) wingspan and weigh 1 oz. (28 g).\n\nThese birds love to stay high in trees scanning for insects. They sally and hawk insects from their high perches. The greater pewee defends its nesting grounds aggressively. They will attack hawks, jays and squirrels. Their diet consists of insects and maybe berries in cooler months. Their song is a whistled five syllables: \"deelip deeree! ah\" or famously known as \"jose maria\". The opening \"deelip\" is repeated several times before the rest of the song. It also gives \"pip\" calls like the olive-sided flycatcher.\n\nThe greater pewee prefers montane pine forests with an oak understory. Also found in montane deciduous especially Arizona sycamore forests and mixed montane oak-pine forest. They are found more easily in elevations over 6,500 feet in Arizona and New Mexico. They are rare in western Texas.\n\nThe greater pewee is found year-round in central and southern Mexico south through Costa Rica and Nicaragua. It breeds from central Mexico north to southeast and central Arizona and southwest New Mexico. Rarely does it reach southern California, southern Nevada or western Texas.\n\nThe female builds the nest high in a horizontal fork of a conifer. The nest is compact and attached by cobwebs. It is made of grass and weeds and is decorated with lichen. The nest is usually lined with fine grasses. The female lays three or four creamy white eggs sparsely marked with or wreathed with browns and olive. The eggs are 0.8 in (21 mm).\n", "id": "7717977", "categories": ["Birds of the United States", "Birds of Guatemala", "Birds of El Salvador", "Birds of Belize", "Birds of Central America", "Birds of Honduras", "Birds of Mexico", "Birds of Nicaragua", "Contopus"], "title": "Greater pewee"}

He is the uncle of professional basketball player Karl-Anthony Towns, who currently plays on the Minnesota Timberwolves, of the NBA.\n\nFerreira was born in the\ntown of Amaceyes Tamboril, near Santiago in the Cibao region of the north-western Dominican Republic. The region is famous for \"merengue périco ripiao\", the traditional Dominican music, and his family, all big music lovers, filled his childhood home with the music spurring Zacarías on to dream of becoming a musical artist himself.\n\nThe desire to improve himself motivated him to leave for the country’s capital, Santo Domingo, where he joined the \"Conservatorio Nacional\" and also sang in a local bachata group.\n\nFerreira then became a member of the Brugal rum company orchestra, where he remained for five years. His debut album, \"Me Liberé\", was released in 1998 and won the prestigious Dominican music award, the Cassandra. Two years later his second album, \"El Triste\", won the award for him for a second time.\n\nIn the winter of 2001, Ferreira traveled to the United States for the first time and played 77 gigs in just six-and-a-half weeks in New York City.\n\nAugust 17, 2010 Zacarías Ferreira inaugurated Escuela Primaria de Amaceyes Arriba, which he built with his longtime friend Elvis Jesús Rodríguez.\n\n1.

In 1831, at the age of 17, he travelled to Paris to study art under Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, becoming one of his most accomplished pupils and a close associate for many years. His first exhibition was at the Salon in 1835 where he won a second-class medal. Thereafter he exhibited regularly at the Salon, winning first-class medals in 1840, 1848 and 1855.\nLehmann lived in Rome from 1838–41, where he continued his artistic education with Ingres (who was by then Director of the Académie de France there), and collaborated with him on some works—including Ingres' painting \"\". In Rome Lehmann befriended Franz Liszt and his lover, the author Marie d'Agoult, corresponding with them for many years and painting portraits of them.\n\nLehmann settled permanently in Paris in 1842. He was awarded many commissions for large-scale public works, such as at the Hôtel de Ville, the Church of Ste-Clothilde, the Palais du Luxembourg, the Palais de Justice, and the Chapel of the Jeunes Aveugles in the Church of Saint-Merri on Rue Saint-Martin.\n\nHe went on to paint portraits of many well-known and distinguished people of the day including Charles Gounod, Victor Cousin, Liszt, Chopin, Stendhal, the Princess Christina Belgiojoso and many others.\n\nIn 1846 Lehmann received the Légion d'honneur and in 1847 became a French citizen, opening his studio in that same year. In 1861 he became a teacher at the famous École des Beaux-Arts and was appointed Professor in 1875. He founded the Lehmann Prize to recognise academic excellence in art. In 1864 he was elected a member of the Institut de France.\n\nHe died in Paris in 1882. His brother Rudolf Lehmann was also a well-known portrait artist.\n\n\nLehmann was a painter of portraits, religious, genre, historical, allegorical and literary works. He drew inspiration from classical mythology, Shakespeare and contemporary writers. Sometimes considered dry and academic, the best of his work can be both pure in line and graceful in form. Among the best of his canvases are:\n\n\nMural paintings include those in the chapels of the church of St. Merry, on the ceiling of the Great Hall in the Palais de Justice, and in the Throne Hall, Luxembourg Palace. He painted many well-characterized portraits of celebrated contemporaries—Liszt, Ingres, Marie d'Agoult, Chopin, and Edmond About amongst others.

Some derived it from the Greek verb (\"ozein\") which means \"to smell\". According to Strabo, this version could be explained by the stench arising from a spring at the foot of Mount Taphiassus, beneath which Nessus and other centaurs had been buried, while according to Plutarch, that was due to the asphodel which scented the air. For the first of these two versions, Pausanias said that, as he had heard, Nessus, ferrying on Evenus, was wounded by Heracles but not killed on the spot, making him escape to this country and when he died, his body rotted unburied, imparting a stench to the atmosphere of the place. Other variations about the origin of the name from the above verb that Pausanias included in his work \"Description of Greece\" are: a) that the exhalations of a river had a peculiar smell and b) that the first dwellers of the region did not know how to weave garments so they wore untanned skins which were smelly.\n\nAnother version mentioned by Pausanias was that Orestheus, son of Deucalion, king of the land, had a bitch which gave birth to a stick instead of a puppy and Orestheus buried it from which a vine grew in the spring, and from its branches called (\"ozoi\") in Greek, the people got their name.\n\nOzolian Locris is mountainous and for the most part unproductive. The declivities of Mount Parnassus from Phocis on the east, Aselinon oros in the centre and Mount Corax from Aetolia on the west, occupy the greater part of it. The only rivers whose names are mentioned in antiquity are Hylaethus and Daphnus, the latter is nowadays called Mornos, which runs in a southwesterly direction, and flows into the Corinthian gulf near Naupactus. The frontier of the Ozolian Locrians on the west was close to the promontory Antirrhium, opposite the promontory Rhium on the coast of Achaea. The eastern frontier of Locris, on the coast, was close to the Phocian town of Crissa; and the Crissaean gulf washed on its western side the Locrian, and on its eastern the Phocian coast. Ozolian Locris is said to have been a colony from the Opuntian Locrians.\n\nThe chief town of the Ozolians was Amphissa and their most important port Naupactus. Other important towns of the region were: the coastal town of Chalaeum, on the west of the modern town Itea, Myonia and Tritaea on the foot of Aselinon oros southwest of Amphissa, on the western slope of Parnassus the towns Ipnus, Hessus and Messapia, the coastal town Oeantheia on the western edge of the Crissaean gulf and farther on the west Phaestus, Tolophon, Anticirrha, Erythrae, Eupalium, Oeneon, Macynia and Molycreio which owned Antirrhium. More inland from west to east, were Aegitium, Croculeium, Teichium, Olpae and Hyle.\n\nThey first appear in history in the time of the Peloponnesian War, when they are mentioned by Thucydides as a semi-barbarous nation, along with the Aetolians and Acarnanians, whom they resembled in their armour and mode of fighting. In 426 BCE, the Locrians promised to assist Demosthenes, the Athenian commander, in his invasion of Aetolia; but, after the defeat of Demosthenes, most of the Locrian tribes submitted without opposition to Spartan Eurylochus, who marched through their territory from Delphi to Naupactus. They belonged at a later period to the Aetolian League.\n\n\n", "id": "7717985", "categories": ["Ozolian Locris", "Peloponnesian War"], "title": "Ozolian Locris"}

Heggs was most recently manager at Hinckley United, having originally joined the club as an assistant in the summer of 2012, before resigning in May 2013. Heggs was forced out of retirement towards the end of November 2012 as Hinckley United were short for players. He was also the caretaker manager of League One side Notts County after Paul Ince was sacked in 2011.\n\nHeggs started his professional career in 1991 with Midlands side, West Bromwich Albion following a £25,000 move from his local side Leicester United. After progressing through the reserve team, Heggs managed to force his way in the first team setup, in which he would go on to spend four seasons with the club. Heggs made 40 appearances and found the net on three occasions for the Baggies.\n\nAfter losing his place in the first team, Heggs was seeking a return to regular first team football and joined Bristol Rovers for the later part of the 1995 season. Heggs made five appearances and scoring one goal.\n\nCarl moved away from West Bromwich Albion on 27 July 1995 and joined Swansea City for a fee of £60,000. Heggs spent two seasons with the club making 43 appearances and scoring seven goals.\n\nOn 1 August 1997, Heggs make the return north to join Northampton Town for £25,000, having been on the losing side against the Cobblers in the Division Three play-off final three months earlier. Heggs spent just over one season with the Cobblers, making 49 appearances and scoring six goals, but he would team up with manager Ian Atkins again elsewhere.\n\nHeggs signed for Rushden & Diamonds in October 1998, in a joint deal with teammate Ray Warburton worth a reported £100,000. He scored on his debut against Morecambe, but after that found goals hard to come by scoring only five in his 49 games for the club.\n\nThe undoubted highlight of Heggs' spell at Rushden was scoring the opening goal in a 3–1 FA Cup Third Round Replay defeat to Premiership side Leeds United at Elland Road.\n\nHeggs was unusually loaned from a non-League club to a Football League club when he joined Chester City in March 2000, as he teamed up again with Ian Atkins. However, the Blues were in grave danger of losing their league status when Heggs arrived. He quickly struck up an effective partnership with Luke Beckett, which proved particularly successful in a 5–0 win over Mansfield Town, but it was not enough to avert relegation and Heggs moved on.\n\nOn 28 July 2000, Heggs joined Third Division side Carlisle United on a two-year contract. However, he only spent one season with the club, making 30 appearances and scoring five goals in the process as the side narrowly avoided relegation from Football League under Ian Atkins.\n\nHeggs signed for Conference National side Forest Green Rovers in 2001 playing under former England international Nigel Spink. He spent a season at the non league side making just under 40 appearances before moving on to Ilkeston Town.\n\nOn 1 June 2005, Heggs joined Staffordshire side Tamworth of the Conference National. His time at Tamworth saw him involved in two notable goals. A 25-yard screamer against Halifax Town, in a 2–1 defeat and a powerful and determined run through the heart of the Stoke City defence, laying off a perfect pass for Nathan Jackson to slot into the empty net for the opening goal of the replay, however, Tamworth lost the game on penalties after drawing 1–1 in normal time.\n\nHe was even subject of a move during his time with Tamworth, but opted to turn down a move to Hucknall Town on 1 March 2006 to help Tamworth's fight against relegation. During his time with the club Heggs made 25 appearances and scored four goals.\n\nHeggs joined Hinckley United on 10 July 2006, with the chance of regular first team football being the major factor in his decision. Heggs, however, found that his first team promise wasn't quite as true as he was led to believe and after spending more time on the bench and out of the team than he had wished for he left after just less than six months with the club.\n\nOn 22 May 2007, Heggs re-joined Tamworth, stating that he was delighted to be back at club.\n\nAfter just six appearances on his return to the club, Heggs was released after the management could not guarantee first team football.\n\nHeggs re-joined Redditch United for his second spell on 17 October 2007 and was appointed as the club's player-coach.\n\nHeggs rejoined former team Hinckley United for the second time in February 2010.\n\nIn August 2011, Heggs signed along with Jon Stevenson and Matt Piper, both formerly of Leicester City, for East Midlands Counties Football League side Oadby Town.\n\nHeggs was appointed manager of King's Lynn on 1 June 2009. This was ended as the club were wound up by the HMRC.\n\nFollowing his second spell, as a player, at Hinckley United, Heggs was appointed as Chief Scout at Notts County. On 3 April 2011, Heggs was appointed caretaker manager at Notts County for two matches.\n\nOn 3 June 2012, Heggs was appointed assistant manager of Hinckley United, replacing Marc Faulkner for the 2012–2013 season. Heggs is highly regarded as having excellent knowledge of local football players in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. After Hinckley United manager Dean Thomas resigned on 10 October 2012 following an early F.A Cup exit and a poor start to the Conference North league campaign, Heggs was put in caretaker charge of the football club alongside Neil Lyne. He also \"threw his hat into the ring for the manager's position on a permanent basis\", according to a club statement. On Thursday, 15 November, Heggs was offered the manager's job on a permanent basis until the end of the 2012-2013 season. Heggs later accepted the offer. Heggs came out of retirement on 19 November for a game against Bradford PA with Hinckley United desperate for players.\n\nHegg's got his first win in charge of Hinckley United on 4 December in a Westerby Challenge Cup Round One game against St Andrews. The game finished 2-1 with goals from Jack Lane and a header from Aron Wint. On 28 February 2013, it was announced in the Hinckley Times that Heggs had signed a new contract until the end of the 2013-2014 season after being given the assurances he was looking for from the board. On 8 April 2013 Hegg's finally got his first league victory since taking charge of Hinckley United with a 6-3 win against Corby Town; a hat-trick from Luke Richards, and goals from Jack Lane, Harvey Headley and Liam Canavan gave the Knitters just their second league win of the season. On 21 May, Heggs announced his intention to resign as manager of Hinckley United to become a PE teacher at Ascot College, Derbyshire.\n", "id": "7718046", "categories": ["Association football forwards", "Rushden &amp; Diamonds F.C. players", "Tamworth F.C. players", "Sportspeople from Leicester", "1970 births", "Living people", "Notts County F.C. managers", "English Football League players", "Oadby Town F.C. players", "English footballers", "National League (English football) players", "Carlisle United F.C. players", "Hinckley United F.C. players", "Chester City F.C. players", "Swansea City A.F.C. players", "King's Lynn F.C. managers", "Redditch United F.C. players", "Bristol Rovers F.C. players", "West Bromwich Albion F.C. players", "Northampton Town F.C. players", "Ilkeston Town F.C.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7718117", "text": "Associationalism\n\nAssociationalism or associative democracy is a political movement in which \"human welfare and liberty are both best served when as many of the affairs of a society as possible are managed by voluntary and democratically self-governing associations.\" Associationalism \"gives priority to freedom in its scale of values, but it contends that such freedom can only be pursued effectively if individuals join with their fellows\"\n\nAssociationalism is a European political theory, stemming from 19th and early 20th century social and political theorists from the continent. In France, such political thinkers as de Tocqueville, Proudhon, Durkheim, and Duguit. In England, such pluralists as Cole, Figgis, Laski, Barker, and Maitland. The theory provides an alternative to the previously popular doctrines of state-centered and collectivist ideals which had all but dominated twentieth-century politics: Western social democracy and Eastern bloc Marxist–Leninism.\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville's idea of associationalism “...stressed volunteerism, community spirit and independent associational life as protections against the domination of society by the state, and indeed as a counterbalance which helped to keep the state accountable and effective”. In Tocqueville’s vision then, economic freedom fosters greed, which engenders political apathy, which results in excessive individualism and passive reliance on the state. This political apathy will in turn result in the almost inevitable growth of government if left unchecked by associationalism. Thus, Tocqueville predicted that “It is easy to see the time coming in which men will be less and less able to produce, by each alone, the commonest bare necessities of life. The tasks of government must therefore perpetually increase, and its efforts to cope with them must spread its net ever wider. The more government takes the place of associations, the more will individuals lose the idea of forming associations and need the government to come to their help. That is a vicious cycle of cause and effect”.\n\nAssociational democracy is, in essence, both a political structure and system of relations with the goal of easing pluralist social negotiation and priorities. It became an important aspect of public policy, countering previous laissez-faire traditions. Critics considered laissez-faire, which essentially equated to liberal individualism, as not conducive to the fostering of upward mobility in society. Associationalism, as opposed to liberal individualism, embodies a deliberate commitment to social cooperation as well as public well-being.\n\"Association...grew out of a sense of difference; for the middle class, it meant crossing class lines to bring together people of diverse identities and conditions\". According to David Lewis, during the late 19th and early 20th century the new middle class required “...sanctioned private accumulation underwritten by a state which maintained legal order and stability\"· As a result, the state needed to become powerful enough to maintain order, but not so strong as to become oppressive; neither laissez-faire nor statist. Finding this balance between transgressing autonomy and dangerous accumulation of power could prove difficult, and associationalism appeared to be a possible solution.\nAssociationalism brought together several political ideologies which, until its conception, were frequently at odds: pluralism, socialism, and cooperative mutualism. It provides for a pluralist rather than a statist or constraining collectivist socialism, yet it also provides for a mutualist and cooperative pluralism. This, as opposed to pluralism which reacts so far to statist communitarianism that it slides into an unrestricted competitive asociality.\n\nUrban politics in late 19th century America proved an ideal situation for the emergence of associationalism, ripe with several qualifications discussed by early associationalists. In addition, voter turnout was relatively high, though usually confined to party lines. Despite this fact, the two large national parties at the time (Democrats and Republicans) lacked significant ideological differences on specific issues. Respected members of communities across the country began to propose associationalism as a solution to America's social political problems. Several Protestant ministers such as Lyman Abbot, Washington Gladden, Josiah Strong, and Walter Raushenbusch began to call for a “social gospel.” “The next great principle,” Rauschenbusch proclaimed in 1896, “is association”. These growing political currents in favor of associationalism perhaps culminated when voters elected William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, a left statist associationalist who would become president shortly thereafter, in 1900.\n\n“Associationalism is fundamentally about collective governance – about the legal constitution of groups and bodies politic and the rules and bylaws that regulate the interrelationships of members”. During the early 20th century Congress passed a great deal of “protective legislation,” which was, in essence, legislated associationalism. Labor received improved work conditions resulting in fewer work-related injuries. Wages were increased while hours were decreased. In addition, probably the most important protective legislation pertained to the legal establishment and organization of large labor unions.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, employer costs went up resulting in outsourcing and decreased cash flow into such areas as research and development, slowing technological progress. Fewer hours and the fact that labor was more organized (allowing for an increase in strikes and protests) resulted in less production. Finally, such strong government influence over labor could lead to an abuse of power, favoring certain unions. The results of these legislated regulations suggested to critics that associationalism tends to benefit labor (the \"people”) directly at the cost of both corporate management and technological progress.\n\n Theodore Roosevelt (President 1901-1908) was the first true champion of American associationalism as evidenced by his intervention into the United Mine Workers strike of 1902. For the first time representatives from government, labor, and management met collectively and were able to resolve the conflict. When management was uncooperative, Roosevelt threatened to employ the military on behalf of labor to arrive at a resolution.\n\nInstead, a five-member commission was established to communicate with the company management. Also, wages were increased by ten percent and the length of the work day was cut from ten hours to nine, keeping union membership sound. By demonstrating a new role for the state in such conflicts (aside from the previously held military positions) associationalism took root in American society and politics, and there wasn't another major coal strike in the country until the 1920s.\n\nWoodrow Wilson (President 1913-1920), a regulatory liberal, employed associationalism during World War I to control and regulate capital, ensuring a steady flow of war supplies while minimizing the risk of breaks in manufacturing vital to the war effort. The establishment of such government agencies as the National War Labor Board were instrumental in preventing strikes and ensuring collective bargaining. In addition, Wilson appointed the country's first Secretary of Labor that was pro labor (William B. Wilson). The policies were implemented as America successfully met its goals in wartime production. There were nearly no strikes, many companies saw enormous profits, and the Allies won the war.\n\n\n", "id": "7718117", "categories": ["Political theories"], "title": "Associationalism"}

The lymph system depends on intrinsic contractions of the smooth muscle cells in the walls of lymph vessels (peristalsis) and the movement of skeletal muscles to propel lymph through the vessels to lymph nodes and then to the lymph ducts which return lymph to the cardiovascular system. Manual lymph drainage uses a specific amount of pressure (less than 9 ounces per square inch or about 4 kPa) and rhythmic circular movements to stimulate lymph flow. Clinical studies of MLD conclude that further study of the practice is required before recommending it as an effective health treatment.\n\nManual lymphatic drainage was pioneered by Danish Drs. Emil Vodder and Estrid Vodder in the 1930s for the treatment of chronic sinusitis and other immune disorders. While working on the French Riviera treating patients with chronic colds, the Vodders noticed these patients had swollen lymph nodes. In the 1930s, the lymphatic system was poorly understood. The Vodders were not deterred by this and, in 1932, began to study the lymph system, developing light, rhythmic hand movements to promote lymph movement. In 1936, they introduced this technique in Paris, France, and after World War II, they returned to Copenhagen to teach other practitioners to use this therapy.\n\nTherapists can today receive certification through special classes conducted by various organizations specializing in MLD, or through a complete lymphedema treatment certification course. Scientific studies show mixed results regarding the efficacy of the method in treating lymphedema and further studies are needed. A 2013 systematic review of manual lymphatic drainage with regard to breast cancer related lymphedema found no clear support for the effectiveness of the intervention in either preventing limb edema in at-risk women or treating women for the condition.\n\n", "id": "7718201", "categories": ["Alternative medical systems"], "title": "Manual lymphatic drainage"}

La Navidad was the first European colony established in the New World during the Age of Discovery, though it was destroyed by the following year.\n\nColumbus sailed around the island of Hispaniola on Christmas Eve of 1492, during his first voyage. One of his ships, the Santa María, drifted onto a bank and heeled over. After hearing from Guacanagari that there was much gold to be had on the island, Columbus decided that he would leave the crew of his wrecked vessel to make a settlement on the island and gather the promised gold. He ordered the ship dismantled to provide the building materials for a small fortress:\n\n\"I have ordered a tower and fortress to be constructed and, a large cellar, not because I believe there is any necessity on account of [the natives],\" he noted in his journal. \"I am certain the people I have with me could subjugate all this island… as the population are naked and without arms and very cowardly.\"\n\nColumbus called the port \"Puerto de la Navidad\" (\"Christmas Port\"), the day he landed there. He appointed Diego de Arana, chief constable of the fleet and son of Rodrigo, Pedro Gutiérrez, butler of the Spanish royal dais, and Rodrigo de Escobedo to govern the fortress of 36 men. They included carpenters, calkers, a physician, a tailor, and a gunner. Additionally, the settlement was supplied with provisions, trading goods, arms and artillery.\n\nOn Friday, 4 January 1493, Columbus set sail in the \"Niña\" in search of the third ship in the fleet, the \"Pinta\". The \"Pinta\" was commanded by Martín Alonzo Pinzón, and had been absent for six weeks. On the night of 21 November, the caravel \"Pinta\" had vanished into the darkness off the coast of Cuba, and in his journal Columbus accused Pinzón of deliberately having separated the \"Pinta\" from the other ships in order to beat the admiral to the rich sources of gold which Columbus imagined were in the immediate area. Even more disquieting was his fear that Pinzón might break for Spain in the fast-sailing \"Pinta\" to be the first to bring news of the discovery to the Catholic Monarchs and to \"tell them lies\" about the admiral's conduct of the expedition. On Sunday morning, 6 January 1493, the missing \"Pinta\" was spotted approaching from the east, and after a heated argument between the two men, the fleet returned to gather people and supplies for a return voyage.\n\nWhen Columbus returned to Navidad on 27 Nov 1493, his second voyage from Spain, he \"found it burned to the ground . . . nobody in the vicinity.\" In the fields nearby, however, he discovered the \"bodies of eight Christians.\" Columbus later discovered that, soon after his departure, his \"men began to quarrel among themselves, each taking as many women and as much gold as he could.\" Gutiérrez and Escobedo left with nine others, along with their women, for the gold mines. However, the \"lord of the mines\" turned, killed them and then marched back to Navidad, defended by Arana with ten others, and Guacanagari. Caonabo set fire to houses, forcing Columbus' men into the sea, where eight drowned, and three were killed onshore.\n\nColumbus decided to build a settlement further east in present-day Dominican Republic and named it La Isabela after Queen Isabella I.\n\nAfter Columbus sailed away a second time, the site apparently was forgotten until a Haitian farmer led Dr. William Hodges to a location in 1977. Hodges, an amateur archaeologist and American medical missionary, received permission from the Haitian government to excavate a tennis-court-size section of the marshland, and he and his helpers found some artifacts of La Navidad. Despite the finds however, no conclusive evidence has been discovered yet to pinpoint the exact location of La Navidad.\n\n", "id": "7718226", "categories": ["Populated places in Haiti", "Former Spanish colonies", "1490s in the Spanish West Indies", "Spanish West Indies", "1492 establishments in North America", "History of the Colony of Santo Domingo", "1493 disestablishments", "Populated places established in the 1490s", "History of Haiti", "1490s in the Caribbean"], "title": "La Navidad"}

He also raised forces which served in the Seven Years' War against the French in Quebec, as well as the American War of Independence. Simon was the 19th Chief of the Clan Fraser of Lovat.\nSimon's mother was Margaret Grant, and his father Simon \"the Fox\" Fraser, Lord Lovat, chief of the Clan Fraser. As the first born boy (after several sisters) he was his father's heir, and hence the Master of Lovat. He grew up in the ancestral home of Castle Dounie, near Beauly, and was educated in Edinburgh and St Andrew's University.\n\nSimon 'would not have had any concern in this rebellion, had he been entirely left to himself', according to one of his father's secretaries of the period. This was confirmed by another, who noted that his father was a 'very strict man' with great power over his children. So, at his father's bidding, Simon led his clansmen out in favour of Charles Edward Stuart in December 1745. \n\nHe was not present at the battle of Culloden. Instead, Charles Fraser of Inverallochy commanded about 300 Frasers, who were in the front of the Jacobite lines and reached the British front line after a short charge. However, confronted with a second line of Hanoverian troops, their impetus was lost and they retreated in some disorder, leaving many dead and wounded behind. \n\nThere are various stories about the Master of Lovat at this moment in history. One traditional story is that, as the first of the Jacobites fleeing from Culloden approached Inverness, they were met by a battalion of Frasers led by the Master of Lovat. He immediately about-turned his men and marched down the road back towards Inverness, with pipes playing and colours. A second story is that he intended to hold the bridge which spans the river Ness until he was persuaded against it. In a third account, recounted in 'The Last Highlander' by Sarah Fraser, he intended to continue on to the fight at Culloden moor but was scolded at the bridge by another Jacobite by the name of Evan Baillie: 'Fighting, by God, Master! You were not in the way when fighting might have been of service. You had best say nothing of it now'. \nFollowing the Battle of Culloden, after several weeks on the run, Simon surrendered to the Crown and was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle from November 1746 to August 1747. He then remained in Glasgow ‘at the king’s pleasure’ where he studied law at Glasgow University.\n\nSimon received a full pardon in 1750, the same year he was called to the Scottish bar. He burnished his establishment credentials by acting in 1752 as a counsel for the widow of Colin Roy Campbell against James Stewart in a notorious case known as the Appin Murder. Stewart was a member of the local Jacobite clan the Stewarts of Appin, who had recently suffered evictions on Campbell's orders. Stewart was found guilty of aiding and abetting by a jury composed largely of Campbells (the presiding judge was the Campbell chief) and Stewart was hanged.\n\nIn 1753 he offered himself as a candidate for the forthcoming general election for Inverness-shire (which had a total of about 26 electors) but the 3rd Duke of Argyll, worried this might reignite feelings of clanship, persuaded Fraser not to stand.\n\nBritain’s war with France in North America raised problems of recruitment, and more in ‘desperation’ than inspiration, the government decided to recruit soldiers from the Highlands. Simon, whose hereditary title had been attainted following the Forty-Five, raised 800 men from the forfeited estate of his own family within a few weeks. He was commissioned as a lieutenant-colonel, and the regiment, originally called the 78th Regiment of Foot, was soon renamed the Fraser Highlanders.The uniform of the regiment was the full Highland dress, with musket and broadsword... and a sporran of badger's or otter's skin. An eagle's or hawk's feather was worn in their bonnets by the officers, while the soldiers ornamented theirs' with a bunch of the distinguishing mark of the clan or district to which they severally belonged.The regiment were sent to North America in 1757, and wintered in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Here, Fraser fended off an attempt by his superiors to make the soldiers wear clothing thought more appropriate for the severe winters and hot summers of the continent. Their unique national dress even enhanced their fighting qualities, with one officer noting that alongside their bravery and their agility, 'their dress contribute to adapt them to this climate, and render them formidable'.\n\nThey fought with distinction against the French at the siege of Louisbourg in 1758 (under the command of General Wolfe), at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759, and at the capture of Montreal a year later.\n\nIn 1762 Fraser left his regiment to serve in Portugal, where he reached the temporary rank of major-general in command of Portuguese forces against the Spanish. The following year his regiment was disbanded whilst still in Canada and he was put on half-pay.\n\nAt the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775, General Fraser raised another regiment of two battalions, known as the 71st Regiment of Foot (informally known as the Fraser Highlanders), although he did not accompany them to North America.\n\nIn April 1761, the Duke of Argyll (who had opposed Fraser's standing for election) died. The next month Fraser was elected unopposed to the House of Commons seat of Inverness-shire, one day after his return from North America. He was re-elected three times, and remained a representative until his death. This is despite often being absent from the seat. A history of the House of Commons for this period notes 'a brief visit' in 1766, as well as his absence in Portugal in 1768. Indeed, he may have been the British Ambassador there in this period, since another source states he was representing the British Government in Lisbon in 1770.\n\nIn 1774 the Lovat estates were restored to him (but not the title). This was a full decade before other forfeited estates were restored, and was a measure of Fraser's service for the Crown. He nevertheless felt proud of his Scottish identity. In 1778, he was the founding member and first president of the Highland Society of London. Its overall aim was to 'promote the Interests of the Highlands', with its particular goals being to repeal the ban on Highland dress being worn, the promotion of Gaelic language, music and literature, establishing schools, agricultural improvement, the relief of distressed Highlanders, and 'keeping up the Martial Spirit; and rewarding the gallant achievements of the Highland Corps'. His half brother Archibald joined the Society in the same year.\n\nFraser married Catherine Bristow, but they had no children together. He died in London in 1782 at the age of 56. His later life was marked by social respectability, albeit with some debt to his name. His half-brother, Archibald Campbell Fraser of Lovat, succeeded him as the 20th MacShimidh, or Chief of Clan Fraser.\n\nSimon Fraser appears twice in fiction, but each time in an unflattering light. He is a character in the novel Catriona written in 1893 by Robert Louis Stevenson. (Events and characters in the novel relate to the Appin Murder). He also features as a character in Diana Gabaldon's 1992 novel \"Dragonfly in Amber\", the second novel in her \"Outlander\" series. In it, Lovat is the uncle of Jamie Fraser. Lovat is played by James Parris in series 2 of the television series \"Outlander\".\n\nThe image of Fraser above may actually be of his half-brother, Archibald. This is discussed at length on Archibald's Wikipedia page.\n\nPiebracht, Lord Lovat's Lament\n\n", "id": "7718240", "categories": ["Clan Fraser", "1782 deaths", "British Army generals", "British Army personnel of the American Revolutionary War", "British MPs 1761–68", "1726 births", "People of the Jacobite rising of 1745", "British MPs 1780–84", "Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Scottish constituencies", "78th Fraser Highlanders officers", "British MPs 1774–80", "British MPs 1768–74", "British military personnel of the French and Indian War"], "title": "Simon Fraser of Lovat"}

In the process, Fleishman earned a reputation not only as one of the pioneers of public relations, but also as an author, educator, humanitarian, and champion of the state of Israel.\n\nA native of St. Louis, Missouri, Fleishman was born June 16, 1905, and studied at the St. Louis College of Pharmacy, before being inducted into the U.S. Army. As a major in the U.S. Army Air Corps, he spent World War II primarily as a Pentagon-based public information officer. He traveled to war-torn Germany in October 1945. Sent by the American Jewish Congress as a special consultant to the Secretary of Defense, he headed a survey committee that studied the psychological, economic and social needs of displaced people in Germany and Austria.\n\nIn that capacity, he was an early eyewitness to the horrors of the Holocaust, and his research and subsequent report alerted many organizations in the United States to the forgotten people of World War II – the displaced Jews. Upon completion of his report, Fleishman made a 60-city U.S. lecture tour, discussing these refugees’ relief and rehabilitation needs. The trip influenced his life as he became deeply involved in various Jewish causes and with minority affairs. A longtime member of the Assembly of the Jewish Agency in Israel, Fleishman made 57 visits to Israel between 1955 and 1997, becoming a personal friend of many of the founders and leaders of the state.\n\nAfter completing his military duty, Fleishman was awarded the Legion of Merit for his services in the rehabilitation of World War II combat casualties and amputees. Among his accomplishments in that role was putting together a widely distributed publication called “Coming Home.” He also received the Americanism Medal from the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n\nUpon his return from Europe in 1946, Fleishman wasted no time in forming his business partnership with Bob Hillard. The two had known each other for more than a decade, dating back to when Fleishman had served as chief deputy to the city’s circuit clerk, and Hillard was a reporter for the St. Louis \"Star-Times\". Fleishman served as the firm’s chairman until his retirement in 1975 at the age of 70. In 1996, he and co-founder Hillard received a Lifetime Achievement Award from \"Inside PR\" (now known as \"The Holmes Report\").\n\nIn addition to his prominence in the public relations arena, Fleishman gained distinction in the field of General Semantics. He wrote three books on that subject – “Sense and Nonsense: A Study in Human Communication,” “Troubled Talk,” and “Dialogue With Street Fighters.” Each was recognized as Book of the Year by the International Society of General Semantics. He also was the author of numerous articles on public relations and human communication, and lectured extensively throughout the country.\n\nFleishman received numerous awards and recognition over the years.

The directorate also works as the principle voice of the Pakistan's military, with its director-general serving as the official spokesperson of the armed forces. In addition, the ISPR provides funds, productions, and assists with the military-produced public relations media– both military dramas and the war films.\n\nThe Directorate of the Inter–Services Public Relations (ISPR) was established in 1949 with army colonel Shahbaz Khan becoming its first director-general. The ISPR operates as a unified public relations system for the Pakistan's military, which combined army, air force, navy, and marines. The ISPR manage the public relations requirement of the armed forces, and is staff with the combined personnel of the military along with civilian officers. It functions at the Joint Staff Headquarters (JS HQ) and plays an important role for gathering a national support for the armed forces at the public level.

It formulates much of the media policy of Pakistan's military, safeguards the armed forces from negative influences and monitors both international and domestic media.\n\nIt is likely that the army is planning the further expansion of ISPR to counter negative propaganda against the state and armed forces by international powers and their funded domestic media campaigns, in ongoing operation against terror outfits and economic terrorism.\nThat's why, for the first time in its history ISPR was being led by a three-star general,\nLt-General Asim Saleem Bajwa.\n\nOn regular basis, the ISPR release televised press releases on regarding the ongoing military exercises, and notified the civilian media about the ingenious strategic arsenal testings.\n\nApart from functioning as the public relations body of the armed forces, the ISPR handles exclusive dissemination of information regarding Pakistan's ongoing military contingency operations.\n\nIn recent years, there have been accusations of ISPR going beyond its domain and meddling in media affairs to undermine democracy. Concerns have been raised on ISPR handling media channels (Bol TV, Pak TV et al.), radio stations (FM 89.04, FM 96.00 ) and several media personalities such as Dr Shahid Masood, Arshad Sharif, Sami Ibrahim, Dr Aamir Liaqat etc. to indoctrinate pro-military narrative.\n\nISPR has regularly been criticized for posting inflammatory tweets on their official Twitter account. In April 2017, Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor (a BPS-21 officer) posted a tweet 'rejecting' Prime Minister's directives to probe Dawn Leaks controversy. After huge public outcry over the choice of words, ISPR had to redact its earlier tweet.\n\nSimilarly, during Allama Khadim Rizvi's Islamabad sit-in a tweet was posted attributing COAS's appeal to 'both sides' to exercise restraint. This was widely decried for equating people's elected government against a mob, further strengthening the belief that Army was behind the sit-ins to arm-twist government.\n\nSince the 1990s, the ISPR has been directing, producing, assisting in writings, and funding the miniseries, drama, and films on military fiction. Some of its highly acclaimed works include: Alpha Bravo Charlie— a television series on Pakistan Army directed by Shoaib Mansoor in 1990\n\n\n\n", "id": "7718433", "categories": ["Pakistan federal departments and agencies", "Military of Pakistan", "Government agencies established in 1947", "Pakistan Air Force", "Pakistan Navy", "Pakistan Army", "Air force media", "Media of the military", "Academic works about the military", "1947 establishments in Pakistan"], "title": "Inter-Services Public Relations"}

According to Memnon of Heraclea, Nicaea was destroyed by the Phocians, and its inhabitants founded Bithynian Nicaea. But even if this is true, the town must have been rebuilt soon afterwards, since we find it in the hands of the Aetolians during the Roman wars in Greece.

Gospel magic does not claim to invoke spirits or paranormal powers. Gospel magic is intended to present the Christian good news through \"visual parables\"; the trick or illusion is used to present theological points in an entertaining way with the intention that people will remember the message. Gospel magic is generally presented as stage magic or platform magic, but it can be adapted to close-up magic or micromagic situations.\n\nThe first modern use of Gospel magic is in the ministry of the Italian Catholic priest Giovanni Melchiorre Bosco (Don Bosco, 1815-1888). His autobiography lists many dozens of magic tricks used for the purpose of offering religious instruction to children and youth.\nDon Bosco has been seen as the Patron Saint of Catholic Magicians and, specifically, Catholic Gospel Magicians.\n\nIn 1910, C. H. Woolston published \"Seeing Truth: Object Lessons with Magical and Mechanical Effects\" which aimed to help adults working with children in church. Other texts were soon written that incorporated Gospel messages with magic.\n\nIn 1953, the International Fellowship of Christian Magicians began in the USA. This rapidly spread the use of the creative arts to teach the Gospel. Many Gospel Performers, dealers and authors made their first attempts at magic under their tuition. There are now chapters in many US and Canadian cities as well as in the UK, Germany and Hong Kong. An International magazine is published \"The Voice of the FCM \"every two months. Annual Conventions are held in USA, UK and Germany.\n\nThe word \"magic\" never appears in the Bible. Daniel is called the \"chief of the magicians\" or \"master of the magicians.\" Daniel 4:9 The Bible condemns sorcery, astrology, speaking to spirits and witchcraft, but never does it condemn \"magic.\"\n\nThe arts have long been used to present Christian teachings. Icons, parables, music, song, dance, poetry, sculpture, painting, stained glass, theater, radio, film, television, the Internet, stage magic and illusion have all been used. Today this often includes story-telling, drama, puppetry, ventriloquism, balloon-modelling and juggling.\n\nWell-known and influential gospel magicians include Duane Laflin, Dennis Regling , Andre Kole, Dock Haley and Brad Brown.\n\n\nThese books are based on the Tarbell Course, a standard for stage magicians pre-World War II. It was originally intended to be expanded to cover all eight-volumes in the Tarbell Series, but Miller died before this project was completed.

Led by Colonel Getaneh Haile, it was composed of three infantry divisions and accompanying support units, and some sources state it had between 20,000 and 22,000 soldiers. Gebru Tareke, noting that the morale of the soldiers was at an all-time low, and none of the divisions \"had even half of the numbers that would normally constitute an Ethiopian division – ten to twelve thousand men\", quotes Ministry of Defense reports to state that there were 15,223 men in the three divisions.\n\nThe Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) had attacked the Nadew Command a few months previously, with limited success. On 8 December 1987, the EPLF had attacked one of the divisions of the Command, the Twenty-second, with a force that may have contained as many as five infantry brigades, one mechanized battalion and three heavy-weapon battalions. On the second day of the assault, Eritrean infiltrators destroyed the divisional control center. It required the assistance of the Nineteenth Mountain Infantry Division and the 45th Infantry Brigade to halt further advances and repel the EPLF forces. Ethiopian losses in this preliminary engagement were 842 killed, 291 wounded and 615 missing; Eritrean losses have been estimated at 125 killed and 269 wounded. However, the Ethiopian side suffered even graver losses in the aftermath: on Mengistu Haile Mariam's order twenty senior officers were transferred and the commander of the Nadew Command, General Tariku Ayne, who had been absent from Afabet for medical treatment, was executed outside of Asmara on 15 February 1988. The death of one of Ethiopia's most prominent generals surprised even the EPLF, whose Radio of the Masses broadcast that the Derg had \"cut off its right hand with its left hand\". The Twenty-second Division was moved to Keren, and replaced with the Fourteenth Infantry Division.\n\nBy mid-March 1988 the Nadew Command had planned to launch an offensive campaign against the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF); however, they were pre-empted by the EPLF.\n\nOn the morning of March 17, 1988, the EPLF deployed troops on three sides around Hedai Valley to encircle the Ethiopian garrison. The first unit attacked was the newly arrived Fourteenth Division. Upon their attack, the Ethiopian forces began to withdraw but were cut off. The battle continued while the Ethiopian garrison from Keren tried to reinforce their position, which was thwarted by the EPLF.\n\nA stumbling block for the EPLF was on the left flank, where their Eighty-fifth Division was held up by the dogged resistance of the Ethiopian Twenty-ninth Mechanized Brigade. It fought without reinforcement for most of a day until its commander gambled on a retreat to Afabet. Lacking time for careful reconnaissance before its withdraw, the brigade was halted when a tank and truck were disabled by Eritrean 100mm guns, the burning vehicles blocking the road. The Ethiopians were forced to destroy their weaponry to prevent them from falling into EPLF hands. Ethiopian aircraft even bombed their own troops. The commander of the Second Revolutionary Army came to the battlefield himself to supervise opening the road to Afabet \"until he allegedly 'escaped on a camel wearing a woman's clothes through the south eastern part of Afabet' just before the fall of the garrison.\" Once the Ethiopian troops were routed in Hedai Valley, the EPLF stormed and captured Afabet. As the town was a major garrison the EPLF also captured a large cache of weapons in addition to those captured in the valley.\n\nKillion estimates that by the end of the three-day battle, the Eritreans had killed or captured over 18,000 Ethiopian soldiers. One Ethiopian to survive the battle was the commander of the Nadew Command, Colonel Getaneh Haile, who had fought his way to Keren with a single tank and four armored cars. The colonel thanked God for his escape; Gebru Tareke laconically comments that \"the deities were not as kind to most of his men, who remained trapped in the town\".\n\nNot long after this defeat, Berhane Woldemichael wrote in the periodical \"Review of African Political Economy\",\n\nThe victory over the Nadew Command is considered by the historian Basil Davidson to be the most significant victory for any liberation movement since the Vietnamese victory at Dien Bien Phu. It has also been described as the largest battle in Africa since El Alamein. However, the Ethiopian historian Gebru Tareke disagrees with this comparison to Dien Bien Phu, pointing out that Davidson made his observation from the field as a guest of the EPLF, and that \"the Ethiopian armed forces continued to fight, at times quite vigorously, for another three years.\" He concludes, \"From a global perspective, Afabet was an \"event\" whereas Dien Bien Phu was \"eventful\".\"\n", "id": "7718567", "categories": ["1988 in Eritrea", "1988 in Ethiopia", "Conflicts in 1988", "Battles involving Ethiopia", "Battles involving Cuba", "Battles of the Ethiopian Civil War", "Eritrean War of Independence"], "title": "Battle of Afabet"}

Later, during World War I, he served as Chief of Staff of the Air Service of the Second Army in France, under Col. Frank P. Lahm. On October 26, 1918 while serving as an observer in a 135th Aero Squadron airplane, the DH-4 was shot down by anti-aircraft fire; he and his pilot escaped capture. On November 3, 1918 while still serving as an observer, his plane-along with an aircraft of the 168th Aero Squadron-destroyed a German observation balloon.\n\nIn late 1941, there was significant interest by civilian pilots to assist the U.S. military. However, in Washington, D.C., those in authority scoffed at the idea that a group of non-military aviators could provide any such assistance. Despite these misgivings, the Civil Air Patrol was formed as a part of the United States' home defense needs. Curry, an Army Air Corps officer, was selected as its first national commander. As such, he was the nation's only acting general in command of a civilian army. He served in this capacity from December 1941 to March 1942.\n\nFounded as a volunteer organization, the Civil Air Patrol conducted patrols over coastal waters in search of enemy submarines and naval activity. As it was not a government-sponsored plan to provide free flight training, each individual had to pay for their own flying time.\n\nPart of the reason for the founding of the Civil Air Patrol was to keep aviation from being put aside entirely during the war. As Gen. Curry stated, \"Without such a plan [as Civil Air Patrol], there might be no private aviation for the duration of the war; with such a plan, there is a chance that private flying may continue and develop.\" Under Curry's guidance, wings were formed in every state. He helped mobilize 100,000 private pilots for non-combatant service; thus freeing military pilots for wartime duty.\n\nThere was no discrimination because of one's gender. Individual ability, experience and past records were the main criteria for selection. In Curry's words, \"There must be no doubt in the minds of out gallant women fliers that they are needed and, in my opinion, indispensable to the full success of the Civil Air Patrol organization. A great part of the progress made in organizing civilian aviation under Civil Air Patrol has been due to the volunteer help given by women flyers.\" Although he only served a few months as national commander, Gen. Curry's organizational skills were influential in determining the future growth of the Civil Air Patrol.\n\nOriginally, the Civil Air Patrol was given the opportunity to prove itself for a 90-day test period. Success in deterring German U-boat attacks on merchant vessels encouraged the USAAF and USN to support the Civil Air Patrol's coastal patrol mission, among others. After the end of World War II, the Civil Air Patrol continued to serve the nation in performance of dangerous missions. The Colorado Wing, Civil Air Patrol, and Colorado State Director of Aeronautics, headed now by retired Maj. Gen. John F. Curry, conducted light plane surveys through the rugged Colorado Rocky Mountains. Where more than 50 peaks have an elevation of greater than , scores of flying individuals lost their lives due to unpredictable winds. As a result of Curry's direction, maps of safe flying routes were developed by Colorado Civil Air Patrol personnel.\n\nThe first Civil Air Patrol cadet achievement, the General J. F. Curry Achievement, is named in his honor.\n\n", "id": "7718589", "categories": ["1973 deaths", "American military personnel of World War I", "Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (United States)", "United States Army generals", "Recipients of the Legion of Merit", "Members of the Early Birds of Aviation", "United States Army Air Forces generals", "1886 births", "Recipients of the Order of the Black Star", "American military personnel of World War II", "Air Corps Tactical School alumni", "Chevaliers of the Légion d'honneur", "National Commanders of the Civil Air Patrol"], "title": "John F.

Windows Live Confucius, similar to Windows Live Barcode, allowed users to create QR Codes online from a web browser. In addition, Windows Live Confucius also allowed users to create QR Codes using an offline Windows application from their desktop, named \"Desktop QR Code generator\". Together with the launch of Desktop QR Code generator, the \"QR Reader client\" was released as well for users to view QR codes on their Windows Mobile devices.\n\nThe \"Desktop QR Code generator\" can generate QR Code for any text, vCard, calendar and URL information.
