When he was 16 he moved to RC Lens but never managed to play for the professional team there as he was confined to the third and fourth teams.\n\nBossu joined Barnet in March 2000. He made his debut and subsequently only first team appearance for Barnet on 17 May 2000 in the second leg of the play-off semi-final. Barnet were trailing 2–0 (4–1 on aggregate) away to Peterborough United when Bossu replaced the injured Lee Harrison in the Barnet goal. He conceded one more goal, giving David Farrell his hat-trick and confirming Peterborough's place in the final.\n\nHe joined Conference side Hayes on loan in December 2000. His one-man heroics in the 1–0 win away to Boston United on 2 December ended a run of seven consecutive defeats. However, in the process Bossu broke a finger and returned to Barnet to recuperate.\n\nHe joined Rushden & Diamonds on loan in March 2001, but failed to make a first team appearance for them and was released by Barnet at the end of the season. He rejoined Hayes in August 2001, but lost his place as Hayes were relegated from the Conference. Although he began the following season as second-choice, he regained his place in the side and went on to win the Hayes Supporters' Player of the Year Award in 2003. In the midst of this he had also become the first Hayes goalkeeper to score a goal, with a last-minute header in the game away to St Albans City.\n\nBossu joined Gillingham in September 2003 and made his debut later that month away to Walsall. He played just five more times that season, including the victory at home to Premier League side Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup.\n\nIn August 2004 he joined Torquay United on a three-month loan deal playing in the first two games of the season away to Bristol City and at home to Hull City the same month. However, he was sent back to Gillingham by Torquay with a knee injury, prompting a row over who should pay his wages. He joined Oldham Athletic in late October 2004, but failed to make their first team.\n\nHe was released by Gillingham at the end of the 2004–05 season, joining Darlington in August 2005. The same month he joined Accrington Stanley on loan, playing one Conference National game away to Cambridge United before returning to Darlington where he played 10 times before being released at the end of the season. He then joined Walsall in September 2006, but was released in May 2008.\n\nAfter being released by Walsall, Bossu then went on trial with Scottish Premier League side Aberdeen. After impressing goalkeeping coach Jim Leighton, he was offered a contract with the Scottish club. Bossu left Aberdeen in August 2009 after only three appearances for the club.\n\nHe signed for Crewe Alexandra on a two-month contract on 28 October following a successful trial.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7738274", "text": "David Foster (novelist)\n\nDavid Manning Foster (born 15 May 1944) is an Australian novelist and scientist. He has written a range of satires on the theme of the decline of Western civilization, as well as producing short stories, poetry, essays, and a number of radio plays.\n\nDavid Manning Foster was born on 15 May 1944 in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia to George and Hazel (née Manning) Foster, vaudeville and radio performers who separated before his birth, and spent his early years in Katoomba, raised by his mother and maternal grandparents. In 1950, Foster spent six months in Katoomba Hospital recovering from poliomyelitis, a disease that left him with a slight limp. His mother married a bank officer and Foster attended high schools in Sydney (Fort Street High School), Armidale (Armidale High School), and Orange (Orange High School) as the family moved from city to country towns. At Orange High, Foster began playing drums professionally in a jazz dance band.\n\nIn 1961, Foster commenced a Arts degree at the University of Sydney in Sydney, but he left studies after a year to work and travel. A year thereafter, in 1963, he return to the University to study chemistry at the University of Sydney School of Chemistry.\n\nFoster worked part-time as a musician and as an engineer at Marrickville Council while he completed his Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. He was awarded the University Medal for Inorganic Chemistry in 1967 and moved to Canberra for a Ph.D. in Biological Inorganic Chemistry at the Australian National University, from which he graduated in 1970.\n\nAt the end of this degree, he went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the United States to pursue postdoctoral studies at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nDuring this time, he began to write his first novellas, later published in \"North South West\" (1973). Back in Sydney in 1972, he worked as a Research Officer in the Department of Medicine, University of Sydney, before abandoning science for a career as a novelist. Since then he has supported himself and his family by various work as a pool attendant, musician, postman, truck driver, martial arts instructor and trawler fisherman After the publication of \"North South West\" by Macmillan, Foster was awarded an Australia Council for the Arts Fellowship.\n\nFoster's first collection of novellas was well-received, and his first novel, \"The Pure Land\" (1974) won the inaugural The Age Book of the Year prize. The novel is strongly autobiographical as it traces the experiences of the young scientist Danny Harris in America and Australia. At the end of the novel, Danny has abandoned science and appears to be inventing the novel in which he is a character. His grandfather, Albert Manwaring, has left his life as a photographer in Katoomba to seek success and, finally, spiritual purity in America; Danny, born in America, reverses the journey to find a Pure Land in Australia. The novel satirises both the grasping materialism of America and the backward colonialism of Australia. This novel was followed by another collection of stories \"Escape to Reality\" (1977) which pursued Foster's interest in masculine irresponsibility and the paradoxes of science and art. With a fellow scientist at the Australian National University, called ‘D.K. Lyall’ (Des Kirk), Foster published \"The Empathy Experiment\" (1977), a strange exploration of paranoia in the context of scientific experiments in empathy.\n\nA 1978 Marten Bequest enabled Foster to travel to Scotland to research \"Moonlite\" (1981), his acclaimed satire on colonialism, which places the experiences of Scottish islanders during the clearances of the nineteenth century in paradoxical comparison with the colonising of Australia at the same time. \"Plumbum\" (1983) uses Foster's experience in jazz bands to satirise the contemporary Western adulation of rock musicians, contrasting this fervour with the various religions of Bangkok and India. \"The Adventures of Christian Rosy Cross\" (1985) is a burlesque historical satire on the paradoxes of religious belief following the picaresque adventures of Christian as he searches for the philosopher's stone. \"Dog Rock: a Postal Pastoral\" (1985) offers a more benign comedy as Foster examines the trivia of an Australian country town like Bundanoon. A second Dog Rock novel, \"The Pale Blue Crochet Coathanger Cover\" (1988) continues this nostalgic view of a disappearing rural life with particular reference to the misuse of animals, and, in 2012, Foster published a third Dog Rock novel, \"Man of Letters\". \"Testostero\" (1987), inspired by a residence in Venice in 1984, uses the convention of the separated twins to satirise the cultural differences between Britain and Australia, with a third possibility represented by Italy. Among its many allusions and parodies, the novel invokes the traditions of Carnivale and Carlo Goldoni's play,\"The Venetian Twins\".\n\nAfter the Australian Bicentennial celebrations of 1988 Foster published his own satire of the state of contemporary Australia in \"Mates of Mars\" (1991). The novel follows a group of martial arts enthusiasts as they travel from Sydney to the Northern Territory and encounter a spiritualism that challenges their various beliefs and attitudes. The characters represent a multicultural Australia, and demonstrate the novel's premise that ‘Australians are not just members of the internal proletariat of...Western Christian Civilisation ( a civilisation now decrepit, that can never take Colonials seriously) but also, in certain key aspects chiefly, but not exclusively, economic, barbarian members of the external proletariat of the Sinic Mahayana Buddhist Civilisation, in its Westernised Japanese/Korean/Colonial Chinese branch, on the southernmost march of that civilisation'.\n\nFoster used the support of an Australian government Creative Fellowship awarded in 1991 (a ‘Keating’ award) to research his monumental \"The Glade Within the Grove\" (1996). Narrated by the postman of Dog Rock, D’Arcy D’Oliveres, this novel examines the destruction of the native forests of Australia and the decline of Christianity in the context of pre-Christian religious beliefs. Set mainly in the ‘revolutionary’ year of 1968, the novel speculates about a group of hippies who set up a commune in the South Eastern forests of Australia. The novel's accompanying poem,\"The Ballad of Erinungerah\", claims to be the work of a child of the commune and describes the visit of the goddess, Brigid, and her demand that the men castrate themselves. The novel celebrates the forests in lyrical descriptions, satirises the stupidity of the communards and translates snatches of classic texts into Australian vernacular. It is celebratory, satirical and elegiac. Later, Foster published under his own name an essay ‘On Castration’ in \"Heat\" magazine, that incorporated part of the novel as it argued that male sexuality is a destructive force that needs to be controlled. This obsession is evident in all Foster's work after \"Mates of Mars\". His novel \"In the New Country\" offers a comic and despairing view of the decline of rural life in Australia, comparing it to the corresponding decline of spirituality in the Old Country of Ireland. \"The Land Where Stories End\" is a fairytale about a woodcutter in Ireland who goes on an impossible quest for spiritual purity. \n\nIn 2009, Foster published \"Sons of the Rumour\", his most ambitious and original novel to date. Modelled on the structure of the One Thousand and One Nights, it changes the storyteller's role from Shahrazad to a group of men travelling through the 7th century city of Merv. Richard Burton's Arabian Nights are transformed into Iranian days. Foster creates a comic structure for the stories with his rather Australian bickering couple the Shah and Shahrazad, but the stories are imaginative adventures, sometimes puzzling, sometimes grotesque and often wondrous. For example, ‘The Mine in the Moon’ imagines a world without women, where boys grow up without maternal comfort; ‘The Tears of the Fish’ describes an orgy and castration ritual; 'The Gilt Felt Yurt' measures the loss of freedom in the creation of civilization and settlement. In the course of the stories the Shah undergoes an education in spiritualism and sexual understanding. A final section of the novel moves to the present day where a modern man undergoes a visionary experience in Ireland. Reviewing the novel for \"Australian Book Review\", James Ley concluded, 'There is simply no one remotely like him in contemporary Australian fiction. He is so far ahead of everyone else that it's not funny. Except that it is funny—very, very funny'.\n\nIn 1964, Foster married his Orange High girlfriend, Robin Bowers, with whom he would have three children; Samantha (b. 1968), Natalie (b. 1969), and Seth (b. 1973).\n\nIn 1974, he left his wife and family to live with Gerda Busch, the singer in the Canberra jazz band where he played drums. They moved to the country town of Bundanoon, where they married and had three children, Antigone (b. 1975), Levi (b. 1976), and Zoe Foster Blake (b. 1980). Foster worked as a postman at Bundanoon for many years, and his \"Dog Rock\" novels provide a comic version of the town.\n\nHis daughter Zoe is also a writer and is married to comedian Hamish Blake.\n\n\nNovels\n\nPoetry\nNon-fiction\n\n\n", "id": "7738274", "categories": ["Writers from New South Wales", "Australian chemists", "People educated at Orange High School (New South Wales)", "Australian poets", "Australian male poets", "University of Sydney alumni", "Australian male novelists", "Patrick White Award winners", "People from Katoomba, New South Wales", "Living people", "20th-century Australian male writers", "20th-century Australian novelists", "1944 births", "Australian medical researchers", "Miles Franklin Award winners", "University of Pennsylvania people", "21st-century Australian novelists", "People educated at Fort Street High School", "Australian National University alumni"], "title": "David Foster (novelist)"}

She was the wife of composer John Towner Williams, who composed the music for \"Star Wars\", amongst others, from 1956 until her death. Following her marriage to Williams, Ruick appeared in few motion pictures. They had three children together.\n\nBarbara Ruick Williams died on March 3, 1974, aged 43, from a cerebral hemorrhage in Reno, Nevada while on location with her last film, Robert Altman's \"California Split\", which is dedicated to her.

In 1946, at the age of 43, he was the second-oldest player to appear in an American League game that season.\n\nRyba was usually used in relief during his ten-year major league career. He was also used as a catcher in ten games and was so versatile. While in the minor leagues, he played all nine positions at various points. He made his major league debut on September 22, 1935 against the Cincinnati Reds in game 1 of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park. He pitched seven innings of two-hit relief and was the winning pitcher in the 14–4 game. He also had two hits and three runs batted in to help his cause.\n\nIn four seasons with St. Louis he won 16 games, lost 9, and had an ERA of 4.39. On September 5, 1940 he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitcher Al Brazle. Ryba was 37 years old and had not pitched in the big leagues for two years, but his best seasons were ahead of him.\n\nIn six years with the Red Sox he won 36 games, lost 25, saved 16, and had an ERA of 3.42. Boston won the pennant in his last season, and Ryba appeared in Game # 4 of the 1946 World Series, giving up one earned run and allowing two inherited runners to score in 2/3 of an inning. Ryba caught both games of a home doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians on July 19, 1942.\n\nRyba finished in his league's top ten for games finished 5 times, games pitched 3 times, saves 2 times, and winning percentage 1 time.\n\nCareer totals for 250 games (240 as a pitcher) include a record of 52–34 (.605), 36 games started, 16 complete games, 2 shutouts, 132 games finished, and 16 saves. He allowed 319 earned runs in 783.2 innings pitched for an ERA of 3.66. He wielded a strong bat for a pitcher, hitting .235 (58-for-247) with 24 RBI. He was strong defensively as well, making just seven errors as a pitcher and none as a catcher.\n\nRyba managed in the Red Sox, Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds farm systems after his pitching career, coached for St. Louis from 1951 to 1955, and scouted for the Cardinals and Reds until his death, at the age of 68 in Brookline Station, Missouri, when he fell from a ladder in his yard while trimming branches of a tree.\n\n\n", "id": "7738332", "categories": ["1971 deaths", "Accidental deaths from falls", "Fort Wayne Chiefs players", "St. Louis Cardinals scouts", "Houston Buffaloes players", "Scottdale Scotties players", "1903 births", "International League MVP award winners", "Waynesboro Red Birds players", "St. Louis Cardinals players", "Saint Francis Red Flash baseball players", "Columbus Red Birds players", "Springfield Red Wings players", "Rochester Red Wings managers", "Springfield Cardinals players", "St. Louis Cardinals coaches", "Lynn Red Sox players", "Houston Buffaloes managers", "Louisville Colonels (minor league) managers", "People from Jefferson County, Pennsylvania", "Cincinnati Reds scouts", "American Association (20th century) MVP Award winners", "Rochester Red Wings players", "Accidental deaths in Missouri", "Dayton Aviators players", "Boston Red Sox players", "Baseball players from Pennsylvania", "Major League Baseball pitchers", "Major League Baseball catchers"], "title": "Mike Ryba"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7738360", "text": "Conditional event algebra\n\nA conditional event algebra (CEA) is an algebraic structure whose domain consists of logical objects described by statements of forms such as \"If \"A\", then \"B\"\", \"\"B\", given \"A\"\", and \"\"B\", in case \"A\"\". Unlike the standard Boolean algebra of events, a CEA allows the defining of a probability function, \"P\", which satisfies the equation \"P\"(If \"A\" then \"B\") = \"P\"(\"A\" and \"B\") / \"P\"(\"A\") over a usefully broad range of conditions.\n\nIn standard probability theory, one begins with a set, Ω, of outcomes (or, in alternate terminology, a set of possible worlds) and a set, \"F\", of some (not necessarily all) subsets of Ω, such that \"F\" is closed under the countably infinite versions of the operations of basic set theory: union (∪), intersection (∩), and complementation ( ′). A member of \"F\" is called an event (or, alternatively, a proposition), and \"F\", the set of events, is the domain of the algebra. Ω is, necessarily, a member of \"F\", namely the trivial event \"Some outcome occurs.\"\n\nA probability function \"P\" assigns to each member of \"F\" a real number, in such a way as to satisfy the following axioms:\n\nIt follows that \"P\"(\"E\") is always less than or equal to 1. The probability function is the basis for statements like \"P\"(\"A\" ∩ \"B\"′) = 0.73, which means, \"The probability that \"A\" but not \"B\" is 73%.\"\n\nThe statement \"The probability that if \"A\", then \"B\", is 24%.\" means (put intuitively) that event \"B\" occurs in 24% of the outcomes where event \"A\" occurs. The standard formal expression of this is \"P\"(\"B\"|\"A\") = 0.24, where the conditional probability \"P\"(\"B\"|\"A\") equals, by definition, \"P\"(\"A\" ∩ \"B\") / \"P\"(\"A\").\n\nIt is tempting to write, instead, \"P\"(\"A\" → \"B\") = 0.24, where \"A\" → \"B\" is the conditional event \"If \"A\", then \"B\"\". That is, given events \"A\" and \"B\", one might posit an event, \"A\" → \"B\", such that \"P\"(\"A\" → \"B\") could be counted on to equal \"P\"(\"B\"|\"A\"). One benefit of being able to refer to conditional events would be the opportunity to nest conditional event descriptions within larger constructions. Then, for instance, one could write \"P\"(\"A\" ∪ (\"B\" → \"C\")) = 0.51, meaning, \"The probability that either \"A\", or else if \"B\", then \"C\", is 51%\".\n\nUnfortunately, philosopher David Lewis showed that in orthodox probability theory, only certain trivial Boolean algebras with very few elements contain, for any given \"A\" and \"B\", an event \"X\" such that \"P\"(\"X\") = \"P\"(\"B\"|\"A\") is true for any probability function \"P\". Later extended by others, this result stands as a major obstacle to any talk about logical objects that can be the bearers of conditional probabilities.\n\nThe classification of an algebra makes no reference to the nature of the objects in the domain, being entirely a matter of the formal behavior of the operations on the domain. However, investigation of the properties of an algebra often proceeds by assuming the objects to have a particular character. Thus, the canonical Boolean algebra is, as described above, an algebra of subsets of a universe set. What Lewis in effect showed is what can and cannot be done with an algebra whose members behave like members of such a set of subsets.\n\nConditional event algebras circumvent the obstacle identified by Lewis by using a nonstandard domain of objects. Instead of being members of a set \"F\" of subsets of some universe set Ω, the canonical objects are normally higher-level constructions of members of \"F.\" The most natural construction, and historically the first, uses ordered pairs of members of \"F.\" Other constructions use sets of members of \"F\" or infinite sequences of members of \"F\".\n\nSpecific types of CEA include the following (listed in order of discovery):\n\nCEAs differ in their formal properties, so that they cannot be considered a single, axiomatically characterized class of algebra. Goodman-Nguyen-van Frassen algebras, for example, are Boolean while Calabrese algebras are non-distributive. The latter, however, support the intuitively appealing identity \"A\" → (\"B\" → \"C\") = (\"A\" ∩ \"B\") → \"C\", while the former do not.\n\nGoodman, I. R., R. P. S. Mahler, and H. T.

The second son of Takeda Sōkichi, a samurai of the Takeda clan who worked his farm and taught at a local school in a Buddhist temple. His mother, Tomi Kurokochi, was a daughter of Dengoro Kurokochi, a Yari and Kenjutsu master. It is believed that Sōkaku received his first martial arts training from his father who had a dojo on their property.\nSōkichi was apparently expert in the use of both sword and spear, and had once been a sumo wrestler of ozeki rank. It is believed that Sōkaku was exposed to the teachings of Hōzōin-ryū Takada-ha and Ono-ha Ittō-ryū, schools of spear and swordsmanship respectively.\n\nSōkaku then left to go on a period of austere training where he travelled, fought and trained at the schools of many teachers, a not uncommon practise of the time. Reputedly, Sōkaku spent some time as a live-in student of Kenkichi Sakakibara, headmaster of the Jikishinkage-ryū and considered to be one of the most famous and skilled swordsmen of the era.\n\nWith the outlawing of the samurai class and the prohibition against carrying swords (Haitōrei Edict) apparentally Sokaku decided to emphasize the empty handed, jujutsu oriented, techniques of his ancestor's art. These apparently were 'oshiki-uchi', or secret teachings of the Aizu clan, up to that point. These, along with other skills he had acquired, were combined to create an art which he christened first 'Daitō-ryū jūjutsu' and later 'Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu'.\n\nIn about 1875, rumor reached Sōkaku that Saigō Takamori had launched his rebellion in Satsuma against the forces of the new Meiji government. He decided immediately that he would go to lend his support. He made it as far as Kyushu but was unable to reach his destination, so he returned to Osaka where he spent the next ten years as a guest in the Kyōshin Meichi-ryū dojo of swordsman Momonoi Shunzo.\n\nSōkaku lived a somewhat itinerant life, travelling the length and breadth of the country giving seminars in martial arts to military officers, police officers and martial arts enthusiasts, often of high social standing. He left extensive records of those he taught in his \"eimeiroku\" and \"shareikoku\" - attendance and fee ledgers.\n\nTaking over the role of headmaster of the art was Sōkaku's son, Tokimune Takeda, who established the Daitokan school in Hokkaidō to promote the art and re-christened it 'Daitō-ryū Aiki Budō'. Tokimune is said to have contributed much of the teaching system which exists for the art today; naming and classifying the techniques and further simplifying the weapons component of the system. He emphasized the Ona ha Itto-ryu portion of the weapons curriculum over other elements that Sōkaku taught to some advanced students.\n\nSokaku's highest ranking students were Hisa Takuma and Masao Tonedate, both high executives of the \"Asahi\" newspaper in Osaka, whose own students established the Takumakai and the Daibukan.\n\nOther important students of Sōkaku's were Yukiyoshi Sagawa, who some believe was the most talented of his early students, Kodo Horikawa (Kotaro), whose students established the Kodokai and the Roppokai, Kōtarō Yoshida, Hosaku Matsuda and Tomekichi Yamamoto.\n\nHis most famous student was the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba and it is the popularity of this modern martial arts form that is responsible for much of the interest in Daitō-ryū today.\n\nHosaku Matsuda was taught by Sōkaku, who in turn taught Yoshiji Okuyama, who in turn founded the Hakkō-ryū Jujutsu school. Okuyama taught Michiomi Nakano, who later as Dōshin Sō, founder of Nippon Shorinji Kempo. Choi Yong-Sool, the founder of Hapkido was adopted by Sokaku and trained with him as well.\n\nThe influence of the teachings of Sokaku Takeda are readily discernible in the physical techniques of aikido, Hakko Ryu, Nippon Shorinji Kempo, hapkido and judo's goshin jutsu self-defense kata (via Kenji Tomiki) today.\n\n\n", "id": "7738370", "categories": ["Sportspeople from Fukushima Prefecture", "Japanese jujutsuka", "Japanese swordsmen", "1859 births"], "title": "Takeda Sōkaku"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7738400", "text": "Humanistic coefficient\n\nA humanistic coefficient () is a conceptual object, methodological principle, or method of conducting social research wherein data analysis stresses the perceived import of analyzed experiences to their participants. The term was coined by Polish sociologist Florian Znaniecki.\n\nZnaniecki coined the term in Polish in his \"Wstęp do socjologii\" (Introduction to Sociology, 1922) and translated it into English as \"humanistic coefficient\" in his book, \"The Object-Matter of Sociology\" (1927).\n\nGrossly and simply speaking, the humanistic coefficient is the difference between trying to describe or explain social facts as if they were purely physical phenomena, or doing it instead by taking into account the culture of the folk or milieu in which those facts happen.\n\nIn Znaniecki's own words: \"\"an observer of cultural life can understand the data observed only if taken with the \"humanistic coefficient\"\", only if he does not limit his observation to his own direct experience of the data but reconstructs the experience and the data in the social context of the people involved\". Elsewhere he wrote: \"\"This essential character of cultural data we call the humanistic coefficient, because such data, as objects of the student's theoretic reflection, already belong to somebody's else's experience and are such as this active experience makes them.\"\"\n\nPiotr Sztompka defines the humanistic coefficient as \"\"a connection that exists between each social fact and actions and experiences of particular individuals, and the resulting need for those facts to be studied from specific perspective that requires the research to place him or herself in the position of those individuals.\"\" Elżbieta Hałas in turn defines it as \"\"the notion of the human collective's constructing and reconstructing of reality\"\", thus related to the concept of social constructionist.\n\nAccording to the concept of the humanistic coefficient, all social facts are created by social actors, and can only be understood from their perspective. No social facts can exist without connection to some individuals (although that connection does not have to necessarily be consciously perceived). Thus the sociologist should study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not as an independent observer (objectively); in other words the scientist needs to understand the world of the subject. Ken Plummer puts it curtly as \"the object of study is always linked to somebody's human meanings.\n\nWhile some have criticized the humanistic coefficient approach as too close to subjectivism, Znaniecki himself saw is as anti-subjectivist; he noted that social facts like cultural systems can exist even if nobody perceives their existence. He was also critical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only if they can be objectively described. Both natural and social sciences operate within the bounds of the humanistic coefficient, but the natural sciences may abstract the pheomena they analyze from it, while the social sciences are methodologically obliged to account for it. Thus Znaniecki argued that the difference between natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject of what is being studied: for Znaniecki, natural sciences studied things, and social sciences – cultural values. He saw sociology as a nomothetic science that should be able to use a similar methodology as natural sciences.\n\nThe humanistic coefficient concerns the ontology of culture, but it also has an epistemological aspect, as it describes how sociological concepts should be constructed in an environment where social facts investigated by the researchers can be accessed only through experiences and actions of the subjects he or she observes.\n\nThe humanistic coefficient is a major element in the sociological theory of Znaniecki.\n\n", "id": "7738400", "categories": [], "title": "Humanistic coefficient"}

Folk-dance was the brain-child of South African Dr. SH Pellisier, who was visiting Sweden in 1915 with a friend to become more proficient in carpentry. After finishing their day's work they met with other young people in their respective countries' national dress to practise their folk-singing and -dancing. The South Africans were the only ones left out as they did not have any traditional dances.\n\nBack in South Africa, Pellisier translated four Swedish dances and taught them to pupils at the Afrikaans High School in Boshof where he was Deputy Headmaster. During a Sunday School picnic on the farm Vuisfontein near Boshof on 22 February 1914 they performed the dances for the first time. The picnic games became known as volkspele.\n\nWith the help of the Reddingsdaadbond, an organisation which was established to assist poor Afrikaners after the Anglo Boer War, groups of dancers called \"laers\" were established throughout the country.\n\nGet-togethers called \"saamtrekke\" are usually organised where all the \"laers\" get together to sing and do folk-dancing. The folk-dancers also present displays and have courses on different levels, seniors: people out of school, and juniors: learners in school, for either a weekend or longer. During the June school holidays there are also courses for grade 5-7 pupils (known as the \"Judith Pellissierweek\" - named after the wife of Dr Pellissier), grade 8-9 pupils (known as the \"Vormingsweek\" - Formative) and for grade 10-12 pupils (known as the \"Pellisierweek\"). From time to time there are overseas tours; or a folk-dance group or two will tour with South African folk-dancers in South Africa, giving displays at various towns. At these \"saamtrekke\", displays, tours and courses the dress (\"volkspeledrag\") is as the photos below show.\n\nTours have been conducted to Europe, Namibia, The United States and Turkey, with groups from Italy, Germany, Belgium and others touring South Africa.\n\nThe dress originated from the formal dress the pioneers or Voortrekkers wore. It is called national dress, as in the European countries. All folk-dancers in South Africa must use the same style with only the colours differing. Each \"laer\" has its own colours for the ladies' dresses as well as for the men's waistcoats - these are embroidered with indigenous flower designs.\n\n", "id": "7738485", "categories": ["South African culture", "Afrikaans words and phrases"], "title": "Volkspele"}

What is now termed a right Goldie ring is a ring \"R\" that has finite uniform dimension (=\"finite rank\") as a right module over itself, and satisfies the ascending chain condition on right annihilators of subsets of \"R\". \n\nGoldie's theorem states that the semiprime right Goldie rings are precisely those that have a semisimple Artinian right classical ring of quotients. The structure of this ring of quotients is then completely determined by the Artin–Wedderburn theorem.\n\nIn particular, Goldie's theorem applies to semiprime right Noetherian rings, since by definition right Noetherian rings have the ascending chain condition on \"all\" right ideals. This is sufficient to guarantee that a right-Noetherian ring is right Goldie. The converse does not hold: every right Ore domain is a right Goldie domain, and hence so is every commutative integral domain.\n\nA consequence of Goldie's theorem, again due to Goldie, is that every semiprime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of prime principal right ideal rings. Every prime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a matrix ring over a right Ore domain.\n\nThis is a sketch of the characterization mentioned in the introduction.

The islands are limestone karst towers and are a part of Ao Phang Nga National Park.\n\nAbout from the shores of Khao Phing Kan lies a tall islet called Ko Ta Pu (, ) or Ko Tapu (, ). Since 1974, when they were featured in the James Bond movie \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", Khao Phing Kan and Ko Ta Pu have been popularly called James Bond Island.\n\nKhao Phing Kan means \"hills leaning against each other\" in Thai, reflecting the connected nature of the islands. Ko Ta Pu can be literally translated as \"crab's eye\" island, and Ko Tapu can be translated as \"nail\" or \"spike\" island, reflecting its shape. With \"ko\" () meaning \"island\" and \"khao\" () meaning \"hill\", the terms ko, khao, and Ko Khao are frequently interchanged in the naming of the islands. After appearing in the 1974 James Bond movie \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", Khao Phing Kan and sometimes Ko Ta Pu became widely referred to as James Bond Island, especially in tourist guides, and their original names are rarely used by locals.\n\nBefore 1974, the island was a rarely visited indigenous area. However, it was chosen as one of the locations for the 1974 James Bond film \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" as the hideout for Bond's antagonist, Francisco Scaramanga. After the movie release it turned into a popular tourist destination. Popularity and increased tourism left Khao Phing Kan with substantial litter.\n\nIn 1981, the island became the most famous part of the newly established Ao Phang Nga Marine National Park. Since 1998, it is forbidden for tourist boats to approach Ko Ta Pu. This measure aims to stop erosion of the limestone rocks on and near the islet that might eventually result in the island's collapse.\n\nKhao Phing Kan consists of two forest-covered islands with steep shores. They lie in the northwestern part of Phang Nga Bay, from the mainland, amid a group of a dozen of other islands. Its western part is about in diameter whereas the eastern part is about long and wide and is elongated northwards. The island has a few caves and two sandy beaches, in the southwest and between the twin islands. The former hosts the government office where every visitor has to pay a tax. The latter is used as the port for the tourist boats arriving from the mainland and has several souvenir shops selling items like coral and shells and plastic-encased butterflies, scorpions, and spiders. Beaches and caves are regularly flooded with the tides, which have an amplitude of , so access to some caves is only possible during low tide. The Thai name for Khao Phing Kan reflects the particular shape of the island which appears as if a flat limestone cliff tumbled sideways and leaned on a similar rock in the centre of the island.\n\nWaters around the island are only few metres deep and are pale-green in colour. The bottom is covered with silt, brought to the Phang Nga Bay by several rivers from the north.\n\nKo Ta Pu is a limestone rock about tall with the diameter increasing from about near the water level to about at the top. It lies about to the west from the northern part of Khao Phing Kan.\n\nA local legend explains the formation of Ko Ta Pu as follows. Once upon a time, there lived a fisherman who used to bring home many fish every time he went to the sea. However, one day he could not catch any fish despite many attempts and only picked up a nail with his net. He kept throwing the nail back into the sea and catching it again. Furious, he took his sword and cut the nail in half with all his strength. Upon impact, one half of the nail jumped up and speared into the sea, forming Ko Ta Pu.\n\nA scientific version of the Ko Ta Pu formation says that in the Permian period, the area was a barrier reef. Then, upon tectonic movements, it ruptured, and its parts were dispersed over the area and flooded by the rising ocean. Wind, waves, water currents, and tides gradually eroded the islands thus formed, sometimes producing peculiar shapes, such as Ko Ta Pu. Tide-related erosion is visible at the bottom\nof the rock.\n\nIn the \"James Bond\" film \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", Francisco Scaramanga describes Ko Ta Pu as a \"mushroom-shaped rock\", which houses two large solar panels that come up on top of Ko Ta Pu and lock on to the Sun.\n\nKo Ta Pu is also featured in another \"James Bond\" film (\"Tomorrow Never Dies\", identified as in Vietnam) and in the Italian film \"Quo Vado?\" (identified as in the Philippines).\nThe area has a tropical marine climate, which is characterized by frequent rains and stable temperature. According to the data collected between 1961 and 1990, average number of rainy days is 189 per year bringing of precipitation, mostly between May and October. The temperature varies between and and the average relative humidity is 83%.\n\nMost of the island is covered with deciduous limestone shrubland and evergreen trees. Some plants, such as \"Pandanus\", cycads, euphorbs and prickly pear cactus grow on nearly soil-free cliffs, such as those of Ko Ta Pu, penetrating their roots into the numerous cracks and surviving on rainwater.\n\nShallow water depth, warm, stable temperature, and rich nutrient supply from mangrove forests and several rivers running into Phang Nga Bay result in abundant plankton and other marine life. The bay island hosts 26 species of reptiles, 24 species of fish, 14 species of shrimp, 15 species of crab, and 16 species of manta rays, sharks, and game fish. Most fishes are typical of coral reefs, such as butterflyfish. Other common inhabitants are blue crab, swimming crab, mudskipper, humpback shrimp, mud lobster, pomfret, sole, anchovy, scad, rock cod, rainbow cuttlefish, soft cuttlefish, musk crab, mackerel, moray eel, puffer fish, rabbitfish, groupers, black sea cucumber, brain coral, staghorn coral and flowerlike soft coral. Amphibians include \"Fejervarya raja\", cricket frog (\"Fejervarya limnocharis\") and the common tree frog. Aquatic plants are represented by red algae, \"Halimeda\", seagrass, and plant plankton. There are more than 100 species of birds in the area such as the striated heron, Pacific reef heron, little egret and others.\n\n\n", "id": "7738589", "categories": ["Islands of Thailand", "Geography of Phang Nga Province"], "title": "Khao Phing Kan"}

Farber was previously CEO of the Paloma Foundation, an NGO which works with homeless youth shelters until his appointment with the Mosaic Institute. He also writes on human and civil rights issues for the \"Huffington Post\" and \"NOW Magazine\", as well as various newspapers across Canada, and is frequently interviewed on these topics by the media.\n\nFarber was born in Ottawa, Ontario. His father was a Polish Jew who lost his first wife, two children and other family members in the Holocaust. Farber cites his father's experience as a major motivation in his life, saying, \"the pain my father endured during the war is what drove me to fight for social justice today.\"\n\nFarber received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Carleton University in Ottawa where he was involved in many social causes. He was a student leader with Ottawa's Jewish community and was also involved in the campaign to pressure the Soviet Union to allow Soviet Jews to emigrate. As the director of Ottawa's Jewish Community Centre, Farber also directed its day camp in the mid 1970s.\n\nHe graduated in 1975 and found a job with the Children's Aid Society (CAS) and the Youth Services Bureau of Ottawa-Carleton.\nWhile working for the Children's Aid Society in the early 1980s, Farber served as president of Ontario Public Service Employees Union Local 454, representing over 300 social and child-care workers.\n\nFarber was employed by the Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) from 1984 until 2011. He was appointed chief executive officer in 2005 and had previously been executive director of the CJC's Ontario section and CJC's National Community Relations Director. The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs absorbed the CJC on July 1, 2011.\n\nFarber was appointed by the Ontario government to serve as a member of the Hate Crimes Community Working Group. He also serves on the city of Vaughan, Ontario's Mayor's Task Force on Community Safety & Security.

One member had allegedly planned an attack on the CJC offices to \"take some people out\", with Farber believed to be the primary target.\n\nOver the preceding years, Heritage Front had been infiltrated by, and become largely directed by, Grant Bristow, an undercover agent of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). In August 1994, a report by the \"Toronto Sun\" exposed CSIS domestic spying including Bristow's undercover role in Heritage Front, effectively putting an end to any plot.\n\nFarber, who is not gay, was mocked by columnist Antonia Zerbisias in 2009 for wearing a \"Nobody knows I'm gay\" T-shirt (sold as a fundraiser by a Jewish LGBTQ group) while marching in Toronto's Pride parade as a protest against the inclusion of Queers Against Israeli Apartheid in the march. The Canadian Jewish Congress filed a complaint with the \"Toronto Star\" against Zerbisias \"outing\" Farber. The newspaper's public editor ruled that Zerbisias' comments \"fell short of the Star's standards of fairness, accuracy and civility,\" but subsequently modified her assessment and criticized Farber and the CJC since, in their complaint, they did not \"think to tell me that [Farber], along with dozens of others who marched with the Kulanu group, had worn a T-shirt that made its own ironic quip. That's context I sure wish I had known\" and conceded that Zerbisias' comment \"was intended as sarcastic irony, stock in trade for this columnist and blogger.\"\n\nFarber was on leave from the CJC's successor, the Canadian Council for Israel and Jewish Advocacy during his candidacy as the Ontario Liberal Party's nominee in the 2011 Ontario election in the riding of Thornhill. Farber received 40% support but lost to Progressive Conservative Peter Shurman by 2,500 votes.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2015, Farber was the Senior Vice President for Gemini Power Corporation, working in partnership with First Nations to help develop sustainable business economies.\n\nIn 1992, Farber was awarded the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal. The commemorative medal was awarded to 40,000 Canadians for their contributions to community and country.\nFarber also received the Charles \"Chuck\" Zaionz Award for Jewish Communal Service in December 2012 as well as the Queens Diamond Jubilee Medal.\n", "id": "7738633", "categories": ["Canadian Zionists", "Jewish Canadian activists", "1951 births", "Canadian people of Polish-Jewish descent", "Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections", "Living people", "People from Ottawa", "Carleton University alumni"], "title": "Bernie Farber"}

In 1846 the pro-British army leader Sir Jung Bahadur (1816–77) of the Rana family finally overthrew the Nepalese government and declared himself the prime minister. Like many dictatorships, Jung Bahadur's office was passed on through hereditary rather than valid elections. Jung Bahadur launched a successful military campaign in 1855 in Tibet (Nepalese-Tibetan War). But the Nepalese-Tibetan War exhausted Nepal's finances and in 1856 Tibet signed a peace treaty which granted diplomatic and commercial rights to Nepal on the condition that Tibet continue to pay a yearly \"tribute\" to the Nepalese government.\n\nNepal aided Great Britain during the Indian Mutiny and during World War I. The British government in gratitude for Nepal's assistance declared the independence and sovereignty of Nepal to be genuine by the terms of a treaty concluded in 1923.\n\nOn September 4, 1939 Nepal declared war on Germany in solidarity with the Allied Forces, assisting the United Kingdom as they had in World War I and the Indian Mutiny. Twelve regiments of Gurkha soldiers from Nepal were sent to fight in the British Indian Army. Although Britain has been recruiting Gurkha soldiers from Nepal since the 19th century, no effort was made to develop a centralized recruit-training system in the Brigade of Gurkhas throughout the pre Second World War era. As a result, British Army recruiting training was conducted at the various Gurkha regimental training centres in India. After the end of the war, Nepal also established good diplomatic relations with the United States in 1948.\n\nIn February 1996, one of the Maoist parties started a bid to replace the constitutional monarchy and democratic government with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the people's war, which led to the Nepal Civil War. Led by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai and Pushpa Kamal Dahal (also known as \"Prachanda\", fierce in Nepalese), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: Rolpa, Rukum, Jajarkot, Gorkha, and Sindhuli. The Maoists have declared the existence of a provisional \"people's government\" at the district level in several locations\n\nThe various parties of Nepal together conducted an anti-monarchy campaign by demonstrating and chanting slogans, and finally the king was compelled to declare a democracy. After the democracy the parties leaders had thrown out the monarchy and declared the democratic republic of Nepal. The civil war of Nepal caused by the Maoists had been concluded after the Maoists came into the political mainstream. All the Maoists combatants/militias were concentrated in cantonments and verified. Since last 6 years the leaders are engaged in a constitution building process. There had been 2 elections for constitution assembly and first elected constitution assembly members were not able to draft the constitution on time. Now there is a government led by prime-minister Sushil Koirala (Nepali Congress Party) which has the main task of drafting the constitution.\n\n\n", "id": "7738641", "categories": [], "title": "Military history of Nepal"}

Write Award-winning novel by Chart Korbjitti, \"Khamphiphaksa\" (The Judgment, also the English-language title for the film).\n\nA young man, Fak, is a revered novice Buddhist monk, and the entire village has turned out to the local temple to hear him preach a sermon. Fak's talk is interrupted a coughing fit by his widower father, though, and Fak struggles to maintain his focus. Fak then decides he must put aside his aspirations for monkhood to take care of his father. Then he is conscripted by lottery into the army. He hopes that when he completes his national service, he will return to the village, be ordained as a monk and devote his life to religion.\n\nOn his return home from the army, the bus to his village breaks down. During the stop, Fak steps over to the side of the road, near a lotus pond, to urinate. There, among the lotus, he sees a beautiful woman bathing, fully clothed (as is customary in Thailand). Fak zips up and eventually arrives at home, where he finds his father in a very happy state. His father's reason for being so happy is that he has remarried. Fak's stepmother then appears from behind a mosquito net: it's the woman from the lotus pond. Her name is Somsong, and though she is sweet and devoted, there is something clearly wrong with her, perhaps some type of mental illness.\n\nThough there are happy times, with Fak joining his father at work as a janitor for the local school, his reunion with his father is short-lived after his father becomes ill and dies. Because Fak made a promise to his father that he would look after his stepmother, Fak's goal of returning to the monkhood must again be put aside.\n\nThough Fak is well liked in the village, the villagers do not like Somsong and have labeled her \"crazy\". And after Fak's father's death, the villagers start to treat Fak differently: they believe he is having an affair with his stepmother. Fak at first ignores the gossip, but it becomes harder and harder to deny because of Somsong's behavior. On one occasion, during a likay performance at a village fair, Fak is accosted by Somsong after she sees Fak talking with a young woman. Somsong is suffering from delusions that she and Fak are married, and she is jealous. Somsong also has the unfortunate habit of shedding her clothes and running naked in public, or simply lifting her dress and exposing herself. During one of these episodes, some villagers happen upon Fak just as he's chased the nude Somsong down and is attempting to cover her up. But what the villagers think they are witnessing is Fak having sex with his stepmother. Fak has been judged.\n\nFak has taken his father's old job as school janitor. One day a dog that's thought to be rabid wanders onto the school grounds. Fak is given the job of killing it. He grabs a hoe and uses it to strike the animal, hitting it with a glancing blow that only injures it and makes it angrier. Fak eventually finishes the snarling dog off, but it is a bloody task. For a brief moment, Fak is seen as a hero by the students and faculty, and he feels a bit better about himself.\n\nFak must prepare for his father's cremation. He invites the school's headmaster, the village headman and others. He orders 50 sandalwood blossoms for attendees to place on the burning casket. But no one shows up for the ceremony, except for the monks he engaged to chant over his father, and the local undertaker.\n\nFak makes friends with the undertaker, a lowly person who is not well liked by the superstitious villagers because they believe he is unclean. Even Fak didn't particularly like the man, but after Fak tells him that he has never had sexual relations with Somsong, the man believes him.\n\nAfter the cremation rite, the undertaker offers Fak some rice whiskey. Fak at first doesn't like the taste or the way it makes him feel. But he has a few more drinks and starts enjoy himself. Looking for relief from the pressure of taking care of his mentally ill stepmother and the harsh judgment of the villagers, Fak turns to the bottle and becomes an alcoholic. His downward spiral continues until he has angered the villagers, and they turn on him and beat him, leaving him to be assisted home by Somsong.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7738646", "categories": ["2000s drama films", "Thai films", "2004 films", "Films based on Thai novels", "Thai-language films"], "title": "Ai-Fak"}

It was staged in Madison Square Garden in New York City on September 7 and 10, 2001. In late November 2001, the CBS television network aired the concerts as a two-hour special in honor of Michael Jackson's thirtieth year as a solo entertainer (his first solo single, \"Got to Be There\", was recorded in 1971). The show was edited from footage of the two performances. The show was watched by 29.8 million viewers on CBS when it aired later the same year.\n\nThe shows sold out in 2 hours. Ticket prices were among the most expensive ever for an event; the best seats cost $20,000 and included a dinner with Michael Jackson and a signed poster. The show was choreographed by Glenn Douglas Packard and Brian Thomas, who were nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography. It was presented by David Gest, World Events LLC and Clear Channel Entertainment in conjunction with American Airlines, American Eagle and Amazon. Jackson reportedly earned $7.5 million for each of the two concerts. The concert official Boxscore was $10,072,105 for both concerts.\n\nTo some fans, Jackson appeared more disoriented in the first concert as he only did one short moonwalk and improvised the ending of the \"Billie Jean\" performance. In 2011, presenter David Gest claimed that Jackson was on drugs during the concerts in the documentary \"\". However, Jackson himself said that he had not rehearsed for the first concert. In his book \"You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes\", brother Jermaine Jackson said that Jackson was taking Demerol, a pain relieving medicine with psychotropic effects. The show attracted numerous celebrities, including basketball players, actors, and other musicians.\n\nThis concert would also be the final one where Jackson performed with his brothers onstage.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Jackson along with his personal assistant Frank Cascio was scheduled for a meeting at the World Trade Center, to return a \"two million\" dollar watch Jackson used for the concert, and a diamond necklace for Elizabeth Taylor, but overslept and did not make it. In the aftermath of the attacks, Jackson sponsored a charity concert titled . The concerts were held in Washington, D.C. and New York City. Other featured artists that also performed in the benefit concert were the Backstreet Boys, Krystal Harris, Huey Lewis and the News, James Brown, Jennifer Lopez, Billy Gilman, O-Town, Usher, Christina Milian, Carole King, Al Green, Christina Aguilera, Pink, Bette Midler, CeCe Peniston, Aerosmith, America, P. Diddy, NSYNC, Destiny's Child, Rod Stewart, Goo Goo Dolls, Train, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, and Mary J. Blige. In addition, his sister Janet Jackson performed with him. \n\nThis event marked Randy Jackson's final concert with his brothers. He would contribute backup vocals for Jackson's final song, This is It, along with his brothers Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine, before announcing his retirement from entertainment. From 2012-13, the remaining brothers (without Randy or Michael) reunited for the Unity Tour, which was held in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania.\n\nMichael Jackson; 30th Anniversary Special\n\n\n\n\nBackground Singers-Jason Paige, Michael McElroy, Shoshana Bean, Luther Creek, Melanie Daniels, \n\n", "id": "7738905", "categories": ["2001 in American music", "2001 in New York City", "2000s American television specials", "Madison Square Garden", "2001 in American television", "CBS television specials", "Michael Jackson concerts", "2001 television specials"], "title": "Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration"}

This roadside attraction has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1988. Much like the architecture found in such structures as the Benewah Milk Bottle, the Teapot Dome Service Station or the comparably colossal Dinosaur Park sculptures in South Dakota, it served to attract the attention of motorists passing by and coincided with the dramatic rise in the popularity of automobiles.\n\nThe statues have been hailed by the Kodak Company as the \"second most photographed statues in the United States\", behind only Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.\n\nThe city of Bemidji is located in a vast woodland and lake region. As early as the 1890s the town saw a modest tourist trade. When rail connections came to Bemidji, in 1898, promoters began the development of lakeshore sites for cottages, hotels and resorts. Most of these resorts catered to hunters and anglers. In the 1920s the rise in automobile popularity contributed to a significant boom in Bemidji's tourist industry, but it, along with the rest of the economy, suffered during the Great Depression. Enter Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.\n\nAs a means of stimulating tourism in Bemidji a number of local, civic organizations sponsored a winter carnival meant to hype the city's resources for winter sports. Due to Bemidji's once prominent status as a logging and lumbering center the celebrations focused on Paul Bunyan, the larger-than life lumberjack who is an American folk hero. On January 14, 1937 the carnival opened with Earl L. Grinols, Sr. the carnival king. The onset of the carnival brought the unveiling of two giant statues, one of Bunyan and the other of his giant blue ox, Babe; the pair would serve as carnival mascots. Babe was brought into town on a Grinols Implement & Fuel Co. truck arranged so that its exhaust exited through Babe's nostrils.\n\nIn March 2006, the Rotary Club of Bemidji raised $53,000 and along with a $68,000 federal grant set about to repair some damage to the statues. In addition the money was to be used in maintenance with the majority slated for stabilizing the ground beneath the statues, to lessen shifting in freezing temperatures. The work also focused on a crack in Babe from the neck to the hindquarters which continued to widen despite yearly fixes by the city with caulk and blue paint.\n\nIn October of 2013, local organizers ran the first Bemidji Blue Ox Marathon and planned the course to run past the statues.\n\n\"Paul Bunyan\" is approximately tall and measures across at his base.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739036", "text": "Military history of South Africa\n\nThe military history of South Africa chronicles a vast time period and complex events from the dawn of history until the present time. It covers civil wars and wars of aggression and of self-defence both within South Africa and against it. It includes the history of battles fought in the territories of modern South Africa in neighbouring territories, in both world wars and in modern international conflicts.\n\nBefore the arrival of any European settlers in South Africa the Southern part of Africa was inhabited by the San people. As far as military history of South Africa is concerned, African tribes frequently waged war against each other and made alliances for survival. The succession of Bantu immigrants from Central Africa during the time of the Bantu expansion initially led to the formation of merged tribes such as the Masarwa. After some time Bantu immigrants of greater strength invaded much of the traditional San territories. Archeological research suggests that each Bantu succession had better weapons than their predecessors enabling them to dominate the eastern parts of South Africa thereby forcing the Khoisan into less desirable parts of the country. \n\nAbout the middle of the 18th century several clashes occurred between the Khoisan and the advancing Bantu tribes known as the Batlapin and the more powerful Barolong. These invaders would take as slaves those who had been conquered and referred to them as the Balala. During battle the defenders were armed with strong bows, and poisoned arrows; they also used the assegai and battle-axe, and protected their bodies with a small shield. In a fight in the open plain they had little chance in defeating the invaders, though when attacked on a mountain or among rocks they managed to beat of their enemies.\n\nThe arrival of the permanent settlements of the Dutch East India Company at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652 brought them face to face with the local people, such as the Khoikhoi (called Hottentots by the Dutch), the San (Bushmen) and some Bantu peoples of South Africa. While the Dutch traded with the Khoikhoi, nevertheless serious disputes broke out over land ownership and livestock. This resulted in attacks and counter-attacks by both sides which were known as the Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars. The First Khoikhoi-Dutch War took place in 1659, the second in 1673 and the third in 1674–1677.\n\nDuring 1664, tensions between England and the Netherlands rose with rumours of war being imminent – that same year, Commander Zacharius Wagenaer was instructed to build a pentagonal castle out of stone at . On 26 April 1679, the five bastions were built. The Castle of Good Hope is a fortification which was built on the original coastline of Table Bay and now, because of land reclamation, seems nearer the centre of Cape Town, South Africa. Built by the VOC between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the oldest building in South Africa. The Castle acted as local headquarters for the South African Army in the Western Cape, but today houses the Castle Military Museum and ceremonial facilities for the traditional Cape Regiments.\n\nThe Battle of Muizenberg was a small but significant battle for the future destiny of South Africa which took place at Muizenberg (near Cape Town), South Africa in 1795; it led to the capture of the Cape Colony by the United Kingdom. A fleet of seven Royal Navy ships – five third-rates, \"Monarch\" (74), \"Victorious\" (74), \"Arrogant\" (74), \"America\" (64) and \"Stately\" (64), with the 16-gun sloops \"Echo\" and \"Rattlesnake\" – under Vice-Admiral Elphinstone anchored in Simon's Bay at the Cape of Good Hope in June 1795, having left England on 1 March. Their commander suggested to the Dutch governor that he place the Cape Colony under the protection of the British monarch – in effect, that he hand the colony over to Britain – which was refused. Simon's Town was occupied on 14 June by a force of 350 Royal Marines and 450 men of the 78th Highlanders, before the defenders could burn the town. Following skirmishes on 1 and 2 September, a final general attempt to recapture the camp was prepared by the Dutch for the 3rd, but at this point the British reinforcements arrived and the Dutch withdrew. A British advance on Cape Town, with the new reinforcements, began on the 14th; on the 16th, the colony capitulated.\n\nThe British assumed control of the Cape of Good Hope for the next seven years. The Cape was returned to the restored Dutch government (known as the Batavian Government) in 1804. In 1806 the British returned and after again defeating the Dutch at the Battle of Blaauwberg, stayed in control for more than 100 years.\n\nThe Xhosa Wars (also known as the \"Kaffir Wars\" or \"Cape Frontier Wars\") were a series of nine wars between parts of the Xhosa people, and European settlers with their Xhosa allies, from 1779 and 1879 in what is now the Eastern Cape in South Africa. The wars were responsible for the Xhosa people's loss of most of their land, and the incorporation of its people into European-controlled territories.\n\nThe Ndwandwe-Zulu War of 1817–1819 was a war fought between the expanding Zulu kingdom and the Ndwandwe tribe in South Africa. Shaka revolutionised traditional ways of fighting by introducing the assegai, a spear with a short shaft and broad blade, used as a close-quarters stabbing weapon. (Under Shaka's rule, losing an assegai was punishable by death. So it was never thrown like a javelin.) He also organised warriors into disciplined units known as \"Impis\" that fought in close formation behind large cowhide shields. In the Battle of Gqokli Hill in 1819, his troops and tactics prevailed over the superior numbers of the Ndwandwe people, who failed to destroy the Zulu in their first encounter.\n\nThe Ndwandwe and the Zulus met again in combat at the Battle of Mhlatuze River in 1820. The Zulu tactics again prevailed, pressing their attack when the Ndwandwe army was divided during the crossing of the Mhlatuze River. Zulu warriors arrived at the Ndwande King Zwide's headquarters near present-day Nongoma before news of the defeat, and approached the camp singing Ndwandwe victory songs to gain entry. Zwide fled with some of his offspring including Madzanga. Most of the Ndwandwe abandoned their lands and migrated north and eastward. This was the start of the Mfecane, a catastrophic, bloody migration of many different tribes in the area, initially escaping the Zulus, but themselves causing their own havoc after adopting Zulu tactics in war. Shaka was the ultimate victor, and his (more peaceful) descendants still live today throughout Zululand, with customs and a way of life that can be easily traced to Shaka's day.\n\nMfecane (Zulu), also known as the Difaqane or Lifaqane (Sesotho), is an African expression which means something like \"the crushing\" or \"scattering\". It describes a period of widespread chaos and disturbance in southern Africa during the period between 1815 and about 1835.\n\nThe Mfecane resulted from the rise to power of Shaka, the Zulu king and military leader who conquered the Nguni peoples between the Tugela and Pongola rivers in the beginning of the 19th century, and created a militaristic kingdom in the region. The Mfecane also led to the formation and consolidation of other groups – such as the Matabele, the Mfengu and the Makololo – and the creation of states such as the modern Lesotho.\n\nThe Battle of Italeni in what is now KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in early 1838, between the Voortrekkers and the Zulus during the period of the Great Trek, resulted in the Zulu armies repulsing the Voortrekkers. On 9 April, near the Babanango Mountain Range a large Zulu impi (army) appeared, consisting of approximately 8,000 warriors. The Voortrekker commandos returned to their camp on 12 April. Boer general Piet Uys formed a raiding party of fifteen volunteers (including his son, Dirkie Uys.) During subsequent fighting Uys, his son, the Malan brothers as well as five of the volunteers were killed, and the Voortrekkers were forced to retreat. It has been speculated that, without the lessons learnt as a result of the Battle of Italeni – such as fighting from the shelter of ox-wagons whenever possible and choosing the place of battle rather than being enticed into unfavourable terrain – the Voortrekkers would not have succeeded in finally beating the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River eight months later.\n\nThe Battle of Blood River () was fought on 16 December 1838 on the banks of the Blood River (\"Bloedrivier\") in what is today KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. In the aftermath of the Weenen massacre, a group of about 470 Voortrekkers, led by Andries Pretorius, defended a \"laager\" (circle of ox wagons) against Zulu impis, ruled by King Dingane and led by Dambuza (Nzobo) and Ndlela kaSompisi, numbering between 10 and 20 thousand. The Zulus repeatedly and unsuccessfully attacked the \"laager\", until Pretorius ordered a group of horse riders to leave the encampment and engage the Zulus. Partly due to the fact that the Voortrekkers used rifles and at least one light cannon against the Zulus' spears, as well as the good location and motivation of the Voortrekkers, only three Voortrekkers were wounded and none perished; that contrasted against the more than 3,000 Zulu warriors who died. The Voortrekkers credited God as the reason why they had won the battle as they had made a covenant asking for protection beforehand.\n\nThe Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between Britain and the Zulus, and signalled the end of the Zulus as an independent nation. It was precipitated by Sir Bartle Frere High Commissioner for Southern Africa who manufactured a casus belli and prepared an invasion without the approval of Her Majesty's government.\n\nAt the Battle of Isandlwana (22 January 1879), the Zulu overwhelmed and wiped out 1,400 British soldiers. This battle is considered to be one of the greatest disasters in British colonial history. Isandlwana forced the policy makers in London to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulu. The first invasion of Zululand ended with the catastrophe of Isandlwana where, along with heavy casualties, the main centre column lost all supplies, transport and ammunition and the British would be forced to halt their advances elsewhere while a new invasion was prepared. At Rorke's Drift (22–23 January 1879) 139 British soldiers successfully defended the station against an intense assault by four to five thousand Zulu warriors.\n\nThe Battle of Intombe was fought on 12 March 1879, between British and Zulu forces. The Siege of Eshowe took place during a three-pronged attack on the Impis of Cetshwayo at Ulundi. The Battle of Gingindlovu (uMgungundlovu) was fought between a British relief column sent to break the Siege of Eshowe and the Impis of Cetshwayo on 2 April 1879. The battle restored the British commanders' confidence in their army and their ability to defeat Zulu. With the last resistance removed, they were able to advance and relieve Eshowe. The Battle of Hlobane was a total disaster for the British; 15 officers and 110 men were killed, a further 8 wounded and 100 native soldiers died. The Battle of Kambula took place in 1879 when a Zulu army attacked the British camp at Kambula, resulting in a massive Zulu defeat. The Battle of Ulundi took place at the Zulu capital of Ulundi on 4 July 1879 and proved to be the decisive battle that finally broke the military power of the Zulu nation.\n\nThe First Boer War, also known as the First Anglo-Boer War or the Transvaal War, was fought from 16 December 1880 until 23 March 1881 and was the first clash between the British and the South African Republic (Z.A.R.) Boers. It was precipitated by Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who annexed the South African Republic (Transvaal Republic) for the British in 1877. The British consolidated their power over most of the colonies of South Africa in 1879 after the Anglo-Zulu War, and attempted to impose an unpopular system of confederation on the region. The Boers protested, and in December 1880 they revolted.\nThe battles of Bronkhorstspruit, Laing's Nek, Schuinshoogte, and Majuba Hill proved disastrous for the British where they found themselves outmaneuvered and outperformed by the highly mobile and skilled Boer marksmen. With the British commander-in-chief of Natal, George Pomeroy Colley, killed at Majuba, and British garrisons under siege across the entire Transvaal, the British were unwilling to further involve themselves in a war which was already seen as lost. As a result, William Gladstone's British government signed a truce on 6 March, and in the final peace treaty on 23 March 1881, gave the Boers self-government in the South African Republic (Transvaal) under a theoretical British oversight.\n\nThe Jameson Raid (29 December 1895 – 2 January 1896) was a raid on Paul Kruger's Transvaal Republic carried out by Leander Starr Jameson and his Rhodesian and Bechuanaland policemen over the New Year weekend of 1895–96. It was intended to trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate workers (known as Uitlanders, or in English \"Foreigners\") in the Transvaal but failed to do so. Though the raid was ineffective and no uprising took place, it did much to bring about the Second Boer War and the Second Matabele War.\n\nThe affair brought Anglo-Boer relations to a dangerous low, and the ill feeling was heightened by the \"Kruger telegram\" from the German Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II. It congratulated Paul Kruger for defeating the raid, as well as appearing to recognise the Boer republic and offer support. The emperor was already perceived as anti-British, and a naval arms race had started between Germany and Britain. Consequently, the telegram alarmed and angered the British.\n\nThe Second Boer War, also known as the Second Anglo-Boer War, the Second Freedom War (Afrikaans) and referred to as the South African War in modern times took place from 11 October 1899 – 31 May 1902. The war was fought between Great Britain and the two independent Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (referred to as the Transvaal by the British). After a protracted hard-fought war, the two independent republics lost and were absorbed into the British Empire.\n\nIn all, the war had cost around 75,000 lives – 22,000 British soldiers (7,792 battle casualties, the rest through disease), 6,000–7,000 Boer Commandos, 20,000–28,000 Boer civilians, mostly women and children due to disease in concentration camps, and an estimated 20,000 black Africans, Boer allies, who died in their own separate concentration camps. The last of the Boer forces surrendered in May 1902 and the war ended with the Treaty of Vereeniging in the same month. The war resulted in the creation of the Transvaal Colony which in 1910 was incorporated into the Union of South Africa. The treaty ended the existence of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State as Boer republics and placed them within the British Empire.\n\nThe Boers referred to the two wars as the \"Freedom Wars\". Those Boers who wanted to continue the fight were known as \"\"bitter-einders\"\" (or \"irreconcilables\") and at the end of the war a number like Deneys Reitz chose exile rather than sign an undertaking that they would abide by the peace terms. Over the following decade, many returned to South Africa and never signed the undertaking. Some, like Reitz, eventually reconciled themselves to the new \"status quo\", but others waited for a suitable opportunity to restart the old quarrel. At the start of World War I the bitter-einders and their allies took part in a revolt known as the Maritz Rebellion.\n\nThe Union of South Africa, which came into being in 1910, tied closely to the British Empire, joined Great Britain and the allies against the German Empire. Both Prime Minister Louis Botha and Defence Minister Jan Smuts, both former Second Boer War generals who had fought against the British then, but who now became active and respected members of the Imperial War Cabinet. (See Jan Smuts during World War I.)\n\nThe Union Defence Force was part of significant military operations against Germany. In spite of Boer resistance at home, the Afrikaner-led government of Louis Botha joined the side of the Allies of World War I and fought alongside its armies. The South African Government agreed to the withdrawal of British Army units so that they were free to join the European war, and laid plans to invade German South-West Africa. Elements of the South African army refused to fight against the Germans and along with other opponents of the Government rose in open revolt. The government declared martial law on 14 October 1914, and forces loyal to the government under the command of General Louis Botha and Jan Smuts proceeded to destroy the Maritz Rebellion. The leading Boer rebels got off lightly with terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines. (See World War I and the Maritz Rebellion.)\n\nThe Union Defence Force saw action in a number of places:\n\n\nMore than 146,000 whites, 83,000 blacks and 2,500 people of mixed race (\"Coloureds\") and Asians served in South African military units during the war, including 43,000 in German South-West Africa and 30,000 on the Western Front. An estimated 3,000 South Africans also joined the Royal Flying Corps. The total South African casualties during the war was about 18,600 with over 12,452 killed – more than 4,600 in the European theatre alone.\nThe Commonwealth War Graves commission has records of 9457 known South African War dead during World War I. \n\nThere is no question that South Africa greatly assisted the Allies, and Great Britain in particular, in capturing the two German colonies of German South West Africa and German East Africa as well as in battles in Western Europe and the Middle East. South Africa's ports and harbours, such as at Cape Town, Durban, and Simon's Town, were also important rest-stops, refuelling-stations, and served as strategic assets to the British Royal Navy during the war, helping to keep the vital sea lanes to the British Raj open.\n\nOn the eve of World War II the Union of South Africa found itself in a unique political and military quandary. While it was closely allied with Great Britain, being a co-equal Dominion under the 1931 Statute of Westminster with its head of state being the British king, the South African Prime Minister on 1 September 1939 was none other than Barry Hertzog the leader of the pro-Afrikaner anti-British National party that had joined in a unity government as the United Party.\n\nHertzog's problem was that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against Nazi Germany. The Polish-British Common Defence Pact obligated Britain, and in turn its dominions, to help Poland if attacked by the Nazis. After Hitler's forces attacked Poland in the morning of 1 September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany within a few days. A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa, especially in the halls of power in the Parliament of South Africa, that pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britain's side, led by the pro-Allied pro-British Afrikaner and former Prime Minister Jan Smuts and General \"against\" then-current Prime Minister Barry Hertzog who wished to keep South Africa \"neutral\", if not pro-Axis.\n\nOn 4 September 1939, the United Party caucus refused to accept Hertzog's stance of neutrality in World War II and deposed him in favour of Smuts. Upon becoming Prime Minister of South Africa, Smuts declared South Africa officially at war with Germany and the Axis. Smuts immediately set about fortifying South Africa against any possible German sea invasion because of South Africa's global strategic importance controlling the long sea route around the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nSmuts took severe action against the pro-Nazi South African Ossewabrandwag movement (they were caught committing acts of sabotage) and jailed its leaders for the duration of the war. (One of them, John Vorster, was to become future Prime Minister of South Africa.) (See Jan Smuts during World War II.)\n\nPrime Minister Jan Smuts was the only important non-British general whose advice was constantly sought by Britain's war-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet in 1939 as the most senior South African in favour of war. On 28 May 1941, Smuts was appointed a Field Marshal of the British Army, becoming the first South African to hold that rank. Ultimately, Smuts would pay a steep political price for his closeness to the British establishment, to the King, and to Churchill which had made Smuts very unpopular among the conservative nationalistic Afrikaners, leading to his eventual downfall, whereas most English-speaking whites and a minority of liberal Afrikaners in South Africa remained loyal to him. (See Jan Smuts during World War II.)\n\nSouth Africa and its military forces contributed in many theatres of war. South Africa's contribution consisted mainly of supplying troops, airmen and material for the North African campaign (the Desert War) and the Italian Campaign as well as to Allied ships that docked at its crucial ports adjoining the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean that converge at the tip of Southern Africa. Numerous volunteers also flew for the Royal Air Force. (See: South African Army in World War II; South African Air Force in World War II; South African Navy in World War II.)\n\n\nOf the 334,000 men volunteered for full-time service in the South African Army during the war (including some 211,000 whites, 77,000 blacks and 46,000 \"coloureds\" and Asians), nearly 9,000 were killed in action.\n\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission has records of 11,023 known South African war dead during World War II.\n\nHowever, not all South Africans supported the war effort. The Anglo-Boer war had ended only thirty five years earlier and to some, siding with the \"enemy\" was considered disloyal and unpatriotic. These sentiments gave rise to \"The Ossewabrandwag\" (\"Oxwagon Sentinel\"), originally created as a cultural organisation on the Centenary of the \"Great Trek\" becoming more militant and openly opposing South African entry into the war on side of the British. The organisation created a paramilitary group called \"Stormjaers\" ('storm chasers'), modelled on the Nazi SA or \"Sturmabteilung\" (\"Storm Division\") and which was linked to the German Intelligence (\"Abwehr\") and the German Foreign Office (\"Dienstelle Ribbentrop\") via Dr. Luitpold Werz – the former German Consul in Pretoria. The \"Stormjaers\" carried out a number of sabotage attacks against the Smuts government and actively tried to intimidate and discourage volunteers from joining the army recruitment programs.\n\nIn the Korean War, the 2 Squadron (\"The Flying Cheetahs\") took part as South Africa's contribution. It won many American decorations, including the honour of a United States Presidential Unit Citation in 1952:\n\nSome sources list 35 deaths from 2 Squadron.\n\nThe Simonstown Agreement was a naval co-operation agreement between the United Kingdom and South Africa signed 30 June 1955. Under the agreement, the Royal Navy gave up its naval base at Simonstown, South Africa, and transferred command of the South African Navy to the government of South Africa. In return, South Africa promised the use of the Simonstown base to Royal Navy ships.\n\nU.S. Intelligence believed that Israel participated in South African nuclear research projects and supplied advanced non-nuclear weapons technology to South Africa during the 1970s, while South Africa was developing its own atomic bombs.\nAccording to David Albright, writing for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, \"Faced with sanctions, South Africa began to organize clandestine procurement networks in Europe and the United States, and it began a long, secret collaboration with Israel.\" although he goes on to say \"A common question is whether Israel provided South Africa with weapons design assistance, although available evidence argues against significant cooperation.\" According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, in 1977 Israel traded 30 grams of tritium in exchange for 50 tons of South African uranium and in the mid-80s assisted with the development of the RSA-3 ballistic missile. Also in 1977, according to foreign press reports, it was suspected that South Africa signed a pact with Israel that included the transfer of military technology and the manufacture of at least six atom bombs.\n\nChris McGreal has claimed that \"Israel provided expertise and technology that was central to South Africa's development of its nuclear bombs\". In 2000, Dieter Gerhardt, Soviet spy and a former commodore in the South African Navy, claimed that Israel agreed in 1974 to arm eight Jericho II missiles with \"special warheads\" for South Africa.\n\n\nBetween 1966 and 1989, South Africa waged a long and bitter counter-insurgency campaign against the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) in South-West Africa. PLAN was backed by the Soviet Union and a number of Warsaw Pact member states, as well as several sympathetic, newly independent African governments. It also received considerable combat support from the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and a sizeable contingent of Cuban military advisors. In response, South Africa underwent a massive military expansion to combat the PLAN threat, which included the formation of several elite special forces units such as Koevoet, 32 Battalion, and the Reconnaissance Commando Regiment. South African troops raided neighbouring states to strike at PLAN forward operating bases, which occasionally entailed clashes with FAPLA and the Zambian Defence Force. This largely undeclared conflict became known as the South African Border War during the late 1970s.\n\nSADF expeditionary forces targeted guerrilla bases, refugees, and rural infrastructure in Angola and Zambia, depending initially on border raids, patrols, and air strikes to keep PLAN at bay. This was eventually extended to a permanent SADF military presence throughout southern Angola, with the objective of forcing PLAN bases to relocate further and further north. While this strategy was successful, it resulted in the parallel expansion of FAPLA, with Soviet assistance, to meet what Luanda perceived as a direct South African threat to Angolan sovereignty. FAPLA and the SADF clashed continuously between 1981 and 1984, and again from 1987 to 1988, culminating in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale.\n\nThe South African Border War was closely linked to the Angolan Civil War. South African expeditionary units had openly invaded Angola in 1975 during \"Operation Savannah\", an ill-fated attempt to support two rival Angolan factions, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), during the civil war. The SADF was forced to withdraw under overwhelming pressure from thousands of Cuban combat troops. When South Africa began intensifying its campaign against PLAN in the 1980s, it reasserted its alliance with UNITA and took the opportunity to bolster that movement with training and captured PLAN weaponry.\n\nThe Battle of Cuito Cuanavale proved to be a major turning point for both conflicts, as it resulted in the Angolan Tripartite Accord, in which Cuba pledged to withdraw its troops from Angola while South Africa withdrew from South-West Africa. South-West Africa received independence as the Republic of Namibia in 1990.\n\nSouth Africa has produced a variety of significant weapons, vehicles and planes for its own uses as well as for international export. Some have been established weapons produced under licence and in other instances South Africa has innovated and manufactured its own weapons and vehicles. The predominant manufacturer of weapons is Denel.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Armscor produced a great deal of South Africa's armament as South Africa was under UN sanctions. It was during this time that Armscor contracted with Gerald Bull's Space Research Corporation for advanced 155mm howitzer designs, which it eventually produced, used, and exported to countries such as Iraq.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, it was common for anti-apartheid political movements to form military wings, such as Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), which was created by the African National Congress, and the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) of the Pan-Africanist Congress. These functioned as \"de facto\" guerrilla armies, carrying out acts of sabotage and waging a limited rural insurgency. The guerrillas occasionally clashed with each other as their respective political organs jockeyed for internal influence.\n\nThough fought on a much smaller scale than the South African Border War, the SADF's operations against MK and APLA mirrored several important aspects of that conflict. Much like PLAN, for example, MK often sought sanctuary in states adjacent to South Africa's borders. The SADF retaliated with targeted assassinations of MK personnel on foreign soil, and a combination of air strikes and special forces raids on MK bases in Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana, and Lesotho.\n\nBoth MK and APLA were disbanded and integrated with the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) following the abolition of apartheid.\n\nThe Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) – \"Afrikaner Resistance Movement\" – was formed in 1973 in Heidelberg, Transvaal, a town southeast of Johannesburg. It is a political and paramilitary group in South Africa and was under the leadership of Eugène Terre'Blanche. They are committed to the restoration of an independent Afrikaner republic or \"\"Boerestaat\"\" within South Africa. In their heyday, the period of transition in the early 1990s, they received much publicity both in South Africa and abroad as an extremist white supremacist group.\n\nDuring the Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa, the AWB stormed the venue, the Kempton Park World Trade Centre, breaking through the glass front of the building with an armoured car. The invaders took over the main conference hall, threatening delegates and painting slogans on the walls and left again after a short period.\nIn 1994, before the advent of majority rule, the AWB again gained international notoriety in its attempt to defend the dictatorial government of Lucas Mangope in the homeland of Bophuthatswana, who opposed the upcoming elections and the dissolution of \"his\" homeland. The AWB, along with a contingent of about 90 Afrikaner Volksfront militiamen entered the capital of Mmabatho on 10 and 11 March.\nTerre'Blanche was sentenced for the attempted murder of security guard, Paul Motshabi, but he only served three years. In June 2004, he was released from prison. Terre'blanche claimed that while in prison, he re-discovered God and has dropped some of his more violent and racist policies. He preached reconciliation as 'prescribed by God' in his later years. Terre'Blanche was murdered on his farm on 3 April 2010.\n\nThe South African National Defence Force (SANDF) is the name of the present-day armed forces of South Africa. The military as it exists today was created in 1994, following South Africa's first post-apartheid national elections and the adoption of a new constitution. It replaced the South African Defence Force (SADF), and included personnel and equipment from the SADF and the former Homelands forces (Transkei, Venda, Bophuthatswana, and Ciskei), as well as personnel from the former guerrilla forces of some of the political parties involved in South Africa, such as the African National Congress's Umkhonto we Sizwe, the Pan Africanist Congress's APLA and the Self-Protection Units of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).\n\nAs of 2004, the integration process was considered complete, with the integrated personnel having been incorporated into a slightly modified structure very similar to that of the SADF, with the latter's structure and equipment for the most part being retained.\n\nThe commander of the SANDF is appointed by the President from one of the armed services. The current commander is General Solly Shoke. He in turn is accountable to the Minister of Defence, currently Nosiviwe Noluthando Mapisa-Nqakula.\n\nSome of the Traditional South African Regiments have been serving the country for over a hundred and fifty years under various iterations of political systems and different governments.\n\nThe South African Department of Defence's Strategic Defence Acquisition (known as the Arms Deal) aimed to modernise its defence equipment, which included the purchase of corvettes, submarines, light utility helicopters, lead-in fighter trainers and advanced light fighter aircraft. This saw the SANDF being provided with modern equipment.\n\nRecent peacekeeping actions on the behalf of the South African military include the South African intervention in Lesotho in order to restore the democratically elected government after a coup, as well as extensive contributions to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi. An operation to Sudan has recently begun and is scheduled to be increased to Brigade strength.\n\nIssues that face the SANDF include a severe shortage of pilots and naval combat officers, due to the replacement of white officers from the former SADF with appointments from the old liberation forces and emigration. The loss of trained personnel and the decommissioning of much needed equipment due to funding issues, high HIV-rates amongst personnel and the fact that SANDF infantry soldiers are some of the oldest in the world, all raise questions regarding the current fighting efficiency of the SANDF. Some of these issues are being addressed with the introduction of the Military Skills Development (MSD) programme, as well as aggressive recruitment and training by the Reserve Force Regiments.\n\nRecently, the SANDF has been involved in combat in both the Central African Republic (Bangui) as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FIB)). The performance of the SANDF soldiers in combat in these two theatres has gone a long way towards silencing critics of the combat effectiveness of the actual soldiers but has refocused the debate on that of the political leadership as well as the procurement and recruitment issues that still abound.\n\nFour armed services make up the forces of the SANDF:\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7739036", "categories": ["Military history of South Africa"], "title": "Military history of South Africa"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739054", "text": "History of Pocklington\n\nThe town of Pocklington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England has a recorded written history that goes back around 1,500 years, and archaeological evidence shows settlement at the site as long as 2,500 years ago. This gives it a longer history of settlement than larger contemporary settlements in the region and country such as York and even London. During this time, it has experienced plague, several invasions, the loss of its railway, and its marginalisation to a backwater under the Romans. Nevertheless, Pocklington has prospered where other market towns have failed. It has always been the commercial and civic centre for the district and was at one point the second largest settlement in Yorkshire. It is the focal point of an area which has seen significant events through the centuries, many influencing English history.\n\nPocklington gets its name via the Old English \"Poclintun\" from the Anglian settlement of Pocel's (or Pocela's) people and the Old English word \"tun\" meaning farm or settlement [A D Mills, \"The Popular Dictionary of English Place-Names\"], but though the town's name can only be traced back to around 650 AD, the inhabitation of Pocklington as a site is thought to extend back a further 1000 years or more to the Bronze Age.\n\nIt is not known exactly when there was first a settlement at Pocklington – archaeologists have found Iron Age remains in and around the town and many Bronze Age burials and other finds have been discovered in the neighbourhood. More recently in 2016 builders uncovered an earlier, Bronze Age, settlement, dating to around 800 BC.\n\nIn 1937, wooden planks belonging to an ancient boat were discovered by a local man in nearby Ferriby. Originally estimated to date from 1300 BC, newer estimates using radiocarbon dating have placed the boats between the years 1890 BC to 1700 BC.\n\nCertainly the Wolds area as a whole was a very attractive location for settlements to ancient man, who preferred to stay clear of the poorly drained and often flooded neighbouring vales – before the draining of a lot of land in the medieval era the flat land to the west and south of Pocklington was very marshy.\n\nArchaeologists have experienced problems in recovering early remains and artefacts from the area intact because of the damage and disruption caused by centuries of arable land use – one skeleton discovered in 2005 was intact apart from its skull, which had been sheared off and crushed by a plough.\n\nPtolemy relates that the Parisii, an ancient Briton tribe (with branches in France, and after which Paris itself is named) inhabited a large part of what is now the East Riding of Yorkshire in the late Iron Age (50 BC) [Ptolemy, \"Geography\"]. They were probably displaced to Britain by population movements on the continent. It is possible that Pocklington was settled by the Parisii as early as the 5th century BC, but certainly by the time the Parisii participated in the general rising of Vercingetorix against Julius Caesar in 52 BC there is strong evidence that their regional capital was based at Pocklington itself.\n\nArcheology has also discovered a substantial late Iron Age settlement of roundhouses in nearby Hayton.\n\nIt is during the era of the Roman occupation that Pocklington suffered something of a reversal in its development. It was eclipsed by York as the prominent settlement within the Yorkshire region, with the City of York effectively beginning its life during this era and swiftly eclipsing Pocklignton in size and importance. Despite Pocklington's existing status and size at the time, York was favoured as the site of the Roman city Eboracum in around 71 AD. It is thought to have been selected, whilst Pocklington was ignored, because of its better water access (River Ouse, accessible via Humber estuary) and because it was a naturally crossing point on a plain of routes from all directions.\n\nDespite Ermine Street (the primary Roman arterial road north from London) running close by Pocklington, the town was not garrisoned by Roman forces. A legionary barracks and important Roman town were constructed in York, which was for several years the home of the Roman Imperial Court and effectively the centre of administration for the Roman Empire, but Pocklington likely remained a Roman-influenced but little altered Iron Age settlement. There is archaeological evidence for some signs of Romanization (cultural) in Pocklington, including a Roman-style bath-house.\n\nThe Roman name for Pocklington is not known but it is thought that Pocklington might be the presently unlocated \"Delgovicia\", meaning \"out of the way place\" or, literally, backwater. However, Millington and Malton are competing candidates for this place-name also. By the time Ptolemy wrote his \"Geography\" in approximately 140 AD, he made no mention of Pocklington but instead referred to the capital of the Romano-British Parisi as being located in \"Petuaria\", near modern-day Brough. Given that the Parisi themselves were non-literate and Ptolemy was writing at some remove, it is difficult now to know whether their capital shifted from Pocklington to Brough, or whether it was always at Pocklington, or always at Brough.\n\nAround this time, the Roman authorities raised an irregular auxiliary unit from the area, known as the Company of Newcomers [Collingwood & Wright, \"The Roman Inscriptions of Britain\"].\n\nThere is also evidence of a Roman villa just outside Pocklington, and although it is not known who occupied it, is suspected to have been a Romano-British chief.\n\nIn 2004 diggers excavating the site near Pocklington unearthed fragments of a human skeleton which almost certainly dated back to Roman times. A quantity of Roman era pottery dating back to between 70 AD and 410 AD has also been uncovered scattered across the same field.\n\nIt is known that at least as early as the 4th century large tracts of land in the Pocklington area and the Wolds were granted to Germanic \"Foederati\" – continental warlords (possibly of the Alemanni) who were given areas of farmland in return for military service. It is not known to what extent this influx replaced or mingled with the earlier inhabitants.\n\nIt was some time before 650 AD that Pocklington gained its current name, meaning \"farmstead belonging to Pocela's people\". It is not known what name Pocklington was known by before that date.\n\nIt is reputed that the ancient kingdom of Deira has its capital nearby. It is likely that the missionary Paulinus established the first Christian church in Pocklington on his way from Goodmanham to found York Minster. Certainly, the Sotheby Cross, dating from the late 14th century in the churchyard at All Saints' Church, has the inscription \"Paulinus here preached and celebrated AD627\".\n\nThe Great Heathen Army of the Vikings captured much of the area in 866, and, in 876, their remnants settled permanently in parts of the Yorkshire countryside. Viking kings ruled this area, known to historians as \"The Viking Kingdom of Jorvik\", for almost a century. In 954, the last Viking king, Eric Bloodaxe, was expelled and his kingdom was incorporated in the newly consolidated Anglo-Saxon state.\n\nMany English towns are able to find mention of themselves in the Domesday Book, William the Conqueror's catalogue of the country. Even before the Norman Conquest, however, records of Pocklington are found in taxation census' of Anglo Saxon kings.\n\nPocklington steadily evolved from Anglo Saxon times as the centre of the surrounding agricultural area. Before the Norman conquest, when King Harold's brother-in-law Earl Morcar was Lord of the Manor, it was a prosperous settlement.\n\nThe Battle of Stamford Bridge was fought just 4 miles from Pocklington, and was the first of two major battles in that year for control of the country (the other being the Battle of Hastings. The former marked the end of Viking rule in England and the latter ushered in a period of Norman rule.\n\nAfter the Norman conquest the manor at Pocklington became a royal manor – with the Percy family as the King's overlords – and under this royal patronage, Pocklington continued to prosper. Pocklington was recorded in the Domesday Book as \"Poclinton\" and, given its current size, it is surprising to note that at the time of Domesday (1086) it is recorded as being the second largest settlement in Yorkshire after York itself, showing clearly that it had bounced back from its marginalisation in Roman Britain.\n\nPocklington developed through the Middle Ages while many similar places fell into dramatic decline. Pocklington owed much of its prosperity in the Middle Ages to the fact it was a local centre for the trading of wool and that it lay on the main road to York, an important national centre for the export of wool to the Continent. Wool was England’s principal export in the Middle Ages.\n\nA weekly market and regular fairs in the town were held by Royal Charter in 1245. Regular fairs continued until the early 1900s.\n\nThe town's All Saints' Church is the only survivor from the Middle Ages. Known as the \"Cathedral of the Wolds\", it dates from the late 12th to early 15th centuries. Although containing some fragments of the earlier Norman church, its foundations go back further to the original Saxon era. The clerestory is 13th century and the tower is 15th.\n\nParish records show that the Black Death (the bubonic plague) struck Pocklington hard in 1350, a year after its first outbreak in London and the south coast.\n\nPocklington School was founded in 1514 as the Guild of the Parish Church by senior churchmen and politician John Dolman. His family became Lords of the Manor in the 14th century.\n\nIn 1400 Pocklington was one of 30 East Riding of Yorkshire settlements which could be termed market towns. By 1750 there were just 10 and Pocklington was one. Over the next 150 years the town trebled in size with a host of new trades joining existing agricultural, brewing and milling interests.\n\nPocklington has one of the few Cromwellian charters in the country. The town charter was granted on 8 September 1656, one of the few during Oliver Cromwell's 11 years.\n\nPocklington also lays claim to being the last place in England to hold a witch burning. In 1630 the parish register for that year records Old Wife Green burnt in Market for being a witch.\n\nIn 1848 a cache of more than 500 coins from 1500 to 1700 was found on the edge of town.\n\nAnd 19 years later, the town's most notorious resident Isabella Bilington aged 32 was sentenced to death at York Assizes for crucifying her mother at Pocklington. After the killing she burnt a calf and a cock as a sacrifice. Her husband too was hanged as an accomplice.\n\nWilliam Wilberforce wrote his first public letter against the slave trade while at Pocklington School from 1771–76 and went on to be the driving force behind the abolition of slavery in the early 19th century. This is celebrated by the broken linked chain in the present town coat of arms.\n\nJohn Wesley, the founder of Methodism, was a frequent visitor to Pocklington in the late 18th century, and is among several notable churchmen, bishops and titular archbishops, born or educated in the town. A Wesleyan Methodist Church survives in use in Pocklington to this day.\n\nEntertainment also earned the town notoriety. The celebrated Flying Man of Pocklington, Thomas Pelling, attempted in 1733 to travel along a rope between the church and the Star Inn in the Market Square. He crashed to his death fracturing his skull against the wall of the church following a misunderstanding with men working the windlass. He is buried where he fell at the east end of the church where a plaque celebrates his memory.\n\nIn 1759 a Pocklington brewer called Timothy Overland received a piece of land on the York to Beverley road on the southern fringe of Pocklington and built the Pocklington New Inn. By 1778, the establishment was a prosperous Coach House at the height of the coaching era. The building is still in the same use today as the Pocklington Motel.\n\nBy this time the seat of the Lord of the Manor had transferred to Kilnwick Percy Hall. The present house was built in 1784 although there had been a hall there for many centuries. Unfortunately, a large section of it fell into disrepair and was pulled down during the 1940s. The remainder has (belatedly) been classed as a Grade II listed Georgian mansion.\n\nSteady further growth continued during the 19th century which saw much of the town completely rebuilt.\n\nIn 1814, an act of parliament was passed for making a navigable canal from East Cottingwith to Street Bridge (about a mile from Pocklington). An early draft of this Parliamentary act was recently discovered in the attic of a Pocklington house. By 1818 the Pocklington Canal linked Pocklington to the River Derwent. It fell into disuse with the decline of Britain's canals but has been continuously resurrected by the Pocklington Canal Amenity Society since 1971 and the old mill house is now classed as a Grade II listed water mill of historic interest: most of the mill mechanism still exists.\n\nIn 1821, the entire parish contained 2,163 inhabitants, of which 1,962 were of the township of Pocklington itself.\n\nIn 1868, Pocklington's inhabitants are described as being \"for the most part employed in agricultural pursuits, and in ropemaking, brickmaking, brewing, and malting. There are besides corn mills, iron foundries, and agricultural implement manufactories which materially contribute to the industrial wealth of the town.\"\n\nIn 1890, extensive repairs and alterations were made to All Saints' Church and, in a foreshadowing of modern interest in \"time capsules\", a message detailing the work was sealed in a glass bottle along with an 1890 newspaper and buried underneath the plith of the medieval Sotheby Cross. Unearthed accidentally during repairs in 2005, the sealed message and a copy of the 1890 newspaper were re-buried in the same spot, along with a contemporary copy of the Pocklington Post.\n\nThe group of five airfields based in and around Pocklington played an active role in the Second World War. Pocklington Airfield was completed in April 1941. The first operational unit to occupy Pocklington was the Canadian No. 405 Squadron with Wellington aircraft, but in 1942 the RAF's 102 (Ceylon) Squadron took over the airfield, flying night sorties to bomb targets in France. They still hold an annual reunion in Pocklington. It was disbanded on 20 October 1954.\n\nDuring the Second World War a few houses in Pocklington were subject to bombing, after their street was mistaken for the airfield.\n\nThose serving on HMS \"Volage\" also keep close ties with the town that adopted them during the war, sending letters and parcels. The association with Pocklington continues with a new housing estate being named 'Volage Court' in recognition of the links with HMS \"Volage\".\n\nPocklington used to be served by a railway connection but this was closed in the Beeching Report era of the 1960s. Some existing lengths of trackway can be seen behind the old railway station (now used as the sports hall for Pocklington School).

It was further expanded by Liang Siyong who suggested that the newly discovered Yangshao culture was established by the Xia in the west and the Longshan culture by the Yi peoples of the east. For Chinese and Western historians this hypothesis became the prevailing theory to interpret Chinese prehistory and remained so until about 1960.\n\nFurther archaeological discoveries made the theory obsolete. In 1950s it became clear that the Yinxu culture was preceded by the Erligang culture in Zhongyuan. In addition, the gap between the Erligang culture and the Longshan culture was joined by the Erlitou culture, which was named after the Erlitou site discovered in 1959. Chinese scholars identify the Erligang and Erlitou cultures as the sites of the Shang and Xia Dynasties respectively although the archaeological boundary between the two dynasties was still debatable. In 1983, the ruin of Yanshi Shang City was discovered and identified as the Erligang culture. The ruin very close to the Erlitou site suggests that the Erlitou and Erligang cultures were dominated by people with different cultural background.\n\nIn Shandong, the Shandong Longshan culture was replaced by the Yueshi culture around 2000 B.C. The sites of the Yueshi culture show complementary distribution with those of the Erligang culture which expanded eastward from Zhongyuan. It proved that the Shang people did not originated in the east.\n\nThough largely modified by further research, Fu Sinian's theory entered the history as a landmark in Chinese historiography. It essentially questioned ethnic homogeneity sometimes postulated as the route of Chinese civilization. This contributed to the concept of the dialogical development of cultures.\n\nSee for an English language summary of this theory:<br>\nChang Kwang-chih, 'China on the Eve of the Historical Period' in: Loewe, Michael and Edward L.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739120", "text": "Hoboken Four\n\nThe Hoboken Four was a musical quartet formed in 1935, uniting a trio of Italian-American musicians who called themselves the 3 Flashes with aspiring singer Frank Sinatra. The trio had been based in Hoboken, New Jersey, before meeting Sinatra in 1934, after which Sinatra drove them and their instruments to gigs outside the city and occasionally performed with them. Following their winning performance on the \"Major Bowes Amateur Hour\" on September 8, 1935, the newly-formed quartet embarked on a seven-month tour of the central and western United States and Canada with one of Major Bowes' touring companies. Tensions between the quartet members escalated, however, to the point that Sinatra was regularly beaten by the other members, and he quit the tour halfway through. He returned to Hoboken to pursue a solo career, while the rest of the group disbanded after the tour ended.\n\nThe original trio was composed of three Italian Americans who were childhood friends on Sixth Street in Hoboken, New Jersey: James (Jimmy Skelly) Petrozelli, Patrick (Patty Prince) Principe, and Fred (Freddie Tamby) Tamburro. They worked as truck drivers and sang and danced as a group. They had a regular weekend set at the Rustic Cabin, a roadhouse located on U.S. Route 9W near Alpine, New Jersey, about from Hoboken.\n\nIn 1934, the 19-year-old Frank Sinatra attached himself to the group, offering to drive them and their instruments to gigs outside Hoboken in his sports car. According to Tamburro: \"Frank hung around us like we were gods or something. We took him along for one simple reason: Frankie-boy had a car. He used to chauffeur us around\". Sinatra also acted as their unofficial manager, \"renting the four of them to schools and club bands, with himself as the featured singer for a small additional fee\". Sinatra had larger ambitions than being a manager or driver: he wanted to sing on stage, and performing with the 3 Flashes was the break he sought.\n\nIn September 1935 the 3 Flashes decided to audition for the \"Major Bowes Amateur Hour\", a radio show that encouraged listeners to vote for their favorite act either by calling the station or sending a postcard. The act that gained the most votes won the opportunity to go on a road tour with one of Major Bowes' touring companies. Sinatra also decided to audition as a solo singer. While the trio and the singer were accepted separately, Major Bowes felt it wouldn't do to promote two acts from the same town and put them together as a quartet which he renamed the Hoboken Four. According to another version of the story, it was Sinatra's mother, Dolly, who persuaded the trio to accept Sinatra as a permanent member.\n\nAppearing on the September 8, 1935 program, broadcast from the Capitol Theater in New York City, the quartet was introduced by Major Bowes as \"singing and dancing fools\". When asked to introduce themselves, each of the 3 Flashes cited their places of work, \"when they were not out of work\". When it was Sinatra's turn, Tamburro joked, \"This feller here has never worked at all\". Sinatra said, \"I'm Frank. We're looking for a job. How about it? Everyone that's ever heard us, likes us. We think we're pretty good\".\n\nThe group sang \"Shine\" by the Mills Brothers, and Sinatra performed \"Night and Day\" by Cole Porter. The group won the contest hands down; it was claimed that over 40,000 calls were received, the biggest response in the program's history. The following month, the group appeared in two short films produced by Major Bowes, \"The Nightclub\" and \"The Big Minstrel Act\". In the latter film, the singers wore blackface. The shorts aired at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nThe Hoboken Four returned to compete several times on the \"Major Bowes Amateur Hour\", calling themselves by different names each time, including the Seacaucus Cockamamies, the Bayonne Bacalas, the Jive Four, and the Jolly Jersey Gypsies of Song. They won each contest. During his live performance at the Sands in 1966, Sinatra said that Major Bowes had to change the name to fool other contenders and the audience from realizing it was the same winning group competing against a fresh pack of amateurs. Sinatra often joked about the dozens of names his group was given and how Major Bowes kept rigging the show for them to win.\n\nIn the winter of 1935–1936 the Hoboken Four embarked on a seven-month bus and train tour of vaudeville theaters in the central and western United States and Canada with one of Major Bowes' touring companies. Each member received $50 per week, plus meals, which was more money than any of them had ever earned before. They performed 35 shows per week in 39 states. Songs that were added to their repertoire included \"The Way You Look Tonight\" and \"A Fine Romance\".\n\nThe grind of constant traveling and lodging in substandard accommodations generated tension among the quartet members. At one stop, Sinatra either started giggling on stage or cracked a joke about Tamburro on stage, and Tamburro decked him after the show. Sinatra's talent and self-confidence were evident to everyone in the touring company, as well as his ability to attract female fans, and Tamburro and Petrozelli began taking out their frustrations by beating up Sinatra from time to time. Before the end of 1935, Sinatra had had enough. He quit the tour and returned home to Hoboken.\n\nThe original 3 Flashes continued with the tour as the Hoboken Trio, but soon decided to call it quits themselves. Petrozelli and Principe found jobs in Keansburg, New Jersey, while Tamburro went back to being a truck driver with an occasional singing gig.\n\n\n", "id": "7739120", "categories": ["Musical groups established in 1935", "Musical groups disestablished in 1936"], "title": "Hoboken Four"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739128", "text": "Islanding\n\nIslanding is the condition in which a distributed generator (DG) continues to power a location even though electrical grid power is no longer present. Islanding can be dangerous to utility workers, who may not realize that a circuit is still powered, and it may prevent automatic re-connection of devices. Additionally, without strict frequency control the balance between load and generation in the islanded circuit is going to be violated, leading to abnormal frequencies and voltages. For those reasons, distributed generators must detect islanding and immediately disconnect from the circuit; this is referred to as anti-islanding.\n\nA common example of islanding is a distribution feeder that has solar panels attached to it. In the case of a power outage, the solar panels will continue to deliver power as long as irradiance is sufficient. In this case, the circuit detached by the outage becomes an \"island\". For this reason, solar inverters that are designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have some sort of automatic anti-islanding circuitry.\n\nSome designs, commonly known as a microgrid, allow for intentional islanding. In case of an outage, a microgrid controller disconnects the local circuit from the grid on a dedicated switch and forces the distributed generator(s) to power the entire local load.\n\nIn the context of nuclear power plants, islanding is an exceptional mode of operation of a nuclear reactor. In this mode, the power plant is disconnected from the grid and cooling systems (especially the pumps) are powered using only the power generated by the reactor itself. For some reactor types, islanding is part of the normal procedure when the power plant disconnects from the grid, in order to quickly recover electricity production. When islanding fails, emergency systems (such as diesel generators) take over. For instance, French nuclear power plants are conducting islanding tests every 4 years. The Chernobyl disaster is a failed islanding test.\n\nElectrical inverters are devices that convert direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). Grid-interactive inverters have the additional requirement that they produce AC power that matches the existing power presented on the grid. In particular, a grid-interactive inverter must match the voltage, frequency and phase of the power line it connects to. There are numerous technical requirements to the accuracy of this tracking.\n\nConsider the case of a house with an array of solar panels on the roof. Inverter(s) attached to the panels convert the varying DC current provided by the panels into AC power that matches the grid supply. If the grid is disconnected, the voltage on the grid line might be expected to drop to zero, a clear indication of a service interruption. However, consider the case when the house's load exactly matches the output of the panels at the instant of the grid interruption. In this case the panels can continue supplying power, which is used up by the house's load. In this case there is no obvious indication that an interruption has occurred.\n\nNormally, even when the load and production are exactly matched, the so-called \"balanced condition\", the failure of the grid will result in several additional transient signals being generated. For instance, there will almost always be a brief decrease in line voltage, which will signal a potential fault condition. However, such events can also be caused by normal operation, like the starting of a large electric motor.\n\nMethods that detect islanding without a large number of false positives is the subject of considerable research. Each method has some threshold that needs to be crossed before a condition is considered to be a signal of grid interruption, which leads to a \"non-detection zone\" (NDZ), the range of conditions where a real grid failure will be filtered out. For this reason, before field deployment, grid-interactive inverters are typically tested by reproducing at their output terminals specific grid conditions and evaluating the effectiveness of the islanding methods in detecting islanding conditions. \n\nGiven the activity in the field, and the large variety of methods that have been developed to detect islanding, it is important to consider whether or not the problem actually demands the amount of effort being expended. Generally speaking, the reasons for anti-islanding are given as (in no particular order):\n\n\nThe first issue has been widely dismissed by many in the power industry. Line workers are already constantly exposed to unexpectedly live wires in the course of normal events (i.e. is a house blacked out because it has no power, or because they pulled the main breaker inside?). Normal operating procedures under hot-line rules or dead-line rules require line workers to test for power as a matter of course, and it has been calculated that active islands would add a negligible risk. However, other emergency workers may not have time to do a line check, and these issues have been extensively explored using risk-analysis tools. A UK-based study concluded that \"The risk of electric shock associated with islanding of PV systems under worst-case PV penetration scenarios to both network operators and customers is typically <10 per year.\"\n\nThe second possibility is also considered extremely remote. In addition to thresholds that are designed to operate \"quickly\", islanding detection systems also have absolute thresholds that will trip long before conditions are reached that could cause end-user equipment damage. It is, generally, the last two issues that cause the most concern among utilities. Reclosers are commonly used to divide up the grid into smaller sections that will automatically, and quickly, re-energize the branch as soon as the fault condition (a tree branch on lines for instance) clears. There is some concern that the reclosers may not re-energize in the case of an island, or that the rapid cycling they cause might interfere with the ability of the DG system to match the grid again after the fault clears.\n\nIf an islanding issue does exist, it appears to be limited to certain types of generators. A 2004 Canadian report concluded that synchronous generators, installations like microhydro, were the main concern. These systems may have considerable mechanical inertia that will provide a useful signal. For inverter based systems, the report largely dismissed the problem; \"Anti-islanding technology for inverter based DG systems is much better developed, and published risk assessments suggest that the current technology and standards provide adequate protection while penetration of DG into the distribution system remains relatively low.\" The report also noted that \"views on the importance \nof this issue tend to be very polarized,\" with utilities generally considering the possibility of occurrence and its impacts, while those supporting DG systems generally use a risk based approach and the very low probabilities of an island forming.\n\nAn example of such an approach, one that strengthens the case that islanding is largely a non-issue, is a major real-world islanding experiment that was carried out in the Netherlands in 1999. Although based on then-current anti-islanding system, typically the most basic voltage jump detection methods, the testing clearly demonstrated that islands could not last longer than 60 seconds. Moreover, the theoretical predictions were true; the chance of a balance condition existing were on the order of 10 a year, and that the chance that the grid would disconnect at that point in time was even less. As an island can only form when both conditions are true, they concluded that the \"Probability of encountering an islanding is virtually zero\"\n\nNevertheless, utility companies have continued to use islanding as a reason to delay or refuse the implementation of distributed generation systems. In Ontario, Hydro One recently introduced interconnection guidelines that refused connection if the total distributed generation capacity on a branch was 7% of the maximum yearly peak power. At the same time, California sets a limit of 15% only for review, allowing connections up to 30%, and is actively considering moving the review-only limit to 50%.\n\nThe issue can be hotly political. In Ontario a number of potential customers taking advantage of a new Feed-in tariff program were refused connection only after building their systems. This was a problem particularly in rural areas where numerous farmers were able to set up small (10 kWp) systems under the \"capacity exempt\" microFIT program only to find that Hydro One had implemented a new capacity regulation after the fact, in many cases after the systems had been installed.\n\nDetecting an islanding condition is the subject of considerable research. In general, these can be classified into passive methods, which look for transient events on the grid, and active methods, which probe the grid by sending signals of some sort from the inverter or the grid distribution point. There are also methods that the utility can use to detect the conditions that would cause the inverter-based methods to fail, and deliberately upset those conditions in order to make the inverters switch off. A Sandia Labs Report covers many of these methodologies, both in-use and future developments. These methods are summarized below.\n\nPassive methods include any system that attempts to detect transient changes on the grid, and use that information as the basis as a probabilistic determination of whether or not the grid has failed, or some other condition has resulted in a temporary change.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law, the voltage in an electrical circuit is a function of electric current (the supply of electrons) and the applied load (resistance). In the case of a grid interruption, the current being supplied by the local source is unlikely to match the load so perfectly as to be able to maintain a constant voltage. A system that periodically samples voltage and looks for sudden changes can be used to detect a fault condition.\n\nUnder/over voltage detection is normally trivial to implement in grid-interactive inverters, because the basic function of the inverter is to match the grid conditions, including voltage. That means that all grid-interactive inverters, by necessity, have the circuitry needed to \"detect\" the changes. All that is needed is an algorithm to detect sudden changes. However, sudden changes in voltage are a common occurrence on the grid as loads are attached and removed, so a threshold must be used to avoid false disconnections.\n\nThe range of conditions that result in non-detection with this method may be large, and these systems are generally used along with other detection systems.\n\nThe frequency of the power being delivered to the grid is a function of the supply, one that the inverters carefully match. When the grid source is lost, the frequency of the power would fall to the natural resonant frequency of the circuits in the island. Looking for changes in this frequency, like voltage, is easy to implement using already required functionality, and for this reason almost all inverters also look for fault conditions using this method as well.\n\nUnlike changes in voltage, it is generally considered highly unlikely that a random circuit would naturally have a natural frequency the same as the grid power. However, many devices deliberately synchronize to the grid frequency, like televisions. Motors, in particular, may be able to provide a signal that is within the NDZ for some time as they \"wind down\". The combination of voltage and frequency shifts still results in a NDZ that is not considered adequate by all.\n\nIn order to decrease the time in which an island is detected, rate of change of frequency has been adopted as a detection method. The rate of change of frequency is given by the following expression:\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere formula_2 is the system frequency, formula_3 is the time, formula_4 is the power imbalance (formula_5), formula_6 is the system capacity, and formula_7 is the system inertia.\n\nShould the rate of change of frequency, or ROCOF value, be greater than a certain value, the embedded generation will be disconnected from the network.\n\nLoads generally have power factors that are not perfect, meaning that they do not accept the voltage from the grid perfectly, but impede it slightly. Grid-tie inverters, by definition, have power factors of 1. This can lead to changes in phase when the grid fails, which can be used to detect islanding.\n\nInverters generally track the phase of the grid signal using a phase locked loop (PLL) of some sort. The PLL stays in sync with the grid signal by tracking when the signal crosses zero volts. Between those events, the system is essentially \"drawing\" a sine-shaped output, varying the current output to the circuit to produce the proper voltage waveform. When the grid disconnects, the power factor suddenly changes from the grid's (1) to the load's (~1). As the circuit is still providing a current that would produce a smooth voltage output given the known loads, this condition will result in a sudden change in voltage. By the time the waveform is completed and returns to zero, the signal will be out of phase.\n\nThe main advantage to this approach is that the shift in phase will occur even if the load exactly matches the supply in terms of Ohm's law - the NDZ is based on power factors of the island, which are very rarely 1. The downside is that many common events, like motors starting, also cause phase jumps as new impedances are added to the circuit. This forces the system to use relatively large thresholds, reducing its effectiveness.\n\nEven with noisy sources, like motors, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of a grid-connected circuit is generally unmeasurable due to the essentially infinite capacity of the grid that filters these events out. Inverters, on the other hand, generally have much larger distortions, as much as 5% THD. This is a function of their construction; some THD is a natural side-effect of the switched-mode power supply circuits most inverters are based on.\n\nThus, when the grid disconnects, the THD of the local circuit will naturally increase to that of the inverters themselves. This provides a very secure method of detecting islanding, because there are generally no other sources of THD that would match that of the inverter. Additionally, interactions within the inverters themselves, notably the transformers, have non-linear effects that produce unique 2nd and 3rd harmonics that are easily measurable.\n\nThe drawback of this approach is that some loads may filter out the distortion, in the same way that the inverter attempts to. If this filtering effect is strong enough, it may reduce the THD below the threshold needed to trigger detection. Systems without a transformer on the \"inside\" of the disconnect point will make detection more difficult. However, the largest problem is that modern inverters attempt to lower the THD as much as possible, in some cases to unmeasurable limits.\n\nActive methods generally attempt to detect a grid failure by injecting small signals into the line, and then detecting whether or not the signal changes.\n\nThis method is an active islanding detection method which can be used by three-phase electronically coupled distributed generation (DG) units. The method is based on injecting a negative-sequence current through the voltage-sourced converter (VSC) controller and detecting and quantifying the corresponding negative-sequence voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) of the VSC by means of a unified three-phase signal processor (UTSP). The UTSP system is an enhanced phase-locked loop (PLL) which provides a high degree of immunity to noise, and thus enables islanding detection based on injecting a small negative-sequence current. The negative-sequence current is injected by a negative-sequence controller which is adopted as the complementary of the conventional VSC current controller. The negative-sequence current injection method detects an islanding event within 60 ms (3.5 cycles) under UL1741 test conditions, requires 2% to 3% negative-sequence current injection for islanding detection, can correctly detect an islanding event for the grid short circuit ratio of 2 or higher, and is insensitive to variations of the load parameters of UL1741 test system. \nImpedance Measurement attempts to measure the overall impedance of the circuit being fed by the inverter. It does this by slightly \"forcing\" the current amplitude through the AC cycle, presenting too much current at a given time. Normally this would have no effect on the measured voltage, as the grid is an effectively infinitely stiff voltage source. In the event of a disconnection, even the small forcing would result in a noticeable change in voltage, allowing detection of the island.\n\nThe main advantage of this method is that it has a vanishingly small NDZ for any given single inverter. However, the inverse is also the main weakness of this method; in the case of multiple inverters, each one would be forcing a slightly different signal into the line, hiding the effects on any one inverter. It is possible to address this problem by communication between the inverters to ensure they all force on the same schedule, but in a non-homogeneous install (multiple installations on a single branch) this becomes difficult or impossible in practice. Additionally, the method only works if the grid is effectively infinite, and in practice many real-world grid connections do not sufficiently meet this criterion.\n\nAlthough the methodology is similar to Impedance Measurement, this method, also known as \"harmonic amplitude jump\", is actually closer to Harmonics Detection. In this case, the inverter deliberately introduces harmonics at a given frequency, and as in the case of Impedance Measurement, expects the signal from the grid to overwhelm it until the grid fails. Like Harmonics Detection, the signal may be filtered out by real-world circuits.\n\nThis is one of the newest methods of islanding detection, and in theory, one of the best. It is based on forcing the phase of the inverter's output to be slightly mis-aligned with the grid, with the expectation that the grid will overwhelm this signal. The system relies on the actions of a finely tuned phase-locked loop to become unstable when the grid signal is missing; in this case, the PLL attempts to adjust the signal back to itself, which is tuned to continue to drift. In the case of grid failure, the system will quickly drift away from the design frequency, eventually causing the inverter to shut down.\n\nThe major advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented using circuitry that is already present in the inverter. The main disadvantage is that it requires the inverter to always be slightly out of time with the grid, a lowered power factor. Generally speaking, the system has a vanishingly small NDZ and will quickly disconnect, but it is known that there are some loads that will react to offset the detection.\n\nFrequency bias forces a slightly off-frequency signal into the grid, but \"fixes\" this at the end of every cycle by jumping back into phase when the voltage passes zero. This creates a signal similar to Slip Mode, but the power factor remains closer to that of the grid's, and resets itself every cycle. Moreover, the signal is less likely to be filtered out by known loads. The main disadvantage is that every inverter would have to agree to shift the signal back to zero at the same point on the cycle, say as the voltage crosses back to zero, otherwise different inverters will force the signal in different directions and filter it out.\n\nThere are numerous possible variations to this basic scheme. The Frequency Jump version, also known as the \"zebra method\", inserts forcing only on a specific number of cycles in a set pattern. This dramatically reduces the chance that external circuits may filter the signal out. This advantage disappears with multiple inverters, unless some way of synchronizing the patterns is used.\n\nThe utility also has a variety of methods available to it to force systems offline in the event of a failure.\n\nMost small generator connections require a mechanical disconnect switch, so at a minimum the utility could send a repairman to pull them all. For very large sources, one might simply install a dedicated telephone hotline that can be used to have an operator manually shut down the generator. In either case, the reaction time is likely to be on the order of minutes, or hours.\n\nManual disconnection could be automated through the use of signals sent though the grid, or on secondary means. For instance, power line carrier communications could be installed in all inverters, periodically checking for signals from the utility and disconnecting either on command, or if the signal disappears for a fixed time. Such a system would be highly reliable, but expensive to implement.\n\nAs the utility can be reasonably assured that they will always have a method for discovering a fault, whether that be automated or simply looking at the recloser, it is possible for the utility to use this information and transmit it down the line. This can be used to force the tripping of properly equipped DG systems by deliberately opening a series of recloser in the grid to force the DG system to be isolated in a way that forces it out of the NDZ. This method can be guaranteed to work, but requires the grid to be equipped with automated recloser systems, and external communications systems that guarantee the signal will make it through to the reclosers.\n\nA related concept is to deliberately force a section of the grid into a condition that will guarantee the DG systems will disconnect. This is similar to the transfer-trip method, but uses active systems at the head-end of the utility, as opposed to relying on the topology of the network.\n\nA simple example is a large bank of capacitors that are added to a branch, left charged up and normally disconnected by a switch. In the event of a failure, the capacitors are switched into the branch by the utility after a short delay. This can be easily accomplished through automatic means at the point of distribution. The capacitors can only supply current for a brief period, ensuring that the start or end of the pulse they deliver will cause enough of a change to trip the inverters.\n\nThere appears to be no NDZ for this method of anti-islanding. Its main disadvantage is cost; the capacitor bank has to be large enough to cause changes in voltage that will be detected, and this is a function of the amount of load on the branch. In theory, very large banks would be needed, an expense the utility is unlikely to look on favourably.\n\nAnti-islanding protection can be improved through the use of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems already widely used in the utility market. For instance, an alarm could sound if the SCADA system detects voltage on a line where a failure is known to be in progress. This does not affect the anti-islanding systems, but may allow any of the systems noted above to be quickly implemented.\n\nDistributed Resource Unit, IEEE Trans. on Power Electronics, VOL. 23, NO. 1, JANUARY 2008.\n\n", "id": "7739128", "categories": ["Electric power distribution"], "title": "Islanding"}

The Chapel of Our Lady of Perpetual Help (Dutch: Onze-Lieve-Vrouw van Bijstand) at the Herentalsebaan, was built by Leonard Pierre Joseph du Bus de Gisignies in 1837. In 1930 a Lourdes cave was added to the chapel (inaugurated on 7 May 1933), and in 1934 a Stations of the Cross was added in remembrance of King Albert I of Belgium (sculptor was Simon Goossens). The \"Chapel of Saint Anthony\" (Dutch: Sint-Antoniuskapel) in the hamlet Salphen dates from 1626.\n\nOostmalle Airfield is located south on the territory of Oostmalle, close to the hamlet of Salphen, and the forest of Blommerschot. This airfield is currently used for recreational purposes (Gliding). There was some talk of using this airfield as an alternative for the Airport in Deurne should it have to close.\n\nEach year the international Sluitingsprijs Oostmalle is organised in Oostmalle, which is part of the Cyclo-cross Gazet van Antwerpen. It marks the end of the Cyclo-cross season.\n\nOn Sunday 25 June 1967 at 4:17 pm Oostmalle was hit by a tornado which destroyed the church and the centre of the village. Of the church, only the tower was rebuilt in its original state.

In 1933 he founded the world's first museum for dance in Paris.\n\nRolf de Maré was born in Stockholm in 1888 as the son of diplomat Henrik de Maré and sculptor Ellen Roosval von Hallwyl. In 1913 he made friends with post-impressionist painter Nils von Dardel who was not particularly well off, but imaginative and talented, while de Maré was enthusiastic and had money. \n\nIn 1918, through Dardel, de Maré met Jean Börlin and de Maré became lover and protector of the Swedish dancer.\n\nTogether with Dardel he created in 1920 the Ballets Suédois at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris of which Börlin was first dancer and choreographer. In the autumn of 1924 Giorgio de Chirico curated the scenography and costumes for Pirandello's La Giara.\n\nBörlin died in 1930 and in 1933, de Maré founded Les Archives internationales de la Danse (AID) in Paris in his memory, the world's first museum and research institute for dance. The Archive became a famous centre for studies in dance and visitors came from all over the world to see exhibitions or to study in its vast library. The dance center also published its own magazine and books, arranged lecture demonstrations in the building which de Maré had constructed for his dance centre.\n\nAfter the World War the archives had grown too large for a private person to maintain, de Maré closed his business in Paris and donated parts of the collections — some 6,000 books, engravings and other items, all concerned mainly with Western dance — to the French government which placed them at the museum and library of the Paris Opera. However, the museum declined to accept two substantial elements of de Maré's collection: firstly, material from the Ballets Suédois, and secondly, the fruits of his expedition of exploration to Indonesia in 1936 — the first to have been undertaken with the purpose of documenting dance.\n\nTherefore, the collection from the Swedish Ballet in Paris and the non-European collections were brought by de Maré to Stockholm to form the Dance Museum, which he opened in 1953 in the basement of the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. On his death he made the Dance Museum the sole heir to his fortune, and this enabled the museum to make further acquisitions.\n\nAfter dissolving the Ballets Suedois in 1925, de Maré made no attempt to revive its works. The various, concrete collectibles de Maré amassed and that exist today as the bedrock of Stockholm's Dance Museum, illuminate our picture of him as archivist and art collector, all the while they question his role as a \"connoisseur\" of a theater based on the art of dancing. Throughout his life, Rolf de Maré was also a distinguished art collector. In the early 1960s, he made an important donation of modernist art to the Moderna Museet. Rolf de Maré died of a stroke in Barcelona in 1964.\n\n", "id": "7739158", "categories": ["1888 births", "Ballet impresarios", "People from Stockholm", "Swedish art collectors"], "title": "Rolf de Maré"}

He is unhappily married to Louise, played by Elizabeth Allan. While she is away, he begins a love affair with Helen, played by Maria Schell. However, Scobie's Catholic faith leaves him tormented with guilt. The film also features Denholm Elliott, Peter Finch, Gérard Oury, George Coulouris and Michael Hordern.\n\nIt contains no original score, but instead features indigenous music from Sierra Leone in West Africa, where location filming took place. The interiors were filmed at Shepperton Studios in London. The black and white cinematography was by Jack Hildyard.\n\nScobie, Deputy Commissioner of the Sierra Leone Police in Freetown during the Second World War, is unhappily married to fellow-Catholic Louise and both mourn their only daughter. Despite his having been a police officer in the country for 15 years when the Police Commissioner announces he is to retire Scobie is not chosen to replace him, but rather a younger man is being sent out from England.\n\nOn a search of a visiting Portuguese ship, the neutral vessel \"Esperança\", he finds an envelope addressed to Germany. When he confiscates it, the captain begs him to do nothing because the letter is to his daughter. Feeling pity, Scobie burns it. His wife keeps begging him to let her go to South Africa but they cannot afford the fare. Eventually he accepts a loan from Yusef, a suspected smuggler, to send her away by sea.\n\nCalled up country because a local District Commissioner is in trouble, he finds the man has committed suicide because of his debts to smugglers. While he is there, survivors of a ship torpedoed by the Germans are brought ashore by the Vichy police of neighbouring French Guinea. One he notices is Helen, a very young widow who reminds him of his dead daughter. Back in Freetown he finds she has been given a hut near his house and after he pays her a visit the two start an affair. When he learns that Louise is coming back on the next voyage of the \"Esperança\", he writes Helen a note. It never reaches her, because it is intercepted by a servant in Yusef's pay.\n\nYusef then tells Scobie that he must give a packet of contraband diamonds to the captain of the Esperança or face ruin. Complying, he returns home and at a party to welcome Helen to the district he learns that Louise will shortly return home, and that they will be unable to continue their affair. Louise then forces Scobie to attend mass and take communion, which damns him because he had not confessed his sins of adultery and corruption. Unable to keep the woman he loves and liable to lose his job at any moment, he prepares to commit suicide but instead is distracted by a violent altercation between some criminals and is fatally injured in the skirmish, dying in his servant’s arms.\n\nThe main difference between the film and the book is in the ending, which is almost equally bleak, but reversed from Greene's original story.

Brown served as Council Member of the American Political Science Association (2007–09) and as Chair of the UC Humanities Research Institute Board of Governors (2009–11). In 2012, her book \"Walled States, Waning Sovereignty\" won the David Eastman Award. Brown received the 2016 Distinguished Teaching Award, UC Berkeley's most prestigious honor for teaching. She received a UC Presidents Humanities Research Fellowship (2017–18) and was a Guggenheim Fellow (2017–18).\n\nBrown's thinking on the decline of sovereignty and the hollowing out of democracy has found popular and journalistic audiences, with discussions of her work appearing in \"The New York Times,\" \"The Washington Post,\" and \"The Guardian\". Brown has appeared in documentary films including \"The Value of the Humanities\" (2014) and \"What is Democracy?\" (directed by Astra Taylor, 2018).\n\nTogether with Michel Feher, Brown is co-editor of the Zone Books' series Near Futures and its digital supplement Near Futures Online.\n\nBrown has established new paradigms in critical legal studies and feminist theory. She has produced a body of work drawing from Karl Marx's critique of capitalism and its relation to religion and secularism, Friedrich Nietzsche's usefulness for thinking about power and the ruses of morality, Max Weber on the modern organization of power, psychoanalysis and its implications for political identification, Michel Foucault's work on governmentality and neoliberalism, as well as other contemporary continental philosophers. Bringing these resources together with her own thinking on a range of topics, Brown's work aims to diagnose modern and contemporary formations of political power, and to discern the threats to democracy entailed by such formations.\n\nIn this work Brown asks how a sense of woundedness can become the basis for individual and collective forms of identity. From outlawing hate speech to banning pornography, Brown argues, well-intentioned attempts at protection can legitimize the state while harming subjects by codifying their identities as helpless or in need of continuous governmental regulation. While breaking ground in political theory, this work also represents one of Brown's key interventions in feminist and queer theory. The book offers a novel account of legal and political power as constitutive of norms of sexuality and gender. Through the concept of \"wounded attachments\", Brown contends that psychic injury may accompany and sustain racial, ethnic, and gender categories, particularly in relation to state law and discursive formations. In this and other works Brown has criticized representatives of second wave feminism, such as Catharine MacKinnon, for reinscribing the category of \"woman\" as an essentialized identity premised on injury.\n\nThis book comprises a series of essays on contemporary political issues from the problem of moralism in politics to the legacies of past injustices in the present. Throughout her thematically overlapping chapters, Brown asks: \"What happens to left and liberal political orientations when faith in progress is broken, when both the sovereign individual and sovereign states seem tenuous, when desire seems as likely to seek punishment as freedom, when all political conviction is revealed as contingent and subjective?\" Much of this book takes history and liberalism themselves as objects of theoretical reflection and sites of contestation. Drawing on a range of thinkers, such as Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Spinoza, Benjamin and Derrida, Brown rethinks the disorientation and possibility inherent to contemporary democracy.\n\nThis work consists of seven articles responding to particular occasions, each of which \"mimic, in certain ways, the experience of the political realm: one is challenged to think here, now, about a problem that is set and framed by someone else, and to do so before a particular audience or in dialogue with others not of one's own choosing.\" Each individual essay begins with a specific problem: what is the relationship between love, loyalty, and dissent in contemporary American political life?; how did neoliberal rationality become a form of governmentality?; what are the main problems of women's studies programs?; and so on. According to Brown, the essays do not aim to definitively answer the given questions but \"to critically interrogate the framing and naming practices, challenge the dogmas (including those of the Left and of feminism), and discern the constitutive powers shaping the problem at hand.\"\n\nIn this book, Brown subverts the usual and widely accepted notion that tolerance is one of the most remarkable achievements of Western modernity. She suggests that tolerance (or toleration) cannot be perceived as the complete opposite to violence. At times, it can also be used to justify violence. Brown argues that tolerance primarily operates as a discourse of subject construction and a mode of governmentality that addresses or confirms asymmetric relations between different groups, each of which must then \"tolerate\" other groups and categories or \"be tolerated\" by the dominant groups and categories.\n\nTo substantiate her thesis, Brown examines the tolerance discourse of figures like George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Samuel Huntington, Susan Okin, Michael Ignatieff, Bernard Lewis, and Seyla Benhabib and argues that \"tolerance as a political practice is always conferred by the dominant, it is always a certain expression of domination even as it offers protection or incorporation to the less powerful.\" Among those influenced by Brown's thinking on this subject are Joan Wallach Scott and Slavoj Žižek, whose respective works \"The Politics of the Veil\" (2007) and \"Violence: Six Sideways Reflections\" (2007) draw heavily on Brown's account of tolerance discourse.\n\nIn a debate with Rainer Forst at the ICI in Berlin Brown addressed this problematic again, later published as a co-authored book, The Power of Tolerance (2014). Here Brown argues against primarily moral or normative approaches to power and discourse, and warns against the dangers of uncritically celebrating the liberal ideal of tolerance, as frequently happens in Western notions of historical, civilizational or moral progress.\n\nPublished exclusively in French, \"Les habits neufs de la politique mondiale\" (\"The New Clothes of World Politics\") argues that the following political fact is irreversible: liberal democracy, as a global social and historical modality of statecraft, is dying. The two movements delivering such blows, neoliberalism and neoconservatism, feature both resonances and disonances. Brown argues that whilst the former acts as a political rationality, a mode of general regulation of behavior, the latter is both necessary to its survival, and parasitic of its survival. As a form of governmentality that redefines freedom, neoliberalism will moralize politics, limiting its scope; this is the function of neo-conservatism.\n\nThis book examines the revival of wall-building under shifting conditions of global capitalism. Brown not only problematizes the assumed functions of walls, such as the prevention of crime, migration, smuggling, and so on. She also argues that walling has taken on new a significance due to its symbolic function in an increasingly globalized and precarious world of financial capital. As individual identity as well as nation-state sovereignty are threatened, walls become objects invested with individual and collective desire. Anxious efforts to shore up national identity are thus projected onto borders as well as new material structures that would appear to secure them. The book was reprinted with a new preface by the author following the 2016 election of Donald Trump.\n\nBrown's study begins by engaging and revising key arguments in Foucault's \"The Birth of Biopolitics\" with the aim of analyzing different ways that democracy is being hollowed out by neoliberal rationality. She describes neoliberalism as a thoroughgoing attack on the most foundational ideas and practices of democracy. The individual chapters of the book examine the effects of neoliberalization on higher education, law, governance, the basic principles of liberal democratic institutions, as well as radical democratic imaginaries.\n\nBrown treats \"neoliberalism as a governing rationality through which everything is 'economized' and in a very specific way: human beings become market actors and nothing but, every field of activity is seen as a market, and every entity (whether public or private, whether person, business, or state) is governed as a firm.\" To address such threats, Brown argues, democracy must be reinvigorated not only as an object of theoretical inquiry but also as a site of political struggle.\n\nBrown's latest book is forthcoming with Columbia University Press in 2019.\n\nA prominent public intellectual in the United States, Brown has written and spoken about issues of free speech, public education, political protest, LGBTQ issues, sexual assault, Donald Trump, conservatism, neoliberalism, and other matters of national and international concern.\n\nFor decades, Brown has been active in efforts to resist measures toward the privatization of the University of California system. In her capacity as co-chair of the Berkeley Faculty Association, she raised awareness, organized marches, and spoke publicly about the privatization of public education. She has been critical of the university's decision to cut costs by utilizing lecturers rather than hiring tenure and tenure track professors. Relatedly, she has voiced concern over the perils of the UC's proposed online education programs.\n\nBrown has criticized university administration for their response to sexual assault. \"I think many faculty feel there are repeat harassers on our faculty who are never charged ... Graduate students gave up on careers, and these perpetrators were allowed to continue, and that was wrong—never should have happened,\" she said.\n\nAt the \"99 Mile March\" to Sacramento she addressed her criticism to more general trends: \"We are marching to draw attention to the plight of public education in California and to implore Californians to re-invest in it. For all its resources, innovation and wealth, California has sunk to nearly the bottom of the nation in per student spending, and our public higher education system, once the envy of the world, is in real peril.\" Brown supported Occupy Wall Street as part of the UC faculty council, claiming that \"We understand this to be part of what (the movement) stands for. We are delighted by the protests and consider our campaign to be at one with it.\"\n\nBrown is a native of California and lives in Berkeley with her partner Judith Butler and son.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7739276", "categories": ["Critical theorists", "University of California, Santa Cruz alumni", "21st-century philosophers", "1955 births", "LGBT scientists from the United States", "Postmodern feminists", "American feminists", "Living people", "20th-century American philosophers", "Feminist theorists", "Princeton University alumni", "Williams College faculty", "American political philosophers", "European Graduate School faculty", "LGBT feminists", "Psychoanalytic theory", "LGBT writers from the United States", "American political scientists", "University of California, Berkeley faculty", "Cultural critics", "Philosophers of culture", "University of California, Santa Cruz faculty", "American political theorists", "Philosophers from California"], "title": "Wendy Brown (political theorist)"}

He works in the Department of English at Liverpool John Moores University., where he is Professor of Irish Cultural History. His early publications were mainly in the field of Irish literature, although since 2002 he has also written widely on the subject of Irish music. Smyth was an early advocate of postcolonial criticism in Irish Studies, although more recently he has been keen to emphasise the autobiographical dimension of critical discourse. \"Decolonisation and Criticism\" won the American Conference for Irish Studies' Michael J. Durkan Prize for best book published in literary criticism, arts criticism or cultural studies in 1999. \"Beautiful Day: Forty Years of Irish Rock\" (co-authored with Sean Campbell) was launched in the Clarence Hotel in Dublin in September 2005. \"Our House: The Representation of Domestic Space in Contemporary Culture\" (co-edited with Jo Croft) was launched at the Tate Liverpool in September 2006. His collection of critical essays \"Music in Irish Cultural History\" also won the Michael J. Durkan Prize (2009). Smyth has lectured throughout Europe and the United States on various aspects of Irish culture; most recently he was a keynote speaker at IASIL 2017, held in Singapore. In September / October 2006 he was Academic-in-Residence at the Princess Grace Irish Library in Monaco. He was appointed Visiting Professor of Irish Studies at the University of Vienna between October 2010 and February 2011.\nSmyth's latest book is \"Celtic Tiger Blues: Music and Modern Irish Identity\" (Routledge, 2016), and includes analyses of work by James Joyce, the Pogues, Bernard MacLaverty, The Waterboys, Tim Robinson, and Augusta Holmes.\n\nSmyth is a founder member of the Liverpool-Irish Literary Theatre, specialising in the writing and production of plays on Irish literary themes. In 2011 Smyth wrote a two-man show entitled \"The Brother\" which he adapted from the work of Flann O'Brien. He performed the play (with actor David Llewellyn, directed by Andrew Sherlock) at an international Flann O'Brien conference in Vienna in July 2011, and at another international conference in Trieste in May 2012. \"The Brother\" had a six-night run at the Edinburgh Free Fringe Festival in August 2012, and has subsequently been performed at the Eleanor Rathbone Theatre (the University of Liverpool), as part of the 2012 May Festival at the University of Aberdeen, and at the IASIL (International Association for the Study of Irish Literature) Conference in Lille in June 2014. Smyth wrote a companion piece entitled \"Will the Real Flann O'Brien ...? A Life in Five Scenes\" which he performed (in a double header with \"The Brother\") at the 2013 Liverpool Irish Festival, and at the Third Flann O'Brien Conference in Prague in July 2015. The Liverpool Irish Literary Theatre travelled to the O'Brien conference Salzburg in July 2017 to perform a trio of short plays, including two by Flann O'Brien - \"Thirst\" and \"The Dead Spit of Kelly\" - as well as \"The Golden Gate\" by Lord Dunsany.\n\nIn August 2017 Smyth's play \"Nora & Jim\" - based on an episode in the lives of James Joyce and Nora Barnacle - ran for six nights at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.\n\nIn October 2018 Smyth’s cabaret adaptation of the album ‘’Murder Ballads’’ by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds premiered at the Liverpool Royal Court. The show played to excellent reviews over three nights; it is currently in development for further performances throughout 2019.\n\n\nUnder the name Gerry McGowan, Smyth has also released four albums of progressive folk music: \"The Colour Tree\" (2003), \"riverrun\" (2005), and \"The Usual Story\" (2008). He has also recorded and released two albums of Liverpool-related shanties: \"Roll & Go: Songs of Liverpool and the Sea\" (2009), and \"Across the Western Ocean\" (2011); the latter is a compilation of songs by various musicians from Merseyside performing shanties and ballads associated with Liverpool in aid of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute station in Hoylake, Merseyside.\n\nIn 2012 Smyth recorded and released an album entitled \"James Joyce's Chamber Music\": this was a folk musical version (co-written and performed with his daughter) of the thirty-six lyric suite published by James Joyce in 1907. The album was launched at a concert in the Bluecoat Arts Centre in Liverpool in October 2012 as part of the Liverpool Irish Festival. In 2013 and 2014 Smyth performed concerts of selected material from this album at concerts in Nijmegen, Brussels, Kortrijk, Paris, Rennes, Reykjavik, Trieste, Kristiansand, Gothenburg, Sassari, and Florence.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739305", "text": "Models of abnormality\n\nModels of abnormality are general hypotheses as to the nature of psychological abnormalities. The four main models to explain psychological abnormality are the biological, behavioural, cognitive, and psychodynamic models. They all attempt to explain the causes and treatments for all psychological illnesses, and all from a different approach.\n\nThe biological model of abnormality (the only model not based on psychological principles) is based on the assumptions that if the brain, neuroanatomy and related biochemicals are all physical entities and work together to mediate psychological processes, then treating any mental abnormality must be physical/biological. Part of this theory stems from much research into the major neurotransmitter, serotonin, which seems to show that major psychological illnesses such as bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa are caused by abnormally reduced levels of Serotonin in the brain.(1) The model also suggests that psychological illness could and should be treated like any physical illness (being caused by chemical imbalance, microbes or physical stress) and hence can be treated with surgery or drugs. Electroconvulsive therapy has also proved to be a successful short-term treatment for depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder and related illnesses, although the reasons for its success are almost completely unknown. There is also evidence for a genetic factor in causing psychological illness.(2)(3). The main cures for psychological illness under this model: electroconvulsive therapy, drugs and surgery at times can have very good results in restoring \"normality\" as biology has been shown to play some sort of role in psychological illness. However they can also have consequences, whether biology is responsible or not, as drugs always have a chance of causing allergic reactions or addiction. Electrotherapy can cause unnecessary stress and surgery can dull the personality, as the part of the brain responsible for emotion (hypothalamus) is often altered or even completely removed.\n\nA diagnosis of mental 'illness' implies that a person is in no way responsible for the abnormality of functioning and as such is not to blame. The concept of 'no blame' is generally thought to be more humane and likely to elicit a much more sympathetic response from others.\n\nHowever Zarate (1972), pointed out that even more than physical illness, mental illness is something that people fear – largely because it is something they do not understand. In general, people do not know how to respond to someone diagnosed as mentally ill. There may also be fears that the person's behaviour might be unpredictable or potentially dangerous. Therefore, sympathy is more likely to give way to avoidance of the person, which in turn leads to the person feeling shunned.\nA huge amount of research has been carried out within the framework of the medical model and this has greatly increased our understanding of the possible biological factors underpinning psychological disorders. However, much of the evidence is inconclusive and findings can be difficult to interpret. For example, in family studies, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of genetics from the effects of environment. It can also be difficult to establish cause and effect. For example, raised levels of dopamine may be a consequence rather than a cause of schizophrenia.\n\nMany psychologists criticise psychiatry for focusing its attention primarily on symptoms and for assuming that relieving symptoms with drugs cures the problem. Unfortunately, in many cases when the drug treatment is ceased the symptoms recur. This suggests that drugs are not addressing the true cause of the problem.\n\nThe behavioural model to abnormality assumes that all maladaptive behaviour is essentially acquired through one's environment. Therefore, psychiatrists practising the beliefs of this model would be to prioritise changing the behaviour over identifying the cause of the dysfunctional behaviour. The main solution to psychological illness under this model is aversion therapy, where the stimulus that provokes the dysfunctional behaviour is coupled with a second stimulus, with aims to produce a new reaction to the first stimulus based on the experiences of the second. Also, systematic desensitisation can be used, especially where phobias are involved by using the phobia that currently causes the dysfunctional behaviour and coupling it with a phobia that produces a more intense reaction. This is meant to make the first phobia seem less fearsome etc. as it has been put in comparison with the second phobia. This model seems to have been quite successful, where phobias and compulsive disorders are concerned, but it doesn't focus on the cause of the illness or problem, and so risks recurrence of the problem.\n\nThe behavioural model overcomes the ethical issues raised by the medical model of labelling someone as 'ill' or 'abnormal'. Instead the model concentrates on behaviour and whether it is 'adaptive' or 'maladaptive'. The model also allows individual and cultural differences to be taken into account. Provided the behaviour is presenting no problems to the individual or to other people, then there is no need to regard the behaviour as a mental disorder. Those who support the psychodynamic model, however, claim the behavioural model focuses only on symptoms and ignores the causes of abnormal behaviour. They claim that the symptoms are merely the tip of the iceberg – the outward expression of deeper underlying emotional problems. Whenever symptoms are treated without any attempt to ascertain the deeper underlying problems, then the problem will only manifest itself in another way, through different symptoms. This is known as symptom substitution. Behaviourists reject this criticism and claim that we need not look beyond the behavioural symptoms as the symptoms are the disorder. Thus, there is nothing to be gained from searching for internal causes, either psychological or physical. Behaviourists point to the success of behavioural therapies in treating certain disorders. Others note the effects of such treatments are not always long lasting. Another criticism of the behavioural model are the ethical issues it raises. Some claim the therapies are dehumanising and unethical. For example, aversion therapy has been imposed on people without consent.\n\nThe cognitive model of abnormality focuses on the cognitive distortions or the dysfunctions in the thought processes and the cognitive deficiencies, particularly the absence of sufficient thinking and planning. This model holds that these variables are the cause of many psychological disorders and that psychologists following this outlook explain abnormality in terms of irrational and negative thinking with the main position that thinking determines all behaviour. \n\nThe cognitive model of abnormality is one of the dominant forces in academic psychology beginning in the 1970s and its appeal is partly attributed to the way it emphasizes the evaluation of internal mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, and problem-solving. The process allows psychologists to explain the development of mental disorders and the link between cognition and brain function especially to develop therapeutic techniques and interventions. \n\nWhen it comes to the treatment of abnormal behavior or mental disorder, the cognitive model is quite similar to the behavioural model but with the main difference that, instead of teaching the patient to behave differently, it teaches the patient to think differently. It is hoped that if the patient's feelings and emotions towards something are influenced to change, it will induce external behavioural change. Though similar in ways to the behavioural model, psychiatrists of this model use differing methods for cures. One key assumption in cognitive therapy is that treatment should include helping people restructure their thoughts so that they think more positively about themselves, their life, and their future. \n\nOne of the main treatments is rational emotive therapy (RET), which is based on the principle that an \"activating\" emotional event will cause a change in thoughts toward that situation, even if it is an illogical thought. So with this therapy, it is the psychiatrist's job to question and change the irrational thoughts. It is similar to the behavioural model where its success is concerned, as it has also proved to be quite successful in the treatment of compulsive disorders and phobias. Although it does not deal with the cause of the problem directly, it does attempt to change the situation more broadly than the behavioural model. Due to their respective characteristics and similarities, there are instances when psychologists combine cognitive and behavioural models to treat mental disorders.\n\nThe psychodynamic model is the fourth psychological model of abnormality, and is based on the work of Sigmund Freud. It is based on the principles that psychological illnesses come about from repressed emotions and thoughts from experiences in the past (usually childhood), and as a result of this repression, alternative behaviour replaces what is being repressed. The patient is believed to be cured when they can admit that which is currently being repressed (4). The main cure for illnesses under this model is free association where the patient is free to speak while the psychiatrist notes down and tries to interpret where the trouble areas are. This model can be successful, especially where the patient feels comfortable to speak freely and about issues that are relevant to a cure.\n\n", "id": "7739305", "categories": [], "title": "Models of abnormality"}

Rouen ducks are frequently used for meat. The breed originated in France sometime before the 19th century.\n\nThe plumage coloring of both the Rouen drake and the Rouen duck are nearly identical to that of the Mallard drake and Mallard duck. The Mallard color pattern is referred to as gray. Males have green heads, white collars, black tail coverts and dark, ashy brown tail feathers, a gray body, and a deep claret breast. The female Rouen hens are a consistent shade of mahogany brown, with a brown crown and tan eye-stripes extending from bill to the back of the eyes. Another feature of the female color pattern is the distinct, detailed penciling found on feathers of the head, neck, body, body, most of the wing and tail. Rouen females can be much darker brown than Mallard females. Both sexes also have blue speculum feathers. However, Rouen speculum feathers are brighter in color and larger in size than that of the Mallard. Adult Rouen ducks are typically significantly larger than Mallard ducks. The Rouen duckling is identical to the Mallard duckling in terms of plumage coloring. In North America, two distinct types are bred: the common, or production-bred, variety that is larger than a Mallard but has a typical duck conformation, and the much larger and squarer standard-bred variety. The production variety normally weighs 6–8 lbs (2.7–3.6 kg) while the standard-bred weighs 9–12 lb (4.1–5.4 kg).\n\nRouen ducklings can be distinguished from wild mallard ducklings by the presence of a second stripe which runs across their face, just under their eye, whereas mallard ducklings have only one stripe which runs across their eye.\n\nThe breed was first raised in France, but it was not until it reached England in the 19th century that it was refined into the breed recognized as the Rouen today. The French version resembled a larger than average Mallard, but by selective breeding the British developed the exhibition-type Rouen. The final product was a bird with a deep, long keel, boat-shaped profile, enormous appearance and refined markings, especially the penciling on the female. It was used chiefly as a roasting bird; though it produced 35 to 125 eggs a year, there were other breeds which were more reliable egg-layers with higher production. The eggs are typically white, but can have blue and green tints. Exhibition-typed Rouen ducks have been known to crush their eggs if allowed to set due to their massive frames. In 1861, Mrs. Beeton said of it:\n\nThe origin of the name is not known. When they arrived in England, they were variously called Rhône, after the region in southwest-central France, Rohan, after the cardinal of that name, Roan, for the mixture of colours, and Rouen after the northern French town, with Rouen eventually being adopted in both England and France. In France they are called Rouen Foncé (dark) as opposed to Rouen Clair, which are lighter in colour.\n\nIn 1850 the first Rouens were introduced to the United States by D. W. Lincoln of Worcester, Massachusetts, and used as general farm ducks until becoming popular as show birds. They were included in the \"Standard of Perfection\" of the American Poultry Association in 1874 and since then have won many titles, often having the most entries in the heavyweight class and doing well in competition with other breeds.\n\n\n", "id": "7739307", "categories": ["Duck breeds originating in France", "Animal breeds on the RBST Watchlist", "Duck breeds"], "title": "Rouen duck"}

She was 20 years old and eight months pregnant when she and Father Ladislao Gutiérrez faced a firing squad.\n\nCamila was born in Merced, Buenos Aires, the youngest daughter of Adolfo O'Gorman y Perichón Vandeuil, and his wife, Joaquina Ximénez Pinto. She was the second-to-last of six children in an upper-class family of mixed Irish, French and Spanish descent. Typical of powerful families in Argentina's post-colonial era, two of her brothers went on to pursue reputable careers. One as an ordained priest of the Jesuit Order, and the other as a police officer and the eventual founder of the Buenos Aires Police Academy.\n\nShe was also the granddaughter of Ana Périchon de O'Gorman (1776-1847), renowned lover of the Viceroy of the La Plata Santiago de Liniers, First Count of Buenos Aires. As the first British invasion occurred, Liniers was part of the defence of Buenos Aires. For heroic actions in defence of the city, Santiago de Liniers was appointed Military Governor of Buenos Aires, and Perichon de O'Gorman became the unofficial first lady. Her importance and power led to accusations intended to discredit her, including allegations that she was a spy for the French or the English. After Liniers died in 1810 she retired to a quieter life with her sons and died peacefully in 1847, at the age of 72.\n\nIn 1847 Argentina was governed by Juan Manuel de Rosas, a General of the Argentine Army and a politician. Rosas governed the Argentine Confederation by decree from 1829-52. Camila was considered a pillar of polite society, a close friend and confidante of Rosas' daughter, Manuelita, and a frequent guest at the Governors Residence. In her late teens, Camila was introduced to Father Ladislao Gutiérrez, a Jesuit priest who had attended seminary with her brother. \n\nAt the time, the Society of Jesus was the only institution within Argentina's Catholic Church which continued to speak out against Rosas' police state tactics. This led Rosas to later banish the Jesuits from Argentina. Father Gutiérrez came from a similar background; his uncle was the Provincial Governor of Tucumán, . Father Gutiérrez had been assigned as the parish priest of Nuestra Señora del Socorro (Our Lady of Relief) and was frequently invited to the O'Gorman family's estate. They soon began a clandestine affair.\n\nThey escaped in December 1847 and settled in Goya, Corrientes Province, where they set up the town's first school and posed as a married couple under false names. Corrientes was at the time under the control of Benjamín Virasoro, a warlord hostile to Rosas. As the scandal broke, Adolfo O'Gorman sent a letter to Rosas accusing Gutierrez of having seduced Camila, \"under the guise of religion\". Adolfo described himself and his family as heartbroken and pleaded that his daughter be rescued from the man he accused of having kidnapped her.\n\nRosas' exiled political opponents, and future President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento declared that Rosas was responsible for the moral corruption of Argentine womanhood. Camila and Ladislao were recognised by an Irish priest, Fr. Michael Gannon. Among others, Father Anthony Fahy and lawyer Dalmacio Vélez Sarsfield \"demanded an exemplary punishment of the wayward daughter that was also giving the industrious and well-regarded [Irish] community a bad name\". \n\nThe couple was abducted from Corrientes Province and returned to Buenos Aires. Camila claimed she had initiated her relationship with Gutierrez and insisted on their elopement, angrily denying rumors that she had been raped. From Buenos Aires, Rosas had given strict orders - the fugitives were to be sent to the prison of Santos Lugares (today San Andrés, General San Martín, Buenos Aires Province) in separate carriages - as indicated by Foreign Relations Minister Felipe Arana in his warrant of arrest.\n\nBefore reaching their final destination, Camila wrote to Manuelita Rosas, with the hope that she might persuade her father into granting clemency. Manuelita replied to her friend's letter, promising to help. Manuelita optimistically furnished a cell in a nearby Convent with a piano and books. However, Rosas denied his daughter's pleas and replied that this case, \"needs a show of my undisputed power, as the moral values and sacred religious norms of a whole society are at stake\". At the time, Rosas had removed the administration of justice from the courts and taken it upon himself. As per protocol, he signed a decree ordering the executions.\n\nImmediately after arriving to the prison, according to Canon Law, Father Castellanos, the prison chaplain, visited Camila’s cell and baptised her unborn baby. This consisted of Camila drinking holy water and placing consecrated ashes on her forehead. The next morning, 18 August 1848, O'Gorman and Gutiérrez were taken to the courtyard, tied to chairs, and blindfolded. Rosas accepted full responsibility for the execution, and said nobody had made any plea on behalf of the couple, overlooking the pleas of his own daughter, Manuelita. Many documents have survived, including a letter from Adolfo O'Gorman to Rosas, demanding \"exemplary punishment for the most atrocious and unheard of event in this country\".\n\nA book published in 1883, many years after the event, by Antonino Reyes, who had served Rosas for 14 years and was his aide-de-camp, secretary, Sergeant Major, and Chief of Police at Santos Lugares Prison. Reyes was so moved that he decided not to witness the executions and out of compassion ordered both bodies to be placed in the same coffin. Only then did he write to Rosas and inform him that his orders had been carried out. In the aftermath of their deaths, both friends and enemies of Rosas claimed to be appalled by the cruel and senseless execution, including Sarmiento and his fellow Unitarios, and wrote about it using terms such as \"the beautiful girl\", \"the doomed couple\" and \"the repression of love\". Camila was 20 years old and eight months pregnant with an illegitimate child. Father Gutiérrez was 24 years old.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7739321", "categories": ["Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery", "Argentine socialites", "Argentine people of Irish descent", "1820s births", "People from Buenos Aires", "People executed for blasphemy", "Executed Argentine women", "People executed by Argentina by firing squad", "1848 deaths", "Executed Argentine people"], "title": "Camila O'Gorman"}

Byrrah and Namor were close friends at childhood though they became rivals. Byrrah considered Namor a \"half-breed\" and unfit to rule Atlantis. Byrrah vied with Namor for the Atlantean throne when Emperor Thakorr was injured.\n\nByrrah was possible heir to the throne while Namor was gone. When Namor did return, Byrrah used a mind-control device to force the Atlanteans to choose him as ruler and exile Namor. Byrrah formed an alliance with Namor's enemies (Attuma and Warlord Krang) to defeat him, but failed and was exiled from Atlantis. With Krang and Doctor Dorcas, he unsuccessfully attempted to turn Atlantean public sentiment against Namor. He next formed alliances with Llyra and the Badoon, and battled Namor and Namorita. The two cousins later reconciled, and Namor pardoned Byrrah's crimes.\n\nByrrah brought word to Namor of Attuma's takeover of Atlantis. Alongside Namor, Byrrah battled Attuma's forces but they were defeated. Alongside Alpha Flight, Byrrah aided Namor and the Avengers against Attuma again.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739419", "text": "Control track\n\nA control track is a track that runs along an outside edge of a standard analog videotape (including VHS). The control track encodes a series of pulses, each pulse corresponding to the beginning of each frame. This allows the video tape player to synchronize its scan speed and tape speed to the speed of the recording. Thus, the recorded control track defines the speed of playback (e.g. SP, LP, EP, etc.), and it is also what drives the relative counter clock that most VCRs have.\n\nThe control track is used to fine-tune the tape speed during playback, so that the high speed rotating heads remained exactly on their helical tracks rather than somewhere between two adjacent tracks (known as \"tracking\"). Since good tracking depends on precise distances between the rotating drum and the fixed control/audio head reading the linear tracks, which usually varies by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances, most VCRs offer tracking adjustment, either manual or automatic, to correct such mismatches.\n\nThe control track is also used to hold \"index marks\", which were normally written at the beginning of each recording session, and can be found using the VCR's \"index search\" function: this will fast-wind forward or backward to the \"n\"th specified index mark, and resume playback from there. At times, higher-end VCRs provided functions for the user to manually add and remove these marks — so that, for example, they coincide with the actual start of the television program — but this feature later became hard to find.\n\nBy the late 1990s, some high-end VCRs offered more sophisticated indexing. For example, Panasonic's Tape Library system assigned an ID number to each cassette, and logged recording information (channel, date, time and optional program title entered by the user) both on the cassette and in the VCR's memory for up to 900 recordings (600 with titles).\n\nA gap in the control track signal of a videotape usually causes a flaw during playback, as the player may lose tracking as soon as the track drops out. This usually leads to a gap in video and audio (since there's no information as to what speed the media is recorded at), the VCR's counter will freeze, and upon re-acquiring the control track, the video sync will be momentarily lost.\n\nProblems with control track signals are almost always caused by a gap in recording, e.g. a recording was resumed \"beyond\" (rather than \"at\") the point where recording was previously stopped. A control track error can also be caused by a \"dropout\" - a defect in the magnetic particles on a tape - but this is very uncommon, as the control track is immune to all but the most severe tape damage.\n\nA discontinuous control track was (and still is) especially problematic for analog videotape editing. Each gap in the control track, no matter how brief, destroys synchronization and continuity, which can make a segment of a recorded video difficult or impossible to use for editing.\n\nThe acronym \"LOCT\" (pronounced \"locked\"), used by many video professionals, can mean \"Loss Of Control Track\" and/or \"Loss Of Continuous Timecode\". Though either type of \"loss\" can pose similar problems, and both issues are sometimes directly related, control track and timecode are two different things (see timecode).\n\nControl track problems cannot be \"repaired\". You can duplicate the tape to restore control track continuity, but this will not fix visual and audible \"glitches\" caused by gaps in the original control track, and the video itself will suffer quality degradation due to \"generation loss\".\n\nFor this reason, many video professionals would \"pre-stripe\" every analog videotape to be used in the field or studio beforehand to help ensure good control track throughout. This was done by pre-recording black to the entire videotape. Pre-striping also facilitated spot-checking for dropouts on the video portion of the tape (usually seen as brief white horizontal \"dashes\") before use.\n\n", "id": "7739419", "categories": ["Television technology", "VHS"], "title": "Control track"}

She is best known for the texts of nine cantatas, which Johann Sebastian Bach composed after Easter of 1725.\n\nChristiana Mariana Romanus was born in Leipzig, where her father served as mayor in 1701. She began her literary career after the death of her second husband, Captain von Ziegler in 1722. She returned to Leipzig, where she lived in the family home, the Romanushaus, with her mother. Her father had received a long-term prison sentence for financial irregularities. Despite the difficult family circumstances, the house became a literary and musical salon. Johann Christoph Gottsched encouraged her poetic activity. She became the first woman member of Gottsched's literary society, the \"Deutsche Gesellschaft\".\n\nIn 1741 she married for the third time and her literary activity ceased.\n\nShe died in Frankfurt an der Oder.\n\nBach moved to Leipzig in 1723 to take up the post of Thomaskantor. In this role he set about composing a large number of cantatas for performance in the city's churches. There is some uncertainty about who was writing Bach's libretti in his first couple of years in Leipzig. \nWhoever his original librettist was, Bach appears to have been looking for a new librettist in 1724, and this may be when he met Ziegler.\nThe nine cantatas set by Bach to texts by Ziegler are:\n\n\nThe question arises why Bach turned to other librettists. There were still texts by Ziegler unset. She published a cyle of cantata texts in 1728, the texts set by Bach and others not set by him.\nJohn Eliot Gardiner suggests that the relationship between the two may have been strained by Bach's habit of amending her texts to suit his purposes. There also seem to be some examples of lack of communication when Bach sets Ziegler's words by adapting music he had composed earlier (as for example in \"Er rufet seinen Schafen mit Namen\", BWV 175).\n\n\n\n", "id": "7739440", "categories": ["People from the Electorate of Saxony", "Women librettists", "1695 births", "German cantata librettists", "1760 deaths", "German women poets", "German salon-holders", "People from Leipzig"], "title": "Christiana Mariana von Ziegler"}

In 1915, his family's name was changed to Feldmeijer. He used only his middle name, making him Henk Feldmeijer. He graduated from high school in 1928 with top grades in every subject, and started studying mathematics and physics. He interrupted his education to perform national service in 1931. During this period he met a leader of the recently established Stormtroopers of the National Socialist Movement (NSB). He was inspired by the ideas of this movement to become member number 479 in 1932. As one of the first 1,000 members, he had direct access to the movement's leader Anton Mussert. He made many speeches in and around Groningen about the need of a strong leader (Mussert) and against democracy. His speaking talents were quickly recognized, and he got a paid position in the propaganda department. He made many journeys to Nazi Germany, during which he had meetings with SS members; he also visited Scandinavia and Mussolini's Italy. After failing his exams in 1935, he broke off his education and became a full-time employee of the NSB stationed in Utrecht. Because of his membership in the NSB he was fired as a reserve-officer of the army in 1935.\n\nFeldmeijer belonged to the \"volkisch\" group in the NSB, just like Meinoud Rost van Tonningen. This group tried to cultivate the Germanic part of Dutch history, and promoted a racist and anti-semitic view. Feldmeijer had many secret contacts in German SS circles, of which his NSB superiors were not aware. The \"Volkisch\" group in the NSB caused a radicalisation of the party's viewpoints. They idealised the lives of the \"Germanic\" forefathers of the Dutch people, and the proponents of these theories performed much research on these ideas. \n\nIn 1937, Feldmeijer became an important member of the organisation \"Der Vaderen Erfdeel\" (Heritage of our forefathers), renamed \"Volksche Werkgemeenschap\" (\"Volkisch\" working community) in 1940; This group performed the research for the Volkisch group in the NSB. The Dutch people had to learn to realise that their culture was a \"Germanic\" culture; an important step in the direction of the SS way of thinking. Feldmeijer was strongly attracted to the SS ideology, but had to keep his ties with this organisation a secret as the NSB did not fully appreciate this. \n\nIn the autumn of 1937, he was forced to leave the headquarters of the NSB in Utrecht because of a conflict with the NSB leader Anton Mussert, and was made the district leader of Salland. In August 1939 Rost van Tonningen appointed him as commander of the Mussert guards. Feldmeijer based the organisation of this paramilitary group of several hundred men on the SS organisation in Germany. In 1939 he made several trips to Berlin to advise the Germans on the Dutch language transmissions of Radio-Bremen. On 3 May 1940 the Dutch government imprisoned him in Fort Ooltgensplaat, where he shared a cell with Rost van Tonningen. He was later transported to France via Belgium, and on 30 May 1940 he was liberated by German troops in Calais. On 2 June 1940 Feldmeijer and Rost van Tonningen arrived back in Den Haag. That same night Rost van Tonningen was invited to a meeting with Heinrich Himmler and Artur Seyss-Inquart to discuss the nazification of the Netherlands and the establishment of a Dutch SS. A few days later, Rost van Tonningen introduced Feldmeijer to Hanns Albin Rauter, the German head of the Dutch occupied territories police, who was impressed with the vigour and charisma of the young Dutchman.\n\nFeldmeijer was tasked with establishing and commanding the Nederlandsche SS. Mussert had opposed the creation of the SS in the Netherlands, but German pressure had made him agree to its establishment. De Nederlandsche SS had a maximum membership of 4,000 on 1 November 1942. It always had a double standard, as it was seen as part of the NSB and at the same time part of the German SS. In theory, it was under the leadership of Anton Mussert but in reality Feldmeijer reported to Himmler and his representative in the Netherlands, Hanns Albin Rauter. Feldmeijer stimulated his members to contribute actively to the German war effort: he himself served at the front twice: April–May 1941 as a gunner in the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler in Yugoslavia and Greece, and June 1942 – March 1943 as Flak commander in SS-Division Wiking at the Eastern Front in Southern Russia. In March 1943 he was promoted to Standartenführer in the Allgemeine SS and in March 1944, after completion of an officer training course, he was promoted to Hauptsturmführer in the Waffen-SS. He was decorated with the Iron Cross 2nd Class, the Sturmabzeichen and the Verwundetenabzeichen in black.\n\nFeldmeijer had many conflicts with other members of the NSB because of his strong dedication to the SS. The SS wanted a complete integration of the Netherlands in the Greater German \"Reich\". On the other hand, Mussert wanted a German \"League of Nations\", with Germany as a leading member of the \"European union of states\". The German occupation authorities saw in Feldmeijer a willing tool to keep Mussert's ambitions in check. The conflict between the SS and the NSB came to a boil in May 1943, and while Feldmeijer and Mussert made a public appearance together to show their good relations, in practice all ties between the NSB and the German SS were severed.\n\nFeldmeijer supported the retaliatory measures taken against the resistance actions against NSB members. He was a member of the \"Sonderkommando-Feldmeijer\" between September 1943 and September 1944, and executed at least 20 people for resistance activities in an operation named \"Silbertanne Aktion\". Other prominent members of the commando were Heinrich Boere, and Klaas Carel Faber and his brother. In February 1945 he was appointed to command a battalion of the Landstorm Nederland. \n\nWhile driving to his position at the front, his car was strafed by an Allied fighter plane and Feldmeijer was killed. He was buried in Haren several days later. Himmler sent Rauter a telegram after hearing of the death of Feldmeijer:\n\n\"I am very sad over the death of Feldmeijer. Please convey my condolences to his wife. Feldmeijer was the future of Holland in my eyes. Don't bother to offer my condolences to Mister Mussert, as he never knew what kind of man he had in Feldmeijer.\"\n\n", "id": "7739499", "categories": ["National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands politicians", "Dutch collaborators with Nazi Germany", "People from Assen", "1945 deaths", "German military personnel killed in World War II", "1910 births"], "title": "Henk Feldmeijer"}

It commemorates the popular uprising which expelled Polish occupation forces from Moscow in November 1612, and more generally the end of the Time of Troubles and turning point of the Polish-Muscovite War (1605–1618).\n\nThe day's name alludes to the idea that all classes of Russian society united to preserve Russian statehood when there was neither a tsar nor a patriarch to guide them. In 1613 tsar Mikhail Romanov instituted a holiday named \"Day of Moscow’s Liberation from Polish Invaders\". It was celebrated in the Russian Empire until 1917, when it was replaced with a commemoration of the Russian Revolution. Unity Day was reinstituted by the Russian Federation in 2005, when the events of the year 1612 have been celebrated instead of those of 1917 every November 4 since. The day is also the feast day of the Russian Orthodox icon of Our Lady of Kazan.\n\nAccording to a poll in 2007, only 23 percent of Russians know the name of the holiday, up from 8 percent in 2005. 22 percent identified the holiday as the Day of Accord and Reconciliation, the name of the holiday on November 7 during the 1990s. Only 4 percent knew that the holiday commemorates the liberation of Moscow from Polish invaders, down from 5 percent in 2005.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin reestablished the holiday in order to replace the commemoration of the October Revolution, known as the Day of Great October Socialist Revolution during Soviet period and as the Day of Accord and Conciliation in post-Soviet times, which formerly took place on November 7. His decision angered some sections of the public, particularly the Communist Party, who continued with celebrations on November 7. Putin's predecessor, Boris Yeltsin took a limited action of changing the name of the holiday; by completely removing it, Putin initiated a controversy that continues today.\n\nThe center of the first of the revived tradition was Nizhny Novgorod, where monument to Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky and Vladimir Putin laid flowers. The Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus', Alexy II was also in attendance. Activities in Moscow, included two processions and a \"Russian March\". Religious processions occurred with local heads of administration in attendance. Fundraisers were held in Tula, a district art festival occurred for children with disabilities, and in Kaluga, veterans and orphans were given local confectionery products.\n\nA Russian Marc\" took place, despite bans in cities such as Moscow. A ninety-minute show involving more than a thousand actors was staged in Nizhny Novgorod.\n\n\"1612\", Vladimir Khotinenko's historical film dramatizing the event the holiday commemorates, was released on November 1. Thirty-nine events were held in Moscow alone. Vladimir Putin laid flowers at the monument to Minin and Pozharsky and presented the Pushkin Medal at a reception in the Moscow Kremlin, \"for the preservation of Russian spiritual heritage\" and \"promotion of the Russian language\".\n\nPresident Dmitry Medvedev laid flowers at the monument to Minin and Pozharsky and organized a reception in the Grand Kremlin Palace. In Revolution Square, 7,000 attended a meeting devoted to the Day of National Unity. Activists of the youth movement \"Nashi\" called for a day of \"under the covers\" - 10,000 young people gathered on Vasilevsky Descent Square to sew a patchwork of thousands into the so-called \"blanket the world\". There was a free rock festival \"Call\", aimed at combating negative phenomena among young people, such as drugs.\n\nA celebration was held of the consecration of the restored gate icon of St. Nicholas Mozhaiskogo on the Nikolskaya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin, with the participation of the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus', Kirill I.\n\nNizhny Novgorod was once again the center of the celebration. The organization of the regional government allocated a holiday budget of 15,200,000 rubles. Here, a sculpture 30 meters in length and about 5 meters in height was erected, with the image of Kozma Minin.\n\n", "id": "7739586", "categories": ["Russian society", "Public holidays in Russia", "Unity days", "November observances"], "title": "Unity Day (Russia)"}

They eventually separated, but only after Maria had given birth to her only son.\n\nShe moved to Saint Petersburg around 1830. Several years later she began writing to support herself and her child, and to pay off some of her husband's debts. Her first story appeared in 1837, and she published works regularly until her death. Her first success came with the two-volume \nstory collection \"Evenings on the Karpovka\" (1838-1839). Her two-volume collection \"Tales\" (1840) was well-received, as was her \"Sketches of Southern France and Nice\" (1844). Some of Zhukova's stories are historical, and some are set abroad with non-Russian characters, a common feature of Russian fiction in the Romantic period.\n\n\n", "id": "7739605", "categories": ["Women travel writers", "Russian writers", "19th-century Russian women writers", "People from Arzamas", "19th-century Russian writers", "1805 births", "1855 deaths", "Russian travel writers", "Russian women short story writers"], "title": "Maria Zhukova"}

King Hu was credited as the director but allegedly left the project midway, and the film was completed by a team led by producer Tsui Hark. The film is adapted from Louis Cha's novel \"The Smiling, Proud Wanderer\".\n\nThe film is set in the Ming dynasty, during the Wanli Emperor. Gu Jinfu, a eunuch from the spy agency Eastern Depot, leads a team to retrieve the \"Chrysanthemum Manual\", a martial arts manual which was stolen from the imperial palace. They track down and attack Lin Zhennan. Lin Zhennan encounters Linghu Chong and Yue Lingshan, two students from the Mount Hua Sect, and asks them to inform his son, Lin Pingzhi, where the manual is hidden.\n\nWhile making their way to rendezvous with their Mount Hua Sect fellows, Linghu Chong and Yue Lingshan chance upon Liu Zhengfeng, who is planning to retire from the \"jianghu\" (martial artists' community) with his friend Qu Yang. Just then, Zuo Lengshan, who works for Eastern Depot, shows up with his men and tries to arrest Linghu Chong and Qu Yang. Linghu Chong and the others manage to escape, but Liu and Qu are seriously wounded in the process. Before committing suicide, Liu and Qu perform \"Xiaoao Jianghu\", a musical piece they composed together, and pass their instruments and the score to Linghu Chong.\n\nLinghu Chong encounters the reclusive swordsman Feng Qingyang and learns the skill 'Nine Swords of Dugu' from him. He also finds out that his gentlemanly teacher, Yue Buqun, who leads the Mount Hua Sect, is actually a power-hungry hypocrite. In the meantime, Gu Jinfu's henchman, Ouyang Quan, impersonates Lin Pingzhi (who is dead) and infiltrates the Mount Hua Sect. He tricks Linghu Chong into revealing the whereabouts of the \"Sunflower Manual\" and then poisons him. Linghu Chong is saved by Ren Yingying and Lan Fenghuang from the Sun Moon Holy Cult. They combine forces to defeat and kill Zuo Lengshan and his men.\n\nAround the same time, Yue Buqun, Ouyang Quan, Gu Jinfu and the others have arrived at the location where the \"Sunflower Manual\" is hidden and are fighting over the manual. Linghu Chong shows up, kills Gu Jinfu, exposes Yue Buqun's treachery and defeats him. He decides to spend the rest of his life roaming the \"jianghu\" with his friends.\n\n\nThe theme song of the film, \"Chong Hoi Yat Sing Siu\" (滄海一聲笑; \"A Sound of Laughter in the Vast Sea\"), was composed by James Wong, who also wrote its lyrics, and performed in Cantonese by Sam Hui.\n\nThe film grossed HK$16,052,552 at the Hong Kong box office.\n\nCritical review of the film has found deep themes involving the film's exploration of the nature of power, loss, relationships and memory.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739652", "text": "Technical textile\n\nA technical textile is a textile product manufactured for non-aesthetic purposes, where function is the primary criterion. Technical textiles include textiles for automotive applications, medical textiles (e.g., implants), geotextiles (reinforcement of embankments), agrotextiles (textiles for crop protection), and protective clothing (e.g., heat and radiation protection for fire fighter clothing, molten metal protection for welders, stab protection and bulletproof vests, and spacesuits).\n\nThe sector is large, growing, and supports a vast array of other industries. The global growth rate of technical textiles is about 4% per year, which is greater than the growth rate of home and apparel textiles, which are growing at a rate of 1% per year. Currently, technical textile materials are most widely used in filter clothing, furniture, hygiene medicals and construction material.\n\nTechnical textiles can be divided into many categories, depending on their end use. The classification system developed by Techtextil, Messe Frankfurt Exhibition GmbH, is widely used in Europe, North America and Asia. Techtextil specifies 12 application areas: Agrotech, Buildtech, Clothtech, Geotech, Hometech, Indutech, Medtech, Mobiltech, Oekotech, Packtech, Protech, and Sporttech, Architech (Architectural textile), Military textiles,Autotech (Automobile textiles), Smartech (Smart Textiles), Wearable computers, . These are sometimes spelled Agrotex, Buildtex, Clothtex, Geotex, Hometex, Indutex, Medtex, Mobiltex, Oekotex (Ecotex), Packtex, Protex and Sportex\"\n\nTextiles used in Agriculture are termed as agro textiles. They are used for crop protection, fertilisation, ... The essential properties required are strength, elongation, stiffness, and bio-degradation, resistance to sunlight and resistance to toxic environment. All these properties help with the growth and harvesting of crops and other foodstuffs. There is a growing interest in using materials which gradually degrade.\n\nSome of the examples of Agro textiles are:\n\nConstruction textiles are used in: construction concrete reinforcement, façade foundation systems, interior construction, insulations, proofing materials, air conditioning, noise prevention, visual protection, protection against the sun, building safety.\n\nAn interesting and aesthetic appealing application is the use of textile membranes for roof construction. This area is also referred to as textile architecture. PVC coated high tenacity PES, teflon coated glass fibre fabrics or silicone coated PES are used for their low creep properties. Splendid examples of such construction are found in football stadia, airports and hotels.\n\nTechnical textiles for clothing applications. Especially in the finishing process where fabric is treated under pressure and high temperature the technical textile supports the fabric for smooth processing. This is usually the blend of polyester, modal, viscose, nylon, etc.\n\nThese are used in reinforcement of embankments or in construction work. The fabrics in geo textiles are permeable fabrics and are used with soils having ability to separate, filter, protect or drain. The application areas include civil engineering, earth and road construction, dam engineering, soil sealing and in drainage systems. The fabric used in it must have good strength, durability, low moisture absorption and thickness. Mostly nonwoven and woven fabrics are used in it. Synthetic fibers like glass, polypropylene and acrylic fibers are used to prevent cracking of the concrete, plastic and other building materials. Polypropylene and polyester are used in geo textiles and dry/liquid filtration due to their compatibility.\n\nTextiles used in a domestic environment - interior decoration and furniture, carpeting, protection against the sun, cushion materials, fireproofing, pillows, floor and wall coverings, textile reinforced structures/fittings.\n\nIn the contract market such as for large area buildings, ships, caravans, busses, ... fire retardant materials are used. Fire retardant properties are obtained either through the use of inherent fire retardant fibres such as modacryl or through the application of a coating with fire retardant additives (bromide of phosphorus compounds).\n\nTextiles used for chemical and electrical applications and textiles related to mechanical engineering. Silk-screen printing, filtration, plasma screens, propulsion technology, lifting/conveying equipment, sound-proofing elements, melting processes, roller covers, grinding technology, insulations, seals, fuel cell.\n\nTechnical textiles for Lifting applications. Used in process of lifting heavy goods. The textile produced is strongly woven with High tenacity yarns and the fabric is treated with heat and high temperature controlling its elongations. This is usually made of High tenacity polyester and Nylon however HMPE yarns as Dyneema are also used.\n\nThese textiles are used in the construction of automobiles, railways, ships, aircraft and spacecraft. Examples are Truck covers (PVC coated PES fabrics), car trunk coverings (often needle felts), lashing belts for cargo tie downs, seat covers (knitted materials), seat belts, non-wovens for cabin air filtration (also covered in indutech), airbags, parachutes, boats (inflatable), air balloons.\n\nThese textiles are used in automobiles, ships and aircraft. Many coated and reinforced textiles are used in materials for engines such as air ducts, timing belts, air filters, non-wovens for engine sound isolation... A number of materials are also used in the interior of cars. The most obvious are seat covers, safety belts and airbags but one can find textiles also for the sealing. Nylon gives strength and its bursting strength being high is used as air bags in cars.\n\nCarbon composites are mostly used in the manufacture of aeroplane parts while carbon fibre is used for making higher end tyres. High tensile polyester is used for making air balloons.\n\nNew applications for textiles in environmental protection applications - floor sealing, erosion protection, air cleaning, prevention of water pollution, water cleaning, waste treatment/recycling, depositing area construction, product extraction, domestic water sewerage plants.\n\nPackaging, silos, containers, bags, lashing straps, canvas covers, marquee tents.\n\nThe main target of the technical protective fabrics is to improve people safety in their workplaces. A technical protective fabric can save a worker's life, that's why, most of them are mainly used to manufacture PPE (personal protective equipment). \nThe demand of these fabrics is growing around the world thank to the sensibilitization of the society, requiring more safety at work. There are some organizations around the world (ASTM and ISO) which describe the requirements and regulations, to fulfill by a fabric, to be considered as a technical protective fabric.\nThe aim of a technical protective fabric isn't fashion, they are designed to have extra values in protection, against some hazards.\n\nNowadays it can be found in the market, technical fabrics which protect of: \n\nThese fabrics are made of different kind of fibers, because every blend apports different technical characteristics to the fabric:\n\n\nShoes, sports equipment, flying and sailing sports, climbing, angling, cycling, winter and summer sports, indoor sport it can vary from anything including sports bags.\n\nFor industrial applications and in power transmission, technical textiles are used in conveyor belts. Carcass is a fabric inside the conveyor belt, which is responsible for the strength and stretch properties of the belt. This carcass is made with layers of woven fabrics bonded together.\n\nIt has been heard that soon textiles will be merged with electronics in all areas. In future wearable computers would be launched, these will not be like advance wrist watches etc., they will contain IC s in fabric to develop fabric keyboards and other wearable computer devices. These types of products are known as Interactive electronic textiles (IET). Research to support IET development is being conducted in many universities. Growing consumer interest in mobile, electronic devices will initiate the demand for IET products.\n\n\n", "id": "7739652", "categories": [], "title": "Technical textile"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739695", "text": "Ulmus 'Exoniensis'\n\nUlmus 'Exoniensis', the 'Exeter Elm', was discovered near Exeter, England, in 1826, and propagated by the Ford & Please nursery in that city. Traditionally believed to be a cultivar of the Wych Elm \"U. glabra\", its fastigiate shape when young, upward-curving tracery, small samarae and leaves, late leaf-flush and late leaf-fall, taken with its south-west England provenance, suggest a link with the Cornish Elm, which shares these characteristics.\n\nThe tree initially has an upright, columnar form, but later develops a large rounded crown and occasionally reaches 17 m in height. Older specimens may develop pendulous branches. Exeter Elm is chiefly distinguished by its contorted leaves, < 11 cm long by 8 cm broad, rounder than the type [wych] and with more laciniate margins, which occasionally wrap around the branchlets and remain thus well into winter. 'Exoniensis' is often pollarded to produce a denser, fan-shaped crown (see main picture). \nChevalier noted (1942) that \"Ulmus montana fastigiata\" (Exeter Elm) was one of four European cultivars found by researchers in The Netherlands to have significant resistance to the earlier strain of Dutch elm disease prevalent in the 1920s and '30s, the others being 'Monumentalis' , 'Berardii' and 'Vegeta'. The four were rated less resistant than \"U. foliacea\" clone 23, from Spain, later cultivated as 'Christine Buisman'. 'Exoniensis' possesses a moderate resistance to the more virulent strain of Dutch elm disease, and consequently often featured in the Dutch elm breeding programme in association with the Field Elm (\"U. minor\") and Himalayan Elm (\"U. wallichiana\").\n\nOnce commonly planted in the UK and parts of western Europe, 'Exoniensis' is also known to have been marketed in Poland in the 19th century by the Ulrich nursery, Warsaw, and remains in commerce there. The Späth nursery of Berlin cultivated the tree as \"U. montana fastigiata\" (\"U. exoniensis\" ) from the early 20th century. It is possible that three trees supplied by the Späth nursery to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as \"U. montana fastigiata\" were Exeter Elm, old specimens of which survive in Edinburgh (it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city). In Sweden 'Exoniensis' is sometimes pruned from an early age to form a tidy cone-shaped tree called locally 'pyramidalm' (: pyramid elm - also one of Späth's names for 'Exoniensis'). It is found in Australia at the Ballarat Botanical Gardens where it is listed on the Significant Tree Register of the National Trust. An \"Ulmus plumosa\" (a synonym of 'Exoniensis' in continental Europe), of \"elegant and pyramidal shape\" and \"dark green foliage\", appeared in the 1902 catalogue of the Bobbink and Atkins nursery, Rutherford, New Jersey.\nBean (1936) noted a large old specimen, 12 feet in girth, in the garden of the Old Vicarage, Bitton, Gloucestershire. A 180-year-old specimen in Hamburg has attained a height of 28 m and a trunk diameter of 1.45 m. The UK TROBI Champion tree is in Scotland, at Baxter Gardens, Dundee, measuring 15 m high by 103 cm d.b.h. in 2004. The cultivar is represented in Éire by a tree at Birr Castle (Mount Palmer), County Offaly, with a d.b.h. of 29 cm when measured in 2002.\n\n'Clusius', 'Columella', 'Dodoens', 'Lobel', 'Plantyn', 'Nanguen' = ™, 'Wanoux' = ™. The cultivar 'Columella' features the same rough, rounded, contorted leaves, the result of a recessive gene inherited from the Exeter Elm. \n\n'Exoniensis' also indirectly featured in the Italian elm breeding programme as an ancestor of 'Plantyn', which was crossed with clones of the Siberian Elm \"Ulmus pumila\" to produce the cultivars 'Arno', 'Plinio', and 'San Zanobi'.\n\n<section begin=Synonymy />\n<section end=Synonymy />\n\n\n", "id": "7739695", "categories": ["Unconfirmed derivation elm cultivar", "Ulmus articles with images"], "title": "Ulmus 'Exoniensis'"}

So, formula_2 is a semiprime ideal of the integers (because 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, with no repeated prime factors), but formula_3 is not (because 12 = 2 × 3, with a repeated prime factor).\n\nThe class of semiprime rings includes semiprimitive rings, prime rings and reduced rings.\n\nMost definitions and assertions in this article appear in and .\n\nFor a commutative ring \"R\", a proper ideal \"A\" is a semiprime ideal if \"A\" satisfies either of the following equivalent conditions:\n\nThe latter condition that the complement is \"closed under powers\" is analogous to the fact that complements of prime ideals are closed under multiplication.\n\nAs with prime ideals, this is extended to noncommutative rings \"ideal-wise\". The following conditions are equivalent definitions for a semiprime ideal \"A\" in a ring \"R\":\n\nHere again, there is a noncommutative analogue of prime ideals as complements of m-systems. A nonempty subset \"S\" of a ring \"R\" is called an n-system if for any \"s\" in \"S\", there exists an \"r\" in \"R\" such that \"srs\" is in \"S\". With this notion, an additional equivalent point may be added to the above list:\n\n\nThe ring \"R\" is called a semiprime ring if the zero ideal is a semiprime ideal. In the commutative case, this is equivalent to \"R\" being a reduced ring, since \"R\" has no nonzero nilpotent elements. In the noncommutative case, the ring merely has no nonzero nilpotent right ideals. So while a reduced ring is always semiprime, the converse is not true.\n\nTo begin with, it is clear that prime ideals are semiprime, and that for commutative rings, a semiprime primary ideal is prime.\n\nWhile the intersection of prime ideals is not usually prime, it \"is\" a semiprime ideal. Shortly it will be shown that the converse is also true, that every semiprime ideal is the intersection of a family of prime ideals.\n\nFor any ideal \"B\" in a ring \"R\", we can form the following sets:\n\nThe set formula_5 is the definition of the radical of \"B\" and is clearly a semiprime ideal containing \"B\", and in fact is the smallest semiprime ideal containing \"B\". The inclusion above is sometimes proper in the general case, but for commutative rings it becomes an equality.\n\nWith this definition, an ideal \"A\" is semiprime if and only if formula_6. At this point, it is also apparent that every semiprime ideal is in fact the intersection of a family of prime ideals. Moreover, this shows that the intersection of any two semiprime ideals is again semiprime.\n\nBy definition \"R\" is semiprime if and only if formula_7, that is, the intersection of all prime ideals is zero. This ideal formula_8 is also denoted by formula_9 and also called Baer's lower nilradical or the Baer-Mccoy radical or the prime radical of \"R\".\n\nA right Goldie ring is a ring that has finite uniform dimension (also called \"finite rank\") as a right module over itself, and satisfies the ascending chain condition on right annihilators of its subsets. Goldie's theorem states that the \"semiprime\" right Goldie rings are precisely those that have a semisimple Artinian right classical ring of quotients. The Artin–Wedderburn theorem then completely determines the structure of this ring of quotients.\n\n\n", "id": "7739701", "categories": ["Ring theory"], "title": "Semiprime ring"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739717", "text": "Hanns Albin Rauter\n\nJohann Baptist Albin Rauter (4 February 1895 – 24 March 1949) was a high-ranking Austrian-born SS functionary and war criminal during the Nazi era. He was the highest SS and Police Leader in the occupied Netherlands and therefore the leading security and police officer there during the period of 1940–1945. Rauter reported directly to the Nazi SS chief, Heinrich Himmler, and in the second instance to the Nazi governor of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart. After World War II, he was convicted in the Netherlands of crimes against humanity and executed by firing squad.\n\nBorn in Klagenfurt, Rauter graduated from High school in 1912 and started training as an Engineer at the Graz University of Technology. At the outbreak of World War I Rauter volunteered for service in the Austro-Hungarian Army. He served with a \"Gebirgsschützenregiment\" and was discharged in 1919, having reached the rank of Oberleutnant. Rauter took part in the \"Kärntner Freiheitskampf\" of 1919, and from May until July 1921 he fought in the Freikorps Oberland in Oberschlesien. For his service during the war, Rauter received several decorations including Austrian Military Merit Cross 3rd Class with War decoration, Silver Medal for Bravery, Wound Medal or Karl Troop Cross.\n\nRauter first met Adolf Hitler in 1929 and joined the National Socialist cause in Austria. His forays in Austria forced him to flee to Germany in 1933, where he became part of the NSDAP department for Austria. He joined the SA, and was active in planning illegal NSDAP activities in Austria. In 1935 he left the SA to become a member of the SS. Until 1940 he was the Leader of the SS Southeast department in Breslau.\n\nIn May 1940 he was appointed \"Generalkommissar für das Sicherheitswesen\" (General Commissioner for Security) and \"Höherer SS-und Polizeiführer\" (Higher SS and Police leader) for the occupied Netherlands. In his position as police commander and highest ranking SS leader in the Netherlands, Rauter was responsible for the deportation of 110,000 Dutch Jews to the Nazi concentration camps (6,000 survived) and the repression of the Dutch resistance. He had 300,000 Dutchmen deported to Germany for forced labour. His first victims to die were those killed during the armed break up of the February strike on 26 February 1941, accounting for 9 dead that day: he also immediately declared a state of emergency and ordered summary executions.\n\nHe was the chief promoter of terror through summary arrests and internment in the Netherlands. The SS set up a concentration camp named Herzogenbusch after the city of 's-Hertogenbosch, but located in the neighboring town of Vught that gave the camp its name: Kamp Vught. In total this camp detained 31,000 people, of whom some 735 were killed. Also, his SS manned a so-called \"polizeiliches Durchgangslager\" or police transit camp near Amersfoort, known as Kamp Amersfoort, in fact also a concentration camp, where some 35,000 people were detained and maltreated and 650 people (Dutch and Russian) died. Rauter's SS also managed the Kamp Westerbork (\"polizeiliches Durchgangslager Westerbork\"), the place from which some 110,000 Dutch Jews were deported to Nazi concentration and extermination camps, mainly Auschwitz and Sobibor.\n\nUnder Rauter's guidance, a special block was built for 'political prisoners' (i.e. resistance workers) in the Scheveningen prison. These were often held in indefinite detention. In total 28,000 people were detained here over 4 years; many were severely mistreated, some were tried and 738 men and 21 women died here or on the nearby execution field, the Waalsdorpervlakte (now a national place of remembrance).\n\nRauter also instigated a system of retaliation for assaults on Nazi officials and their Dutch collaborators: one killed Nazi equalled ten Dutch victims, one killed Dutch collaborator equalled three Dutch victims. During 1944 these numbers sharply increased with the rise of resistance violence.\n\nDuring the Allied assault on Arnhem in Operation Market Garden, Rauter took the active field command of the \"Kampfgruppe Rauter\" during operations in the Veluwe area and near the bridges over the IJssel river. \"Kampfgruppe Rauter\" consisted of the Landstorm Nederland, \"Wachbataillon Nordwest\" and a regiment of the \"Ordnungspolizei\". After the assault on Arnhem had been fought off by the Germans, Rauter was given the command of the Maas front as a General in the Waffen-SS.\n\nIn the night of 6–7 March 1945 he was severely wounded by an attack staged by the Dutch resistance at Woeste Hoeve on the Veluwe, a little village between Arnhem and Apeldoorn. As a reprisal the Germans executed 117 political prisoners at the location of the attack as well as 50 prisoners in Kamp Amersfoort and 40 prisoners each in The Hague and Rotterdam—the reprisal by Karl Eberhard Schöngarth killed a total of 263 persons [including one German soldier]. This attack had not been planned; the resistance merely wanted to hijack a truck and use it to drive to a farmer who had butchered cows for the German army. Instead of the truck, Rauter's BMW motorcar was stopped by members of the resistance dressed in German uniforms. However, Rauter had just two weeks earlier issued a directive stating that German patrols should not stop any German military vehicles outside towns or villages, and a firefight broke out. His fellow passengers were all killed, but Rauter feigned death and survived. He was found by a German military patrol and transferred to a hospital where he remained until his arrest by British Military Police after the end of hostilities.\n\nRauter was handed over to the Dutch government by the British and was tried by a special court in The Hague. Rauter denied committing war crimes but the court found him guilty and sentenced him to death. A film record was made of the trial.\n\nThe death sentence was confirmed by a higher court on 12 January 1949 and he was executed by firing squad near Scheveningen on 24 March 1949. The location of his grave remains a state secret.\n", "id": "7739717", "categories": ["SS-Obergruppenführer", "People from Klagenfurt", "SS and Police Leaders", "20th-century Freikorps personnel", "People executed by the Netherlands by firing squad", "Austrian people executed abroad", "People from the Duchy of Carinthia", "Executed Austrian Nazis", "Members of the Reichstag of Nazi Germany", "1895 births", "Sturmabteilung officers", "1949 deaths", "Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I", "Holocaust perpetrators in the Netherlands", "Waffen-SS personnel"], "title": "Hanns Albin Rauter"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739729", "text": "Influencer marketing\n\nInfluencer marketing (also influence marketing or social media influencer) today is a form of marketing in the social media, by social media influencers.\n\nInfluencer content may be framed as testimonial advertising where they play the role of a potential buyer themselves, or they may be third parties. These third parties exist either in the supply chain (retailers, manufacturers, etc.) or may be so-called value-added influencers (such as journalists, academics, industry analysts, and professional advisers).\n\nIn the United States, influence marketing is treated by the Federal Trade Commission as a form of paid endorsement, governed under the rules for native advertising; the agency applies established truth-in-advertising standards to such advertising and establishes requirements for disclosure on the part of endorsers (influencers).\n\nOther countries' media-regulatory bodies, such as Australia's, have created guidelines around influencer marketing following the decision of the FTC. In the United Kingdom a voluntary agreement was announced in January 2019 between the country's Competition and Markets Authority and high-profile social media influencers to ensure that they comply with consumer law. Most countries have not created a regulatory framework for influencer marketing.\n\nMost discussion on the generic topic of social influence centres on compliance and persuasion in a social environment. In the context of influencer marketing, influence is less about argument and coercion to a particular point of view and more about loose interactions between various parties in a community. Influence is often equated to advocacy, but may also be negative, and is thus related to concepts of promoters and detractors.\n\nThe idea of a \"two-step flow of communication\" was introduced in \"The People's Choice\" (Paul Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, and Hazel Gaudet, a 1940 study on the decision making process of voters). This idea was further developed in \"Personal Influence\" (Lazarsfeld, Elihu Katz 1955) and \"The Effects of Mass Communication\" (Joseph Klapper 1960).\n\nInfluencer marketing tends to be broken into two sub-practices: earned influencer marketing and paid influencer marketing. Earned marketing stems from unpaid or preexisting relationships with influencers or third party content that is promoted by the influencer to further their own personal social growth. Paid influencer marketing campaigns can take the form of sponsorship, pre-roll advertising or testimonial messaging and can appear at any point in the content. Influencer compensation can be based on a flat rate fee per piece of content, earned as affiliate income resulting from sales or click-throughs generated by the influencer's content, or might be a combination of the two where influencers are paid a fee as well as earning affiliate income from their content. Budgets vary widely and are usually based on audience reach. Most influencers are paid upfront before a marketing campaign while others are paid after the execution of the marketing campaign. \n\nSome influencers accept gifted products or services as compensation in exchange for posting. However, these gifts are subject to IRS rules & regulations and in many cases their value is considered taxable income.\n\nAs a company's brands evolve in terms of marketing, the cost in relation to the possible benefits (i.e., purchase) it can receive is very important. The airing of a television spot has a high cost; conversely, working with an influencer has a negligible cost. If influencers have 200,000 followers on their social media site, and a company gives them a product specifically as a marketing tool, which they are to expose to their audience, the company's financial outlay, by comparison, would be negligible. The company will have spent less (the cost of the product), but exposed their product to a more focused group of followers (and therefore potential purchasers) of the public figure.\n\nAs more people use the internet, more are making purchases online. This forces some companies to invest more resources in their general advertising - on the internet, and on social networks in particular. Marketing through social networks allows for an instantaneous purchase process; a person can see the item and typically be connected to an online retailer immediately. This decrease between lag time - from seeing the promoted item and being redirected to the product - is more effective for spontaneous purchases.\n\nMany influencers' social media presence is on both Instagram and Twitter. The rise in popularity of video content means a growing number of influencers can also be found on YouTube.\n\nWeb services can be used to trawl social media sites for users who exert influence in their respective communities. The social influencer marketing firm then asks those influencers to try products or services and discuss them on their respective social networks. Clients can then observe an enhanced digital dashboard, with metrics that measure the dissemination of brand mentions across numerous web platforms.\n\nAt least 70 companies offer online influence measurement. Advocates of this online-only approach claim that online activity reflects (or pre-empts) the trends in offline transactions. For example, Razorfish released one of the first social influencer marketing reports, titled Fluent. The report discusses many theories surrounding social marketing, including the importance of the push/pull dynamic and online consumer empowerment, authenticity and importance of buzz marketing.\n\nOnline activity can be a core part of offline decision-making, as consumers research products and review sites.\n\nCritics of this online-only approach argue that only researching online sources misses critical influential individuals and inputs. They note that much influential exchange of information occurs in the offline world, and is not captured in online media. Indeed, the majority of consumer exchanges occur face-to-face, not in an online environment, as evidenced by Carl. He notes that \"an overwhelming majority of word-of-mouth (WOM) episodes (nearly 80%) ... occur in face-to-face interpersonal settings, while online WOM accounted for only seven to ten percent of the reported (WOM) episodes.\"\n\nCarl concludes that \"The majority of the WOM action still seems to be happening in the offline world. These findings are especially provocative since they emerge at a time when more and more organizations are paying attention to how their brands are discussed online and recent academic research has focused on online WOM. Thus it is important for organizations to keep both online and offline conversations on their radar screen.\"\n\nKeller Fay announced in 2007 that \"While experts have previously estimated that 80% of marketing-relevant word of mouth takes place 'offline' (i.e., face-to-face or via telephone), the new results indicate that this figure is even higher – 92%.\"\n\nMore recently, Nate Elliott at Forrester observed that \"the huge majority of users influence each other face to face rather than through social online channels like blogs and social networks.\"\n\nWith any marketing strategy, risks are involved, and there have been reports of brands dropping their influencers because of the controversies that surround them. One such influencer is YouTuber PewDiePie, whose use of antisemitic and racist comments lead to canceled deals from Disney and widespread backlash.\n\nSome marketers use influencer marketing to establish credibility in the market, others to create social conversations around their brand, and others to drive online or in-store sales of their products. The influencer marketer can also take to marketing diversified products and services leveraging, leveraging upon the credibility earned over time. The value which influencer marketing creates can be measured in several ways. Some marketers measure earned media value, others track impressions, and others track cost per action.\n\nInfluencer marketing derives its value from three sources:\n\nInfluencer marketing, in a commercial context, comprises four main activities:\n\n\nInfluencer marketing is continuously improved by constant evaluation done simultaneously with the four main activities.\n\nInfluencer marketing is not synonymous with word of mouth marketing (WOM), but influence may be communicated this way. WOM is a central to the mechanics of influencer marketing.\n\nThere is no consensus on what an \"influencer\" is. One writer defines them as \"a range of third parties who exercise influence over the organization and its potential customers\". Another defines an influencer as a \"third party who significantly shapes the customer's purchasing decision, but may never be accountable for it.\" Another says influencers are \"activists, are well-connected, have impact, have active minds, and are trendsetters\", though this set of attributes is aligned specifically to consumer markets.\n\nExactly what is included in influencer marketing depends on the context (retail or B2B) and the medium of influence transmission (online or offline, or both), as company's are increasingly eager to identify and work with influencers.\n\nBusiness is working harder and paying more to pursue people who are trying to watch and listen less to its messages. Targeting influencers is seen as a method of increasing the reach of marketing messages, in order to counteract the growing tendency of prospective customers to ignore marketing.\n\nThe first step in influencer marketing is to identify influencers. They are specific to discrete market segments, and are used as conduits to the entire target segment. While there are lists of generic influencers (such as the Time 100), they have limited use in marketing programmes targeted at specific segments.\n\nMarket research techniques can be used to identify influencers, using pre-defined criteria to determine the extent and type of influence.\n\n\nIn a study of what traits are associated with the top influencers, one researcher found four archetypes of influencers.\n\nMalcolm Gladwell notes that “the success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts”, and identified three types of influencer, who are responsible for the \"generation, communication and adoption\" of messages.:\n\n\nConnectors network across a variety of people, and thus have a wide reach. They are essential for word of mouth communication.\n\nMavens look to consume information and share it with others, and are extremely insightful with regards to trends.\nSalesmen are \"charismatic persuaders\". Their source of influence leans toward the tendency of others to attempt to imitate their behaviour.\n\nCurrently, most material on influencers focuses on consumer markets, rather than business-to-business influencers. A key distinction is that most of the focus in consumer markets is on consumer influencers themselves, primarily because word of mouth communication is prevalent in consumer environments. In business marketing, influencers are people who affect a sale, but are typically removed from the actual purchase decision. Consultants, analysts, journalists, academics, regulators, and standards bodies are examples of business influencers.\n\nNot all business influencers are equal. Some have more influence than others, and some mechanism of ranking is required, to distinguish between key influencers and less impactful people. One model for ranking business influencers looks at various criteria:\n\n\nVarious companies worldwide have developed their own proprietary methodologies for identifying and targeting influencers for a market (or market sector).\n\nInfluencers can also be defined by their number of followers. \"Top-influencers\", influencers with large followings, become celebrities(or already were) with strong reach and can command 6 and 7-figure fees for a single post. However, \"micro-influencers\" are more available to their audiences, create more focused, retainable and attainable content, and in the long run generate higher engagement rates.\n\nUnder United States law, those who endorse products or service, and/or provide testimonials for products or services, are obligated to disclose brand information to their target audience and follow other relevant guidelines. However, that doesn't stop some content providers, and the like, from being deceptive about their opinion to ensure they make money. This often makes them subject to backlash from consumers who spend money on products that fail to uphold their intended purpose.\n\nIn 2014, YouTube beauty guru Nicole Guerriero was criticized in a series of hateful comments on her Instagram page. Fans were outraged after purchasing Bellami hair extensions and believing that the company that sponsored Guerriero was misleading consumers into thinking their hair extensions were of the same quality of those sent in PR packages to promote on YouTube and Instagram by influencers. This prompted Guerriero to upload a video on YouTube addressing people's concerns with the product.\n\nA large influencer sponsor in 2018 across all social media platforms has been the brand Zaful, a clothing company based in China. The company promises cheap discounted clothing along with free shipping. Many complaints have been made by consumers on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Consumers claim that the company uses images of clothing from other brands, deceiving people into purchasing items that are not as shown. Poor quality and shipping issues are often cited. The company also falls under the category of \"fast fashion\", where sweatshops are used to create clothing to ensure it can be sold to consumers for a low price.\nIn November 2018, YouTube makeup artist James Charles announced he would be releasing an eyeshadow palette in collaboration with Morphe. Weeks before the release, he uploaded a video swatching the colours. A YouTuber named Kuckian then released a video calling the swatches a scam, and calling out Charles for editing the video in a such a way that misleads consumers, not giving them a fair idea of what the pigment truly looks like on skin. Reactions to the video were mixed, with some people coming to Charles' defense calling Kuckian a liar, and others sending hateful tweets to Charles directly.\n\nIn an interview with Ashley Graham, Kim Kardashian admitted to being offered one million dollars to post an image of herself on Instagram wearing clothing from a brand she did not name. Kardashian explained that she had turned down the deal because this brand tends to steal ideas from her husband's clothing line, Yeezy. She also claimed the company was notorious for making money from her and her sisters' red carpet and everyday looks.\n\nBrand deals are likely to break, and sponsors are just as likely to pull out of backings, if an influencer is under scrutiny. Making money is the primary goal, and if a brand risks being tarnished at the hands of controversy, businesses are quick to pull the plug. High-profile actors, influencers, YouTubers and others in the field of entertainment have lost brand deals based on inappropriate comments, poor judgement, and a lack of knowledge.\n\nIn 2017, highest ranked YouTuber in the world PewDiePie was also under fire for using a racial slur during a videogame live stream. Since then, YouTube has dropped AdSense from his videos, a source of income, and they cancelled the second season of his YouTube Red show. Disney, a sponsor, also parted ways with the YouTuber.\n\nFake influencers have been around as long as their real counterparts have. All measurements used to determine the veracity of an influencer account can be fabricated. Instagram has shut down third-party sites and apps which provide paid services to individual accounts for buying followers, likes, comments and more. Despite these shutdowns, self-hosted automation apps such as FollowLiker have continued to operate.\n\nA marketing agency conducted an experiment to test whether fake influencer accounts can profit. The company created two fictitious accounts - with their presence built up with bought followers and engagement (likes and comments) - and applied to campaigns on popular influencer marketing websites. They published their experiment with a step-by-step explanation of how the accounts were created, and the brands which sponsored them.\n\nInfluencer marketing works so well because of social media. When it comes to ads, many people ignore or fast forward them on TV, and a majority completely bypass them online with tools like AdBlock.\n\nAn analysis of more than 7,000 UK influencers showed that about half the followers of influencers with up to 20,000 followers are \"low-quality\", due to the inclusion of mass followers, internet bots, and other suspicious accounts. More than 4 of 10 engagements with this group of influencers are \"non-authentic\".\n\nA study of UK influencers which looked at almost 700,000 posts from the first half of 2018 found that 12% of UK influencers had bought fake followers.\n\nSources of influencers can be varied. Marketers traditionally target influencers that are easy to identify, such as press, industry analysts and high-profile executives. For most B2C purchases, however, influencers might include people known to the purchaser and the retailer staff. In higher-value business-to-business (B2B) transactions the community of influencers may be wide and varied, and include consultants, government-backed regulators, financiers and user communities.\n\nForrester analyst Michael Speyer notes that, for small and medium-size businesses, \"IT sales are influenced by many parties, including peers, consultants, bloggers, and technology resellers\". He advises that \"Vendors need to identify and characterize the influencers in their market. This requires a comprehensive influencer identification program and the establishment of criteria for ranking influencer impact on the decision process.\"\n\nAs well as a variety of influencer sources, influencers can play a variety of roles at different times in a decision process. This idea has been developed in influencer marketing by Brown and Hayes. They map out how and when particular types of influencer affect the decision process. This then enables marketers to selectively target influencers depending on their individual profile of influence.\n\nIn order to achieve the purpose of the business clients, influencers should deliver a change in attitude towards the client's brand or product. The change of the attitude from the viewer takes places from the contents that influencer produces. The change itself is believed as a psychological process in human mind. The psychological process can be explained under the RACE model (reach, act, convert and engage). These four steps are designed to help brands engage with their customers throughout the customer lifecycle.\n\n\n", "id": "7739729", "categories": ["Marketing by target group", "Promotion and marketing communications", "Influence (social and political)"], "title": "Influencer marketing"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739766", "text": "I Was Only 19\n\n\"Only 19\", \"I Was Only 19\" or \"A Walk in the Light Green\" is the most widely recognised song by Australian folk group Redgum. The song was released in March 1983 as a single, which hit number one on the national Kent Music Report Singles Chart for two weeks. It was also recorded for Redgum's live album \"Caught in the Act\" (Epic Records) released in June, which stayed in the top 40 of the Kent Music Report Albums Chart for four months. Royalties for the song go to the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. It is in the Australasian Performing Right Association's Top 30 Australian Songs of all time.\n\nThe song is a first-person account of a typical Australian soldier's experience in the Vietnam War, from training in Australia to first hand exposure to military operations and combat, and ultimately his return home disillusioned, psychologically scarred and possibly suffering from the effects of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the subject of this song is a volunteer member of the Australian Army, and not a conscript. Australian men did not become eligible for conscription until the age of 21.\n\nRedgum's lead vocalist-guitarist, John Schumann, wrote the song based on experiences he heard from veterans — particularly Mick Storen (his brother in-law) and Frankie Hunt: \"The power derives from the detail, provided by my mate and brother-in-law, Mick Storen, who was brave and trusting enough to share his story with me.\" — John Schumann\n\nFor the live version, Schumann explained the title, \"A Walk in the Light Green\", as referring to operational patrols in areas marked light green on topographical maps, where dark green indicated thick jungle, plenty of cover and few land mines and light green indicated thinly wooded areas, little cover and a high likelihood of land mines.\n\nThe Australian Vietnam Veterans' \"Welcome Home Parade\" was held in Sydney on 3 October 1987 and was followed by a concert in The Domain where Redgum's Schumann performed his song with veteran Frank Hunt on stage. From this parade, a desire for a War Memorial to commemorate Vietnam Veterans grew into fruition with the Memorial's dedication in October 1992. Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial was constructed in Anzac Parade, Canberra in 1992 and includes a \"Wall of Words\": \"Stele B, the northern or right-hand stele, is adorned with a series of 33 quotations fixed in stainless steel lettering.\" Amongst the quotations is:\n\nA \"normal language\" explanation of each quote has been included, courtesy of the late Brigadier Alf Garland:\n\nAt the 40th-year commemoration of the Battle of Long Tần, 18 August 2006, veterans were accompanied by Australian Ambassador Bill Tweddle at the Long Tan Cross; following the commemoration a concert was held at Vũng Tàu where Schumann (and The Vagabond Crew) sang \"I Was Only 19.\" He also introduced Long Tần veteran Storen as the source for the song. For an SBS TV special \"Vietnam Nurses\" (2005), director Polly Watkins chose \"Redgum and John Schumann's song 'Only Nineteen' during the Welcome Home Parade in 1987 because it is integral to one of the nurses' stories.\" Frank Hunt provides an account of his Vietnam experiences, titled \"I Was Only Nineteen\", in Gina Lennox' book \"Forged by War\" (August 2006).\n\nAfter Schumann had received letters of request from active soldiers in Afghanistan and East Timor he sought permission to visit the troops but obtained no answer. A reporter published an article on the situation, and authorities gave permission for Schumann to tour East Timor in December 2009 and entertain Australian and New Zealand troops. In September–October 2011 he played for Australian troops in Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2015, Lee Kernaghan recorded the song for his album \"Spirit of the Anzacs\". That same year, the song was added to the Sounds of Australia Registry at the National Film & Sound Archive (NFSA).\n\nThe lyrics include words, terms and place names particular to Australia and Vietnam:\n\n\nWhen the song was first released, Rick Melbourne, a breakfast radio announcer, produced a parody version of the song, including the lyrics \"God help me, she told me she was sixteen\". Australian country singer John Williamson recorded a live version as \"Only 19\" and released it on his 1984 vinyl LP, \"The Smell of Gumleaves\" (rereleased in 1996 as a CD under the title \"Home Among the Gum Trees\").\n\nThe song's and album's producer, Trevor Lucas, performed his version as a member of his United Kingdom-based group Fairport Convention at the 1985 Cropredy Festival. On the show \"Fast Forward\", Gina Riley, in character as Eleanor LaGore, performed a swing version of the song.\n\nThe song was covered by Australian Army Band The Lancer Band in 2015 in the lead up to ANZAC Day. The cover gained positive widespread attention in the media. It differed from most covers as it was performed by soldiers and sung by a female soldier.\n\nIn 2005 a hip hop version of the song (called \"I was Only 19\") was produced by The Herd, voted in at #18 in the 2005 Triple J Hottest 100 playlist.\n\nThis song also plays a symbolic role in the 2006 book \"World War Z\" by Max Brooks.\n\n\nSingle version \"I Was Only 19\" (March 1983) – 4:19\nOnly Schumann and McDonald of Redgum played on this track:\n\n\"Caught in the Act\" live version, \"I Was Only 19 (A Walk in the Light Green)\" (1983) – 5:57\nSchumann introduces the song and explains the phrase 'A Walk in the Light Green' which he gives as its title. Recorded at The Rose, Shamrock and Thistle Hotel (aka Three Weeds Hotel) in Rozelle, New South Wales:\n\nJohn Schumann released the song as an acoustic single on iTunes to commemorate 30 years since the song's original release. The single was the version recorded for the 2008 Vagabond Crew album Behind The Lines.\n\n\n", "id": "7739766", "categories": ["Number-one singles in Australia", "Songs of the Vietnam War", "APRA Award winners", "Protest songs", "Anti-war songs", "1983 singles", "Redgum songs", "1983 songs"], "title": "I Was Only 19"}

This extensive site has been redeveloped and many of the old listed hospital buildings have been renovated, including the old hospital water tower, the highest building in the surrounding area, which now serves as an impressive private dwelling.\n\nThe traditional village is served by one shop,3 public houses, a veterinary surgery, an off licence and two churches: St Edward's (Anglican) and St Andrew's (Methodist). The modern development has limited amenities, although there is a Latin American cuisine restaurant situated on the canal side, nearby.\n\nThe village hit the headlines in March 2006 when a fire at a house on Hillside Road killed four people. The cause of the fire was quickly established as arson and eight months later a local man called Mark Goldstraw was found guilty on four counts of murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum term of 35 years.\n\nThe village is twinned with in Germany. The twinning association holds regular meetings and exchanges between the two villages.\n\nAshcombe Park in Cheadle Road is a Grade II listed stately house built by James Trubshaw between 1807 and 1811.\n\nThe 2011 census records a total population for Cheddleton of 5,444 persons and 2,267 households.\n\nHistoric Population Numbers\n\nIn 1563 there were 57 households in Cheddleton. By 1665 this had risen to 154 households. In 1676 the population was 326 people. Since 1801 the national census has recorded the population of the parish every 10 years. The population figures for each of the census returns is detailed below. Parish boundary changes rather than population decline probably account for the fall between 1971 and 2011.\n\nThe parish church of St Edward the Confessor is on Hollow Lane; it is a Grade II* listed building. It was built from the 13th to 15th century.\n\nIn the churchyard are buried Sir Thomas Wardle (1831–1909) and his wife Elizabeth. Thomas Wardle owned a dyeworks in Leek which specialised in silk. He was a friend of the architect George Gilbert Scott, Jr. and of the artist William Morris: in the 1860s there were additions to the church by Scott, and stained-glass windows in the church were created by artists associated with William Morris.\n\nThe cross in the churchyard is an ancient monument. The base is medieval; the upper part is by George Gilbert Scott Jr. and features Instruments of the Passion designed by William Morris.\n\nCheddleton Flint Mill is a Grade II* listed building, situated along the Caldon Canal. It is a prime example of Staffordshire's industrial past – a flint grinding watermill previously used for supplying the pottery industry further along the canal in Stoke-on-Trent. It is open to the public free of charge, and has been preserved, with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund, by the Cheddleton Flint Mill Industrial Heritage Trust.\n\nEvery year there is a carnival organised by the Cheddleton Carnival Committee on the second Saturday in August, held on the Ashcombe Park Cricket Club car park. The committee also organises other events in the village throughout the rest of the year, most notably the Bonfire Night fireworks display – held, again, in the car park, and the 'Duck Race', held annually at the Boat Inn and raced along the canal. The committee raises funds for Cancer Research UK and to date have raised over £750,000.\n\nCheddleton is served by St. Edward's CE (c) First School, close to St. Edward's Church and the local community centre. Children attend the school from the beginning of their education up to Key Stage 2 (Reception class to Year 4). The school has an additional nursery provision and before / after school clubs provided on-site by Early Stages Ltd who also run Teddy's Garden Day nursery from a converted hospital building on St Edwards Park.\n\nThe old schoolhouse has been turned into a well established tea room, just down the road from St. Edward's. On the St Edward's site, the former isolation hospital has been restored and converted into a children's day nursery.\n\nThe North Staffordshire Railway opened its Churnet Valley Railway on 1 September 1849, and opened a railway station at . Closed in 1963, today it is operated as part of a preserved railway.\n\nCheddleton is home to Leek RUFC, who play their home games at Post & Times Park on St. Edward's Park. Cheddleton is also home to Ashcombe Park Cricket Club, who play their home games at Ashcombe Park Cricket Ground at the south end of the village.\n\nThe John Pointon Sports And Recreation Facility was opened at Windy Arbour, Cheddleton on the ground of the old Berresford Bus site.\n\nCheddleton was also home to one of the best loved MotoX tracks in the UK, the steep, mostly natural sand track hosted numerous rounds of various local and national championships.\n\nOver the years many riders who have moved on to race at an international level have competed at Cheddleton including the son of Ron Haslam, current World Superbike rider and former Moto GP rider Leon Haslam.\n\n", "id": "7739815", "categories": ["Staffordshire Moorlands", "Villages in Staffordshire"], "title": "Cheddleton"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739854", "text": "Rusal\n\nUnited Company RUSAL () is the world's second largest aluminium company by primary production output (as of 2016). It was the largest until overtaken by China Hongqiao Group in 2015. UC RUSAL accounts for almost 9% of the world's primary aluminium output and 9% of the world's alumina production.\n\nThe United Company was formed by the merger of RUSAL (Russkiy alyuminiy) (), SUAL, and the alumina assets of Glencore, completed in March 2007. According to its own statistics, UC Rusal accounts for 6.2% of the world's primary aluminium output and 6.5% of the world's alumina production, while operating assets in 13 countries over five continents, employing over 61,000 people across its international operations and offices.\n\nThe company is incorporated in Jersey, where it has its financial centre, but its headquarters are in Moscow, Russian Federation. UC Rusal is a public limited company and its shares are traded on the Moscow Stock Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange and European Stock Exchange.\n\nBy November 2018, Rusal's net income reached $1.54 billions.\n\nRUSAL has played a decisive role in the consolidation of the Russian aluminium industry during its establishment as a large, vertically integrated aluminium holding.\n\nUC Rusal's roots lie in the business activities of Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, who entered the metals industry as a commodities agent and broker at the Moscow Trade Stock Exchange (Moskovskaya Tovarnaya Birzha (MTB)) and then at the Russian Commodities and Raw Materials Exchange (Rossiyskaya Tovarno-Syryevaya Birzha (RTSB)). As a broker, Deripaska dealt in a wide range of commodities, including aluminium. His work also included trading with major Russian aluminium smelters.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1994, companies set up by Mr. Deripaska with the backing of industrialist and entrepreneur Michael Cherney, started investing in the shares of Sayanogorsk Aluminum Smelter (SAZ), one of the newest and most modern aluminium plants built in Soviet times (1980–1985). In 1994, Mr. Deripaska was elected the General Director of SAZ.\n\nIn 1997, the companies controlled by Deripaska underwent a general restructuring, leading to the creation of Sibirsky Aluminium to manage aluminium and alumina assets acquired by Deripaska's companies. By 2000, Sibirsky Aluminium managed, among other aluminium-related assets, majority interests in the Sayanogorsk aluminium smelter, the Sayanal foil mill, a fabricating plant in Samara, Russia, and a minority interest in the Nikolaev alumina refinery in Ukraine.\n\nGradual strategic acquisitions and growth projects eventually led to the creation of one of the world's largest aluminium and alumina producers. Rusal has historically opted to fully integrate its assets under centralized operational and management control. The company has achieved increased production and efficiency in most of its acquired facilities through production “creep” (improvements achieved through targeted improvements to key processes), as well as by undertaking key modernization and expansion projects.\n\nRusal was founded in 2000 after Sibirsky Aluminium and Millhouse Capital, owned by Roman Abramovich, agreed to merge their aluminium and alumina assets.\n\nBy 2002, Sibirsky Aluminium and Millhouse Capital were managing controlling stakes in the Armenal foil mill in Armenia and the Belaya Kalitva metallurgical plant and in Russia, and also took under management the Friguia bauxite and alumina complex and Bauxite of Kindia Company in Guinea to secure bauxite and alumina supply for its Russian smelters. In 2002, Rusal also set up the Engineering and Technology Center in Krasnoyarsk, which is now the foundation of the company's internal R&D projects.\n\nIn 2003, Millhouse Capital sold its 50% stake in Rusal to Basic Element, which held the remaining half of the shares and belongs to Deripaska. In the Ukraine, RUSAL increased its share in the Nikolaev alumina refinery to 98%.\n\nIn 2004, Rusal made the strategic decision to focus on its upstream business and began disposing of its downstream assets, including the sale of its fabricating division to Alcoa in January 2005. The divestiture process was largely completed in 2006 with the distribution of certain aluminium construction plants and other non-core assets to companies controlled by RUSAL's beneficial owner. In 2004, Rusal obtained a licence to develop bauxite mines in Guyana and the Bauxite Company of Guyana was subsequently founded.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, RUSAL acquired several strategically important assets around the globe. In 2004, RUSAL acquired a 90% interest in the Boxitogorsk alumina refinery in Russia and increased its holding in the Nikolaev alumina refinery to 100%.\n\nIn 2005, RUSAL bought a 50% stake in the Komi alumina project from SUAL and became its partner in the project, which involved the construction of an integrated bauxite and alumina complex in Russia's Komi Republic.\n\nAlso in 2005, RUSAL completed the acquisition of a 20% equity interest in one of the world's largest alumina refineries in terms of production capacity, Queensland Alumina Limited, located in Queensland, Australia.\n\nFurthermore, RUSAL purchased assets of a cathode plant in Lingshi County of Shanxi Province, China. In April 2008, the company acquired assets of another cathode plant in Taigu County of Shanxi Province, China, which have been integrated into the existing cathode plant in Lingshi.\n\nIn 2006, RUSAL acquired assets of the state-owned Aroaima Mining Company in Guyana, acquired the remaining equity interest in the Friguia bauxite and alumina complex in Guinea, completed an extensive retrofit of the Armenal foil mill and commissioned the Khakas aluminium smelter in Russia, one of the most advanced aluminium production facilities in the world. RUSAL also acquired a 56.16% equity interest in the Sardinian alumina refinery, Eurallumina.\n\nIn May 2006, RUSAL and RusHydro signed a co-operation agreement for the construction of the Boguchanskaya hydropower station (HPP) and the Boguchansky aluminium smelter. RUSAL increased ownership in the Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk, Sayanogorsk, and Novokuznetsk aluminium smelters, the Achinsk and Boksitogorsk alumina refineries and the Russian National Aluminium and Magnesium Institute (VAMI) to 100% in November 2006, and in Sayanal in June 2007.\n\nIn order to stay competitive, the VAMI and SibVAMI aluminium and magnesium research institutes became the backbone for engineering and technology centres involved in the development of new unique production technologies including RA-300 and RA-400 reduction cells for RUSAL. The new technologies allowed for large-scale greenfield and brownfield projects. In 2005, RUSAL created its own engineering and construction subsidiary, Rusal-Engineering Development Limited, responsible for modernization and construction projects.\n\nIn December 2006, RUSAL acquired through a privatisation process a 77.5% equity interest in the Aluminium Smelter Company of Nigeria (ALSCON). The Group acquired a further 7.5% equity interest in ALSCON from MAN Ferrostaal AG in January 2008.\n\nIn late March 2007, the merger between RUSAL, its domestic competitor SUAL, as well as the bauxite and alumina assets of Swiss commodities trading group Glencore, created UC RUSAL. The merger created the world's largest aluminium company at the time, with assets in 17 countries across five continents, including 16 aluminium smelters, 12 alumina refineries, eight bauxite mines, three powder metallurgy plants, three silicon smelters, three secondary aluminium plants, three aluminium foil mills, two cryolite plants, and one cathode plant. The merger was completed in March 2007, at which time the newly formed company was estimated to have pro-forma sales of $12 billion and production capacity of about four million tonnes of aluminium and 11 million tonnes of alumina. The move completed the 15-year process of consolidating the Russian aluminium industry.\n\nIn November 2007, RUSAL signed a cooperation agreement with Samruk-Energo, a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna, on the creation of a 50/50 joint venture in respect of the operation of the Bogatyr Komir LLP, the largest coal mining company in Kazakhstan, with an annual production of approximately 40 million tonnes of coal, that ensured stable fuel supply to Urals thermal power stations that provide electricity for RUSAL's Urals plants.\n\nIn April 2008, the Group completed the acquisition of a 25% plus one share equity interest of Norilsk Nickel from Onexim, the world's largest nickel and palladium producer. The acquisition allowed the Group to diversify its asset base. The consideration for the shares in Norilsk Nickel was partially paid in cash and partially in shares. The transaction paved the way to develop RUSAL into a global, diversified metals, mining and energy group.\n\nBecause of a string of mergers and acquisitions, particularly that of Norilsk Nickel, UC Rusal had a high level of debt that was exacerbated by the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008. In order to be able to retain its stake in Norilsk Nickel, a strategically important company, and to avoid having to float the stake to foreign lenders, UC Rusal received a $4.5 billion loan from Russian state bank VEB to repay debts to foreign creditors. As part of its debt consolidation efforts in 2009, UC Rusal reduced the costs of its operations by 25%. In December of that same year, a final agreement between the company and 72 Russian and international lenders to refinance $17 billion of debt were reached.\n\nIn January 2009, Oleg Deripaska was appointed Rusal's CEO, replacing Alexander Bulygin, who had held the post for 3 years.\n\nIn January 2010, UC RUSAL was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with its IPO price of HK$10.8 per share and capital raising of US$2.2 billion. The IPO attracted a list of big-name investors including Nathaniel Rothschild, Robert Kuok, Paulson & Co, John Paulson and Vneshekonombank. Rusal is also trading global depostory receipts on the NYSE Euronext in Paris.\n\nAugust 2011 saw Rusal reach an agreement with Sberbank to extend the maturity of debts until 2016, thereby cancelling VEB's loan used to repay debts to lenders.\n\nIn October 2011, UC Rusal announced that it had completed all debt refinancing of outstanding payments worth $11.4 billion. As a result, the company was freed from all investment and dividend payment restrictions, and announced new investments into the modernisation of old smelters and construction of new smelters in Siberia.\n\nWith Chinese aluminium demand growing due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, UC Rusal signed a joint venture agreement with China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) in April 2012. Rusal also signed a memorandum of understanding with one of its main competitors, Shandong Xinfa Group, pertaining to the study of future potential cooperation areas, such as joint ventures.\n\nMarch 2014 saw UC Rusal enter into a 50/50 share joint venture with Israeli automotive component manufacturer Omen High Pressure Die Casting to produce automotive components.\n\nResulting from massive overcapacity in the aluminium market due to China increasing its output of primary aluminium, global aluminium prices fell in the years 2007 to 2013, leading Rusal to report a loss of US$3.2bn in 2014. The company asked creditors to agree to delay payments on part of its US$10bn net debt pile. In August that year, national and international lenders agreed to allow the restructuring of its debt.\n\nIn November 2014, Vladislav Solovyov was appointed as Rusal's CEO, while Deripaska assumed the role of company president.\n\nIn 2016, UC Rusal signed another joint venture agreement with a Chinese firm, Hebei Joy Sense Cable Co. (HJSC), to produce aluminium cable for electrical applications.\n\nIn 2017, Rusal issued two Eurobonds to finance its debts. The first one, worth US$600 million, was issued in February, followed by a second one in April, worth US$500 million. Also in February, plans were announced to sell 10 billion yuan worth of seven-year onshore bonds to finance purchases in China, making Rusal the first foreign company to offer panda bonds on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The company also agreed on a pre-export finance mechanism with international lenders worth US$1.7 billion for debt refinancing.\n\nIn April 2017, Rusal signed a joint venture with Indian firm Runaya Metsource for producing aluminum paste and powder, with commercial activities set to commence in 2018.\n\nAs of 2016, UC Rusal's biggest shareholders are En+ Group with a controlling stake of 48.13%, along with Onexim Group (13.7%) and SUAL (15,80 %). 8.75% is owned by Amokenga Holdings, Toni Shterev owns 00.1% of the shares Rusal.a wholly owned subsidiary of Glencore. The remaining 13.37% account for the public float, and shareholding by the company management (0.25%).\n\nIt was announced on August 11 that Onexim agreed to sell 7% of its Rusal stake to SUAL. In February, Onexim had already sold 3.3% to SUAL. Once the sale is approved, Onexim will retain a 6.7% stake in Rusal, while SUAL's will increase to 22.80%.\n\nAs of the end of 2016, UC Rusal owned 12 aluminium smelters, 10 alumina refineries, 7 bauxite mines worldwide, and 4 domestic foil rolling mills.\n\nRusal owns and operates six aluminium smelters, two alumina refineries and two foil rolling mills in Russia:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions against Oleg Deripaska and his business enterprises, including Rusal, along with 23 other Russian nationals and entities in their control, according to \"Reuters\", \"to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other 'malign activity.'\" The United States Department of the Treasury issued a statement declaring that Deripaska \"has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering.\" Further stated were allegations that Deripaska had ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group. On April 23, however, the US government gave Rusal America Corporation, a subsidiary, customers \"more time to comply with sanctions\", even saying it would \"consider lifting them if United Company Rusal Plc’s major shareholder, Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, ceded control of the company.\" Department of the Treasury gave these clients until October 23, 2018 to comply with (wind down business) the Rusal sanctions.\n\nIn May 2018, the company announced the resignation of its CEO Alexandra Bouriko and seven board members in order to avoid U.S. sanctions against Oleg Deripaska.\n\nIn January 2019, the U.S. lifted sanctions after Deripaska reduced his stake in the company to less that 50% snd his voting rights to less than 35%. US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell among others argued that this would maintain pressure on Deripaska without disrupting aluminum markets. In April 2019 the company announced a project in Ashland, Kentucky that would produce \"flat-rolled aluminum products for the US automotive industry. McConnell represents Kentucky.\n\nAccording to media reports, UC Rusal seeks to cover all the energy required to power its aluminium smelters via clean energy by 2020, particularly using hydropower. The company's current energy mix includes 90% renewables. The announcement was in line with UC Rusal's pledge to support the sustainable production of aluminium upon joining the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) in 2015.\n\nAs a response to increased demand for sustainably produced aluminium from major downstream industries – particularly the motor, packaging and electronics sectors – Rusal introduced a low-carbon aluminium brand in November 2017, called Allow. According to industry publications, the brand includes an independently verified low-carbon certification program meant to guarantee a maximum carbon footprint of four tones of CO2 per ton of aluminium produced. This puts it below the industry's average, which is currently estimated to be at 12t per ton of metal produced. According to a Reuters report, Allow covers roughly 80 percent of Rusal's total output.\n\nRusal's president, Oleg Deripaska, has in the past expressed support for introducing steep carbon taxation in order to force other firms away from using coal power and reduce the industry's carbon footprint.\n\nFollowing the 2011 Toho earthquake and tsunami, UC Rusal donated $600,000 to Japanese children's and cultural heritage foundations. These included the Ashinaga Foundation providing financial and educational support to children; the Yul Foundation supporting the learning process and psychological rehabilitation of pupils; and donations to the Ishinomori Mangattan Museum in Miyagi Prefecture for the city's reconstruction of cultural attractions.\n\nIn 2012, Rusal donated 25 tonnes of medical supplies to Sierra Leone to control the outbreak of cholera in the country as part of its commitment to corporate social responsibility.\n\nIn cooperation with Alscon, Rusal commissioned the construction of 14 fresh water facilities in Nigeria so as to provide potable water to over 10,000 people in the Ikot Abasi region.\n\nDuring the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, UC Rusal provided logistical support to the international relief efforts. In 2015, the company invested $10 million to build the “Centre for epidemic and microbiological research and treatment” in Guinea to fight the spread of the virus. It also donated medication, as well as sanitary equipment to the Guinean Health Ministry, and was involved in setting up a mobile hospital containing 200 beds. Field trials for a Russian Ebola vaccine were carried out at the Centre, and the vaccine was officially launched in August 2017 in Kindia, where the Centre is located.\n\n\n", "id": "7739854", "categories": ["Companies listed on the Moscow Exchange", "Rusal", "Basic Element (company)", "Russian companies established in 2007", "Economy of Jersey", "Russian brands", "Companies based in Moscow", "Companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange", "Aluminium companies of Russia"], "title": "Rusal"}

It operated local service in Queens and express service to Manhattan until January 9, 2006, when the city-operated MTA Bus Company took over its routes. It was managed most recently by the late Mr. Jerome Cooper (August 14, 1928 – May 20, 2015, aged 86).\n\nGreen Bus Lines routes primarily operated in the Jamaica, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, South Jamaica, and the Rockaway's area of Queens, along with service to the passenger and cargo areas of John F. Kennedy International Airport. At the time of its closure, Green Lines operated more local and limited bus routes than any other private company in the city.\n\nStockholders of Green Bus Lines also held control of other private bus companies in Queens and Brooklyn as Transit Alliance. These companies were Triboro Coach, Jamaica Buses, and Command Bus Company, all of which were absorbed into the MTA Regional Bus operations. The company reorganized as GTJ Reit Inc., a real estate investment trust, shortly after MTA takeover.\n\nThe company was incorporated on April 3, 1925 by William Cooper (1895-1985, aged 90) to provide local service in several boroughs. Cooper originally began operating a single bus line, a portion of today's Q8 101-Jerome Avenue route in 1922. The company was formed from several independently-operated bus lines, whose owners operated the buses, and would become stockholders and employees in Green Lines.\n\nThe company acquired several Manhattan routes (including the current M22, M50, M79, M86, and M96) in 1933, but these were transferred to the Comprehensive Omnibus Corporation in 1935 and New York City Omnibus Corporation in 1936. That year, Green Lines took over the operations of Liberty Bus, and the borough's bus system was divided into four lettered \"zones\", with each zone being served exclusively by one bus company. Green Lines was awarded the rights to all of \"Zone C\" in southern Queens, which included Woodhaven, Richmond Hill, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, and the Rockaways. With that move, Green Lines assumed the operations of seven other companies in the region. Green also acquired the Manhattan and Queens Bus Corporation, which had operated the ex-Manhattan and Queens Traction Company Queens Boulevard Line into Manhattan (the ) since 1937, in 1943.\n\nGreen stockholders acquired two other transit companies that continued to operate independently: Triboro Coach Corporation in October 1947, and Jamaica Buses in April 1949. Jointly these three companies formed Command Bus Company in 1979 to take over the routes that had been previously operated by Pioneer Bus Corporation, which went out of the transit bus business following a bitter strike earlier in 1979.\n\nThe QM23 was started in the 1950s to replace Long Island Rail Road service to the Brooklyn Manor station on the Rockaway Beach Branch. It was discontinued in 2010. Four more express routes began operation in the 1970s.\n\nGreen Bus Lines, Inc.; Triboro Coach Corporation; and Jamaica-Central Railways, Inc. were each owned by individual shareholders. Jamaica-Central Railways, Inc. had a wholly owned subsidiary, Jamaica Buses, Inc. Several subsidiary corporations were owned 40 percent by Green Bus Lines, Inc.; 40 percent by Triboro Coach Corporation; and 20 percent by Jamaica-Central Railways, Inc. These jointly owned subsidiary corporations included Command Bus Company, Inc., and G.T.J. Co., Inc. (originally Varsity Transit, Inc.). Among the wholly owned subsidiaries of G.T.J. Co., Inc. was Transit Facility Management Corp., which provided Access-A-Ride paratransit service using the name TFM Paratransit; Varsity Transit, Inc. (originally Varsity Coach Corp. until 1989), which provided school bus service within the City of New York; and Varsity Coach Corp. (incorporated 1989), which provided school bus service outside the City of New York.\n\nOn June 23, 2006, GTJ REIT, Inc. was formed under the laws of Maryland as a real estate investment trust. Two weeks later, on July 7, 2006, three wholly owned subsidies of GTJ REIT, Inc. were formed: Green Acquisition, Inc.; Triboro Acquisition, Inc.; and Jamaica Acquisition, Inc.\n\nA special meeting of the shareholders of Green Bus Lines, Inc.; Triboro Coach Corporation; and Jamaica-Central Railways, Inc. was held on March 26, 2007 for the purpose of obtaining the consent of a majority of the shareholders of each company to be merged into the GTJ REIT, Inc. subsidiaries. A majority of shareholders of each company voted in favor, and on March 29, 2007 Green Bus Lines, Inc. was merged into Green Acquisition, Inc.; Triboro Coach Corporation was merged into Triboro Acquisition, Inc.; and Jamaica-Central Railways, Inc. was merged into Jamaica Acquisition, Inc. Shareholders exchanged their old shares in the bus companies for new shares in GTJ REIT, Inc. Command Bus Company, Inc. and Varsity Coach Corp. were both dissolved on January 21, 2010. Jamaica Buses, Inc. was dissolved on May 13, 2010.\n\nDuring 2011 and 2012, the Company underwent a process of shedding all businesses and assets that were no longer compatible with its real estate focus.\n\nIn January 2013, the Company closed on a transaction with a privately held joint venture in which the Company acquired ownership interests in a portfolio of 25 commercial properties located in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. As a result of subsequent acquisitions, the company owns 45 properties, approximately 5 million square feet and 338 acres of land.\n\nGTJ REIT, Inc. is headquartered in West Hempstead, N.Y. Its portfolio of real estate investments includes the four garages once used for transit bus operations, all of which (Baisley Park Depot, Far Rockaway Depot's older building only. New annex owned by MTA/NYCTA, JFK Depot, and LaGuardia Depot) are leased to the City of New York for use as bus garages by MTA Bus Company.\n\nOn May 20, 2015, Jerome Cooper, the president and chairman of GTJ, REIT, Inc. died at age 86 of sudden cardiac arrest (heart failure) at his home at Long Beach, New York.\n\nJust prior to MTA Bus takeover, Green Bus lines operated the following routes, which mostly continued to be based in Far Rockaway Bus Depot and John F. Kennedy Bus Depot. Hubs for Green Lines operations included 165th Street Bus Terminal in Jamaica, the Mott Avenue subway station in Far Rockaway, and several stations in the IND Queens Boulevard Line.\n\nGreen Bus Lines' first southeast Queens depot (also known as Cornell Park) was located at 149th Street and 147th Avenue (148-02 147th Avenue) in what was then South Ozone Park, Queens. The facility, which contained an office building and a bus garage, opened in May 1939 at a cost of $250,000. This area has since been de-mapped and is now on the grounds of John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\nGreen Lines' second southeast Queens garage was located in Jamaica at 147th Avenue and Rockaway Boulevard (165-25 147th Avenue) near JFK Airport. The depot was built from 1951 to 1952 at the cost of $500,000. It was the primary storage and maintenance facility for the company. It is now the John F. Kennedy Depot (or JFK Depot) of MTA Bus.\n\nGreen Lines operated a facility on the Rockaway Peninsula, situated on Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 49th Street (49-19 Rockaway Beach Boulevard) in the neighborhood of Arverne. It was sometimes referred to as the \"Rockaway Garage\". A satellite facility, it primarily housed buses serving the Rockaways and southern Queens, performing light maintenance work. It is now MTA Bus' Far Rockaway Depot.\n", "id": "7739857", "categories": ["1925 establishments in New York (state)", "Bus transportation in New York City", "Transport companies established in 1925", "Transport companies disestablished in 2006"], "title": "Green Bus Lines"}

He started playing rugby at The King's Hospital school, Dublin when he was ten years old. After studying at Trinity College, he was ordained a deacon in the Church of Ireland in 1953, and priest in 1954. He joined Lansdowne rugby football club for the 1953-54 season. he served a curacy at Sandford, Dublin in the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough from 1953 to 1955.\n\nRoe was first selected to play for the Barbarians while studying at Trinity College in 1951. He played in a total of eleven matches for the Barbarians and scored two tries. From 1952 to 1957 Roe played in twenty-one matches for 's national rugby team as hooker.\n\nIn 1955 Roe toured with the British and Irish Lions in South Africa, where he played approximately a dozen games (two as prop) and scored a try against Griqualand West. After injuring his ribs early in the tour, his appearances were limited but he still played when required. The tour lasted four months, and Roe's roommates were the 19-year-old Tony O'Reilly, Bill Williams and Bryn Meredith. Roe found the rugby in South Africa more demanding than he was accustomed to in Ireland, and he admired the consistent play of O'Reilly. He disliked South Africa's apartheid system as opposed to his beliefs as a priest. Roe's twenty-inch neck brought some ribbing from his teammates. The Catholics on the team joked that he had a great neck for a Roman collar.\n\nIn 1955 as an army chaplain based near London, he played about fifteen games for London Irish. Roe thought that Sunbury, the home base of the London Irish, was enjoyable; while the training at London Irish was rigorous, Roe believed that the team at Lansdowne was more settled. Roe regarded fellow hooker Karl Mullen, the man he replaced in the Ireland number 2 jersey and the captain of Ireland and the 1950 British and Irish Lions, as his toughest opponent.\n\nIn the summer of 1957 Roe was a member of the first Barbarians side to tour outside Britain or Ireland. The team's tour of Canada was a success, with a 6–0 won-lost record and a 227–23 points for-against ratio.\n\nRoe joined the British Army in 1955, when he was commissioned (on a Short Service Commission) into the Royal Army Chaplains' Department as a Chaplain to the Forces 4th Class (equivalent to a captain in all other units, chaplains are traditionally addressed as padre regardless of rank). He switched to a full commission in 1958, and was promoted to Chaplain to the Forces 3rd Class (equivalent to a major) in 1961.\nRoe distinguished himself for bravery while serving as a British Army chaplain attached to the 1st battalion, Lancashire Regiment in Aden in 1967. During the Arab police mutiny (part of the Aden Emergency), Roe heard gunfire and left Radfan Camp to investigate. He found a British Army lorry on fire with a number of British soldiers lying dead and wounded. Under heavy fire Roe helped the wounded soldiers to safety in Radfan Camp. Roe was unarmed, as is the custom for military chaplains. He only left the scene after being forcibly turned back by another officer, after he had been shot at and his personal Land Rover struck by machine gun fire. He was awarded the Military Cross for his courage under fire, the award was gazetted on 19 January 1968.\n\nHe was promoted to Chaplain to the Forces 2nd Class (lieutenant-colonel) in 1969, and to 1st Class (colonel) in 1973. In 1977 he was made an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen. He retired from the Army in 1982, and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his work as a chaplain in that year's Queen's Birthday Honours.\n\nRoe became Rector of Merrow, Surrey (Diocese of Guildford) in 1982 and served there until his retirement in 1989. He then moved to Shalford, Surrey and continued to take services within the diocese. He died on 15 July 2010.\n\n", "id": "7739862", "categories": ["2010 deaths", "People educated at The King's Hospital", "1928 births", "Rugby union players from County Laois", "Lansdowne Football Club players", "Ireland international rugby union players", "Alumni of Trinity College Dublin", "Barbarian F.C. players", "British and Irish Lions rugby union players from Ireland", "Commanders of the Order of the British Empire", "Recipients of the Military Cross", "Church of Ireland priests", "British military personnel of the Aden Emergency", "Royal Army Chaplains' Department officers"], "title": "Robin Roe"}

She participated in the Greco-Italian War in 1940–1941, escorting convoys and unsuccessfully attacking Italian shipping in the Adriatic Sea. After the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, the ship escorted convoys between Egypt and Greece until she evacuated part of the government to Crete later that month and then to Egypt in May. After the Greek surrender on 1 June, \"Vasilissa Olga\" served with British forces for the rest of her career. \n\nShe escorted convoys in the Eastern Mediterranean for the next several months before she was sent to India for a refit. The ship resumed convoy escort duties upon its completion at the beginning of 1942 in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. In December of that year, now operating in the Central Mediterranean, \"Vasilissa Olga\" and a British destroyer briefly captured an Italian submarine, but it sank while under tow. The following month, the ship, together with a pair of British destroyers, sank a small Italian transport ship. She was briefly tasked to escort an Australian troop convoy in the Red Sea in February 1943 before returning to the Mediterranean. Together with a British destroyer, \"Vasilissa Olga\" sank at least two ships from an Italian convoy in June. Over the next several months, she escorted British ships as the Allies invaded Sicily (Operation Husky)and mainland Italy (Operation Avalanche).\n\nThe ship was transferred back to the Eastern Mediterranean in September to participate in the Dodecanese Campaign. Together with two British destroyers, she helped to destroy a small German convoy in the islands before beginning to ferry troops and supplies to the small British garrison on the island of Leros. After completing one such mission, she was sunk by German bombers in Lakki harbor on 26 September with the loss of 72 men.\n\nThe \"Vasilefs Georgios\"-class ships were derived from the British G-class destroyers, modified with German guns and fire-control systems. They had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Parsons geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers for a designed speed of . During her sea trials on 19 December 1938, \"Vasilissa Olga\" reached a speed of from , although her armament was not yet installed. The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave a range of at . Their crew consisted of 162 officers and crewmen. Unlike her sister ship , \"Vasilissa Olga\" was not fitted out to accommodate an admiral and his staff.\n\nThe ships carried four SK C/34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, designated 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y', from front to rear, one pair each superfiring forward and aft of the superstructure. Her anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of four guns in four single mounts amidships and two quadruple mounts for Vickers AA machineguns. The \"Vasilefs Georgios\" class carried eight above-water torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts. They had two depth charge launchers and a single rack for their 17 depth charges.\n\nDuring her late 1941 refit in Calcutta, India, \"Vasilissa Olga\"s armament was revised to better suit her role as a convoy escort. The rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a AA gun and 'Y' gun was removed to increase the number of depth charge throwers and depth charge stowage. To reduce topweight, the 3.7 cm guns were replaced by Oerlikon autocannon. Her mainmast was removed and her aft funnel shortened to improve the arcs of fire of her AA guns. The ship was fitted with a Type 128 asdic to improve her ability to detect submarines.\n\nThe \"Vasilefs Georgios\"-class ships were ordered on 29 January 1937 as part of a naval rearmament plan that was intended to include one light cruiser and at least four destroyers, one pair of which were to be built in Britain and the other pair in Greece. \"Vasilissa Olga\" was laid down at Yarrow & Company's shipyard in Scotstoun, Scotland in February 1937, launched on 2 June 1938, and commissioned on 4 February 1939 without her armament, which was installed later in Greece.\n\nAfter the sank the elderly protected cruiser in a sneak attack on 15 August 1940 off the island of Tinos, \"Vasilissa Olga\" and her sister were sent to Tinos to escort the merchant ships there home. During the Greco-Italian War she escorted convoys and participated in raids against Italian lines of communication in the Strait of Otranto on the nights of 14/15 November 1940 and 4/5 January 1941 that failed to locate any ships. The sisters ferried the Greek gold reserves to Crete on 1 March.\n\nAfter the German invasion of Greece on 6 April, the sisters began to escort convoys between Greece and Egypt via Crete. On 22 April, \"Vasilissa Olga\" was ordered to evacuate elements of the Greek government to Crete, including Vice Admiral Alexandros Sakellariou who was the Minister for Naval Affairs, Chief of the Navy General Staff and Deputy Prime Minister. The following month she proceeded to Alexandria, Egypt, and then escorted convoys in the Eastern Mediterranean before departing for India to be modernized on 9 October.\n\nThe refit was completed on 5 January 1942 and the ship escorted convoys in the Arabian and Red Seas before arriving back in Alexandria on 22 February. Together with the British destroyer , \"Vasilissa Olga\" was escorting the oil tanker RFA \"Slavol\" off Mersa Matruh, Egypt, when they detected and unsuccessfully attacked the on 26 March. Later that day, the submarine sank both \"Jaguar\" and \"Slavol\". \"Vasilissa Olga\" ran aground in early May while escorting a convoy between Alexandria and Tobruk and damaged her propellers.

From 1970 to 1974 he played for Vanderbilt University, and in 1974 he led the Commodores to a Southeastern Conference championship as SEC Player of the Year.\n\nHe also spent two years in Italy, from 1983 to 1985, helping Italian team Virtus Bologna win a championship.\n\nVan Breda Kolff's tenure at St. Bonaventure ended abruptly in controversy late in the 2002–03 season. St. Bonaventure declared junior college transfer Jamil Terrell eligible to play without sitting out a year (as he would have been under NCAA rules if he had earned an associate degree), even though Terrell had only earned a welding certificate. Athletic director Gothard Lane had told school president Robert Wickenheiser that Terrell was ineligible to play that year. However, Wickenheiser, under prodding from his son Kort, who was also one of Van Breda Kolff's assistants, unilaterally declared Terrell eligible. School officials didn't seek guidance from the NCAA about Terrell's eligibility until the 2002–03 season was nearly over. The Bonnies were forced to forfeit every game in which Terrell played, and were also barred from the Atlantic 10 Conference tournament. In protest, the Bonnies players opted to sit out the last two games. Van Breda Kolff denied knowing about the scandal, and was cleared of wrongdoing.\n\nOn April 25, 2007, he was named as one of three finalists to become the new head coach of UC Riverside's men's basketball program.\n\nVan Breda Kolff was named coach of the Nashville Broncos of the American Basketball Association in 2008.

He was the Duke of Zvenigorod and Galich from 1389 until his death. During the reign of his brother Vasily I, he took part in the campaigns against Torzhok (1392), Zhukotin (1414), and Novgorod (1417). He was the chief orchestrator of the Muscovite Civil War against his nephew, Vasily II, in the course of which he twice took Moscow, in 1433 and 1434.\n\nBy his wife, Anastasia, the daughter of Yury of Smolensk, Yury had three sons — Vasily Kosoy, Dmitry Shemyaka, and Dmitry Krasny. The marriage to Anastasia made him the brother-in-law of Švitrigaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania.\n\nAt his father's death, Yury received in appanage the towns of Zvenigorod, Ruza, and Galich.\n\nUpon his brother's death, Yury immediately asserted his claim to the throne of Muscovy against that of Vasily's son, Vasily II. He referenced the old house law of the House of Rurik, whereby the senior throne in the dynasty passed from brother to brother, rather than from father to son. He also interpreted in his favour the testament of Dmitri Donskoi, written at the time when Vasily had been unmarried and childless.\n\nIn 1430, Yury and his nephew decided that the issue would be settled in the Golden Horde. The Khan supported the claim of Vasily II, but allowed Yury to take the appanage of his deceased younger brother, Peter of Dmitrov. This decision did not fully satisfy Vasily, who took Dmitrov by force and expelled Yury's governor from the town in 1432. In response, Yury rallied his forces and advanced on Pereslavl-Zalessky. Vasily II was defeated on the bank of the Klyazma River and fled to Kostroma. After that, Yury entered Moscow in triumph and proclaimed himself Grand Duke.\n\nInstead of imprisoning his nephew, Yury allowed him to settle in Kolomna and rule the town as his appanage. This show of magnanimity cost him dearly, as scores of Muscovite boyars and noblemen fled to Vasily's court in Kolomna. This shift in momentum impelled Yury to conclude a treaty with Vasily, whereby the uncle renounced his claims to Moscow, promised to deny assistance to his sons, and exchanged Dmitrov for other territories. Vasily returned to Moscow, while Yury withdrew to Galich.\n\nThe following year, Kosoy and Shemyaka defeated Vasily II on the banks of the Kus River. The grand prince was informed that Yury's troops had been seen among his enemies and decided to punish him for this treachery. In winter 1434, he set Galich ablaze, but Yury had escaped northward to Belozersk. On 16 March, the armies of the uncle and the nephew clashed between Rostov and Pereslavl. Vasily's army was roundly defeated and he sought refuge in Nizhny Novgorod.\n\nOn 31 March 1434, on the Bright Week Wednesday, Yury again entered Moscow, where he captured Vasily's family and treasury. He was preparing a new campaign against Vasily when he died suddenly, on 5 July 1434, succeeded by his eldest son, Vasily Kosoy.\n\n", "id": "7739932", "categories": ["Grand Princes of Moscow", "14th-century military personnel", "Rurik dynasty", "People from Pereslavl-Zalessky", "15th-century Grand Princes of Moscow", "1374 births", "1434 deaths", "Medieval Russian military personnel", "Rurikids", "14th-century Russian people", "15th-century Russian people"], "title": "Yury of Zvenigorod"}

The system is hierarchical, with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels. The top division is organized by Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the second and third levels by entity associations, and lower levels by cantonal or regional associations.\n\nThe Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina is at the top of the structure. It is the top flight in Bosnian club football and has 16 teams. The League champion is also the champion of Bosnia and Herzegovina and has the right to play in the UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds. The bottom two teams of the table are relegated to the second level of competition.\n\nThe second tier is divided into two leagues – the First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the First League of Republika Srpska – containing, respectively, 16 and 12 clubs. Relegated teams from the Premier League are demoted to the second-level competition in the next season. Geographical location is the criterion for decided decision in which one of these two leagues the teams will play. The winner of each league is promoted to the Premier League, and bottom teams are relegated. The number of relegated teams depends on how many teams enter from the Premier League and the Third Divisions.\n\nThird-level football is even more dispersed. Each league is associated with a different geographical area. In Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are four second divisions, and in Republika Srpska two second divisions. Same principle of promotion and relegation is used, so the league winners are promoted to the appropriate second-level league, and clubs at the bottom of the table are relegated to lower levels.\n\nThere are cantonal football associations in nine of the ten cantons which make up the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They each organize clubs into one or more leagues, depending on the number of clubs they control. In Republika Srpska, which has no cantons, there are instead four football regions, each of which has a league. The first leagues in the Federation cantons and the regional leagues in Republika Srpska constitute the fourth level of club football.\n\nFurther down, there are many different types of organization. Some cantons (with a large number of clubs) have second leagues, and there are also municipality and inter-municipality leagues for clubs not associated with any cantonal or regional league.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup usually starts in spring with qualification matches. Those matches are played between lower league clubs on canton (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) or region (Republika Srpska) level. Best teams qualify to entity cups which are qualifying competitions for national cup.\n\nIn the first round of national cup, 12 Premier League teams are joined by 12 teams from Federation and 8 teams from Republika Srpska.

The road is designated Massachusetts Routes 2 (northbound) and 16 (eastbound), and US Route 3 (northbound). The parkway runs roughly north, skirting just east of the Alewife T station to a large intersection (formerly a rotary), where the limited access highway carrying Route 2 to the west begins. The parkway runs north from this intersection, paralleling just east of the course of Alewife Brook, which forms the western boundary of Cambridge with Arlington. The first major intersection is with Massachusetts Avenue, which carries Massachusetts Route 2A eastward toward Porter Square, and Routes 2A and 3 westward into Arlington. The parkway continues to parallel Alewife Brook as it heads north into Somerville. After crossing Broadway, the parkway passes through a rotary-like interchange with Powder House Boulevard. It then passes Dilboy Stadium, on the left, and reaches its northern terminus at a small rotary near where Alewife Brook empties into the Mystic River. There it meets the Mystic Valley Parkway, which runs from Arlington just to the west to Medford to the northeast. The Route 16 designation continues northeast. The parkway's total length is just over two miles (about three kilometers).\n\nThe parkway, with the surrounding Alewife Brook Reservation (), forms part of Boston's Metropolitan Park District, established in 1893. It was originally planned by landscape architect Charles Eliot as one section of a web of pleasure roads designed for their aesthetics. Nearby Alewife Brook was straightened and channelized between 1909 and 1912, and construction of the parkway was completed by 1916. Landscaping was performed by the famed Olmsted Brothers firm. Route 2 connected to Alewife Brook Parkway as a highway in the present right-of-way at some point before 1937.\n\nA drive-in theatre was built in 1950, replaced by the Fresh Pond Shopping Center in 1962. The current indoor movie theatre next to the shopping center was added in 1964.\n\nAlong the southern end, Alewife Brook Parkway underwent further changes beginning in the late 1980s, including a new four lane causeway overpass spanning the Fitchburg line of the Commuter rail, new dedicated shoulder turning-lanes for exiting and entering the shopping centers, enlarged roundabouts with obstructive center trees removed, new raised grassy medians down the center of the parkway, and new trees, light poles, and bike lanes integrated into the sidewalks. Some of the other amenities integrated in the new design include handicap ramps and stairs on the northbound side of the bridge leading to the Rindge Towers, new sidewalk access leading to the Alewife T station, Alewife Linear Park, bike trail adjacent to Jerry's Pond, and a dedicated road for large trucks to service the shopping areas by passing below the overpass.\n\nAs traffic has grown over the past century, the original aesthetics of the parkway's southernmost sections have been largely lost. It is now the principal connector between Route 2 and the western suburbs, on the one hand, and downtown Cambridge and Boston on the other, and consequently carries a large volume of commuter traffic. The Alewife MBTA station is a prominent feature on the parkway, and there are shopping centers, parking lots, and office and apartment buildings lining the parkway between Alewife station and the southern terminus.\n\nIn February 2010, CBS-television affiliate WBZ questioned whether the remaining 118 rotaries such as the ones featured at Alewife Brook Parkway and Fresh Pond Parkway should be scrapped across Massachusetts.\n\n\n", "id": "7740026", "categories": ["National Register of Historic Places in Somerville, Massachusetts", "Streets in Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts", "Transportation in Somerville, Massachusetts", "National Register of Historic Places in Cambridge, Massachusetts", "U.S. Route 3", "Parkways in Massachusetts"], "title": "Alewife Brook Parkway"}

Based at Scottish Enterprise, the £1 billion venture aims to create an attractive inward investment location for leading international financial services companies and a re-location option for existing Glasgow-based companies, seeking to expand their operations.\n\nPrior to the launch of the IFSD in 2001, the long-term decline of the old Port of Glasgow and its associated wharves and warehousing had resulted in a neglected infrastructure in Glasgow's city centre area fronting the River Clyde, otherwise known as the Broomielaw. The result was a small number of isolated modern offices, standing adjacent to derelict land and vacant dilapidated buildings, loosely connected to Glasgow's traditional core business district centred on Blythswood Square at the western end of the city centre.\n\nPlanning led by Scottish Enterprise and Glasgow City Council, aimed to create a new, dynamic focus for the area’s regeneration, through the establishment of the IFSD. This was an important development of Glasgow’s financial services sector, which, with 28,000 employees, was recognised as vital to the city’s economic fortunes. In order to develop a fully serviced financial services district and exploit its long term potential, significant investment was required to create the right environment.\n\nNo official boundary of the IFSD exists; notionally the term refers to the approximately 1 square kilometer area of the city centre bounded by the M8 motorway to the west, the River Clyde the south, Hope Street to the east, and Sauchiehall Street to the north - taking in most of Blythswood Hill, the south eastern fringe of Anderston and part of Charing Cross. This has given rise to the area's nicknames in the popular press: the \"Square Kilometre\" (in reference to the \"square mile\" of the City of London), and more the popular and widely used \"Wall Street On Clyde\".\n\nSince the start of the project, over 15,000 jobs have been created in the area, with several of the world's leading financial companies having a presence in the district.\n\nA constant stream of new buildings has appeared in the IFSD since 2001, with more in the pipeline. The Aurora building in the IFSD for example has won several UK wide awards as large scale speculative office building.\n\nThe IFSD is connected by five railway stations, with routes that reach regionally and nationally.\n\n\nThe IFSD is well connected with two Glasgow Subway stations.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740140", "text": "Citizens (Spanish political party)\n\nCitizens ( ; ; ; ; shortened as Cs—C's until January 2017), officially Citizens–Party of the Citizenry (\"Ciudadanos–Partido de la Ciudadanía\"), is a centre to centre-right political party in Spain.\n\nOriginating in Catalonia in 2006, the party received 25.4% of votes and 36 deputies in the December 2017 Catalan regional election, making it the largest single party in the Parliament of Catalonia. Nevertheless, it has never taken power so their actual political stance remains a source of controversy between supporters and adversaries beyond their strong opposition to Catalan nationalism, of which there is no disputation. The party used the phrase \"Catalonia is my homeland, Spain is my country and Europe is our future\" to outline the party's ideology which the party self-describes as postnationalist. In spite of that, it has deemed by a variety of sources to profess a populist Spanish nationalist ideology.\n\nCitizens used to present itself as a centre-left party that offered a mix of social-democratic and liberal-progressive positions on its platform, but it dropped any mention to social democracy from its principles in February 2017 and by 2018 and 2019 is reported to have experienced a further swing to the right as it began to compete with the PP and later also with Vox to become the leading right-of-centre party in the country. It has recently been described by media and CIS (a Spanish public research institute) as right-oriented. A core topic of its platform is opposition to Catalan nationalism.\n\nCitizens was formed in Catalonia in July 2006 in response to the call made in a manifesto by a group of well-known figures in Catalan civic society (among them Albert Boadella, Félix de Azúa, Francesc de Carreras and Arcadi Espada) in which they called for a new political force to \"address the real problems faced by the general public\". In this manifesto, they also warned that \"the rhetoric of hatred promulgated by official Catalan government media against everything Spanish is more alarming than ever\" and that \"the (Catalan) nation, promoted as an homogenous entity, has taken over the space where an undeniably diverse society lived\".\n\nIn July 2005, this group of personalities, almost entirely based in Barcelona, formed a political platform called \"Ciutadans de Catalunya\", or Citizens of Catalonia. They organised several round tables and conferences and by 2006 they had announced the formation of a new political party. In their first conference of 2006, Albert Rivera, a young lawyer from Barcelona, was elected president.\n\nIn the 2006 elections for the Parliament of Catalonia, Cs won 3% of the votes and returned three MPs. In the 2010 elections, a similar result was achieved (3.4%, 3 MPs). Mainly as a counter to the growing public support for independence in Catalonia, Cs has since further grown substantially in support as one of the most outspoken opponents of this movement. In the 2012 snap elections, the number of votes more than doubled (7.6%, 9 MPs). All but one of these seats were in the Province of Barcelona. In the 2015 elections, Cs more than doubled its votes again (17.9%, 25 MPs), becoming the second largest faction in the Catalan parliament.\n\nIn 2013, the party started organising in the rest of Spain with a manifesto called \"La conjura de Goya\" (\"Confederacy of Goya\") that took place in the Congress Palace of Madrid. In the 2015 general elections, Cs entered parliament with 13.9% and 40 seats. As PP's Mariano Rajoy refused the mandate to form a government, Cs promised the second-largest party PSOE support in parliament in exchange for a number of political concessions. However, this pact would have needed the support of Podemos and finally did not gain a parliamentarian majority, paving the way for a repeat election. In the 2016 snap elections, Cs lost 0.8% of the popular vote and 8 seats due to Spain's electoral system. After these elections, Cs could strike a deal with the conservative PP in supporting its government in exchange for a number of political concessions. After a 10-month political deadlock, PP leader Mariano Rajoy was able to become Prime Minister thanks to Cs support and an abstention of PSOE.\n\nIn the 2014 European elections, the party received 3.16% of the national vote and elected two MEPs. Both MEPs joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) group.\n\nThe party was accepted into the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party on 4 June 2016.\n\nAt first, Citizens branded itself as a centre-left party in its statement of principles (\"ideario\"). While Rivera refused to locate Citizens on the political spectrum for a time, he has recently been placing Cs in the political centre. Although some observers agreed with the party's \"ideario\" by describing Cs as centre-left and others agree with Rivera's last definition by describing the party as centrist, the vast majority of them have positioned Citizens on the centre-right. In a 2014 interview, Congress spokesman Juan Carlos Girauta explicitly stated that he did not perceive any significant differences between Citizens, the centrist Union, Progress and Democracy and the far-right Spanish nationalist party Vox.\n\nIdeologically, Cs describes itself as a progressive, secular, constitutional, European federalist and postnationalist political party. Ciudadanos rejects the autonomous communities' right to self-determination outside of the Spanish state. As an originally Catalan party, it specifically opposes Catalan nationalism due to viewing it as an outdated, authoritarian and socially divisive ideology which fuels hatred among both Catalans and Spaniards. Rivera uses the phrase \"Catalonia is my homeland, Spain is my country and Europe is our future\" to describe the party's ideology.\n\nThe party opposes separatist movements such as the Catalan independence movement and federating the autonomous communities. Even though Citizens is currently a supporter of European federalism, it ran in the 2009 European Parliament election in coalition with the pan-European, Eurosceptic party Libertas. Although reconsidering the current head of state is not a priority for the party, Rivera has said that Citizens is \"a republican party which claims that Spanish citizens are who have to decide whether they prefer a once-modernized monarchy or a republic through a referendum in the context of a constitutional reform\". According to its declared identity signs, Cs advocates four basic lines of action:\n\nCs displays a political discourse mainly centered around opposition to Catalan nationalism, to the extent that it has been frequently criticised for being a single issue party, a label rejected by its members. In the 2006–2012 period, the number of Cs voters who had voted for centre-right parties in previous elections was similar to the number who had voted for centre-left parties, suggesting that the party's positions on general economic and social issues are not its main draw. Cs criticise any sort of nationalism, \"including the Spanish nationalism that Mr. Ynestrillas defends\".\n\nOne of the main issues raised by the party is the Catalan language policy which actively promotes the use of Catalan language as the sole working language of Catalan public administration. The party challenges this policy and defends equal treatment of the Spanish and Catalan languages. It also opposes the current language policy within the Catalan educational system in accordance with which all public schooling is delivered in Catalan. The party also supports strengthening the powers of the Spanish central institutions and curtailing the powers of regional administrations.\n\nOther topics include a thorough reform of the electoral system with the aim of creating greater proportionality that would give less weight to single constituencies. They also support some changes in the 1978 Constitution, especially regarding regional organisation. Regarding the chartered autonomous communities' tax regimes, the party respects and does not want to remove the Basque Country's and Navarre's chartered regimes because it believes that \"they aren't discriminatory in and of themselves\". However, it criticises what it calls the miscalculation of the quota or contribution which is negotiated between governments and has been causing significant differences that they regard as haviing become outrageous. It proposes a review and a recalculation of the Basque and Navarrese Economic Agreements in order to stop the Basque Country and Navarre being \"net beneficiaries\". Among other policies, they also support a regulation of prostitution, marijuana and euthanasia.\n\nProminent meetings of the party have been reportedly picketed by Catalan separatist groups on several occasions. Its leader Albert Rivera has received anonymous death threats urging him to quit politics. Two members of the ERC Youth were sentenced to prison for it. Members of Ciudadanos have repeatedly taken part in violent attacks on Catalan targets and far-right and ultranationalist groups are usually present in their demonstrations. In one instance, a Telemadrid cameraman was assaulted, allegedly because he was mistaken for a member of Catalan broadcaster TV3.\n\nThe Cs outlined some policies for the 2015 general election:\n\nAlthough the party defines itself as postnationalist, it has been deemed by a variety of sources (including peer-reviewed expert texts) to profess a populist Spanish nationalist ideology. In a party conference held on 20 May 2018 to present its platform \"España Ciudadana\", Rivera said in a hall filled with flags of Spain:\nI do not see reds and blues, I see Spaniards. I do not see, as they say, urban people and rural people, I see Spaniards. I do not see young or old, I see Spaniards. I do not see workers and entrepreneurs, I see Spaniards. I do not see believers or agnostics, I see Spaniards. [...] So, compatriots, with Citizens, let's go for that Spain, let's feel proud of being Spaniards again.\n\nIn 2006, the newspaper \"El Periódico de Catalunya\" revealed that Rivera was a card-carrying member of the conservative People's Party (PP) between 2002 and 2006 and that he had left the PP only three months before running for election for the Citizen's Party. This was corroborated by \"El Mundo\" and \"El País\". Despite these revelations, Rivera denied having been a full member of PP and implied that he had voted for the PSOE until recently. Past PP membership is common among Cs members. Former PSC activist Juan Carlos Girauta had joined the PP and became a prolific contributor to conservative journalism from his \"Libertad Digital\" column before becoming a Citizens member and candidate in the 2014 European election. During his long tenure as \"Libertad Digital\" columnist and COPE debater, Girauta expressed strong sympathies for right-wing Zionism (to the point of calling then-President Zapatero an antisemite) and lent credibility to the now discredited book by Victor Farías dismissing socialist politician Salvador Allende as a racist and a social Darwinist, without clarifying that the quotations about genetic determinism in Allende's doctoral dissertation were themselves quotations from other authors (mostly Cesare Lombroso) or the fact that Allende was highly critical of these conclusions in his thesis which was later published as a rebuttal to Farías' position. Farías was later sued for this, but Girauta never retracted his statements.\n\nIn 2015, a member of the Citizens electoral list for Gijón to the city council and regional elections posted pro-Falangist, pro-Blue Division and pro-Hitler Youth messages on Facebook. Those same elections carried news of at least five other former card-carrying Falange and/or España 2000 members.\n\nAn altercation took place in Canet de Mar on 21 Ma, 2018 between pro-independence local residents, who had planted yellow crosses on the beach to honor imprisoned and fugitive politicians; and anti-independence individuals who decided to remove said crosses. The altercation left at least three people wounded, including an 82-year-old man and a local CUP councilor who explicitly accused Citizens and Falange militants from across the whole region to be among the provocateurs. Citizens Member of Parliament Carlos Carrizosa dismissed the claim that either \"councillors or party activists\" from the party were involved in the incidents. Four days later and despite admonishments and warnings by President of the Parliament Roger Torrent, Carrizosa himself removed a yellow ribbon from the seats reserved for absent Cabinet ministers, forcing the President to suspend the entire session.\n\nDuring the 2006 Catalan election campaign, the party's president Albert Rivera appeared completely naked in a poster in order to attract publicity to the party. In the beginning, the party frequently complained about an alleged boycott on the part of Catalan media. in their opinion, the party was given too little airtime to present its views on the Catalan public television.\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Cs would run for the European election allied with the Libertas coalition. The party's association with Declan Ganley's Libertas platform raised some concern on account of the coalition formed by the latter with nationalist and ultranationalist parties in each of its local European chapters, seemingly at odds with the professed ideology of Cs.\n\nSeveral intellectuals that had participated in the formation of \"Ciutadans\" later withdrew their support. For instance, Albert Boadella, became one of the co-founders of the Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD) party led by former Basque Socialist politician Rosa Díez.\nAccording to some members of Cs, the negotiations prior to this electoral pact were led personally and secretly by the party leader Albert Rivera. This alienated the other two MPs (besides Rivera himself) and a significant part of the party from his leadership.

The show was transferred back to NBC during 1951, and then to DuMont from January 10, 1952, to October 10, 1954.\n\nOn the series, two critics debated a recently published book, one in favor and the other against.

Faye Emerson had a brief stint as moderator during 1952, during which the show was transferred to prime time. Virgilia Peterson was the moderator during the DuMont run from 1952 to 1954, when the show was broadcast Thursdays at 10pm EST.\n\nThe DuMont episodes of the series were produced by Phyllis Adams Jenkins (1923-2004), a pioneer in providing serious programming intended for daytime television audiences.

She was the youngest of five children born to William De Witt Alexander and Abigail Charlotte née Baldwin Alexander. The Alexanders were a scion of two of Hawaii’s most illustrious Christian missionary families—the Alexanders and the Baldwins. Her father was one of Hawaii’s most famous men as President of Oahu College, author of \"A Brief History of the Hawaiian People,\" and first Surveyor-General of the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nAlexander graduated from Oahu College in 1875, later doing undergraduate work at Oberlin College and U.C. Berkeley. After teaching for a few years, she fell prey to chronic illness. In 1900, she joined a group of Islanders who were going on a tour of Europe. In November 1900, She was in Rome where she encountered an American Bahá’í woman and her two daughters who were returning from a Bahá’í pilgrimage in the Holy Land, then called Syria. As the result of an epiphany one night, which she described as “neither a dream nor vision”, she embraced the Bahá’í Revelation and accepted its new Manifestation, Bahá’u’lláh, whose name means ‘The Glory of God’.\n\nAt the request of Bahá’u’lláh’s eldest son, ‘Abdu’l-Baha, Miss Alexander pioneered the Bahá’í Faith in Japan in 1914. In 1921 she became the first to introduce the New Gospel in Korea. Except for extended vacations in Hawaii, Agnes spent over thirty years in Japan.\n\nAlexander became an early advocate of Esperanto and used that new international language to spread the Bahá’í teachings at meetings and conferences.\n\nAt the request of Bahá’u’lláh’s great-grandson, Agnes Alexander wrote two histories: \"Forty Years of the Bahá’í Cause in Hawaii: 1902-1942\" and \"History of the Bahá’í Faith in Japan: 1914-1938\". Both of these volumes were published posthumously.\n\nIn 1957, the head of the Bahá’í Faith, Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, appointed Agnes Alexander a Hand of the Cause of God, the highest rank one may hold as an individual Bahá’í.\n\nIn 1964, Alexander represented the Universal House of Justice, the supreme administrative body of the Bahá’í Faith, at the election of Hawaii’s first National Spiritual Assembly in Honolulu. After suffering a broken hip in 1965, and spending two years in a Tokyo hospital, Agnes Alexander returned home to Honolulu in 1967. Ironically, the Arcadia residence where she passed her last four years was adjacent to her birthplace on Punahou Street.\n\nOn January 1, 1971, Alexander died. She was buried behind Kawaiahao Church with her missionary forebears.\n\nAgnes Alexander is related to several notable people including: Amos Starr Cooke, David Dwight Baldwin, William Owen Smith, Samuel T. Alexander, Henry P. Baldwin, Annie Montague Alexander, and others. Her parents were William D. Alexander and Abigail Baldwin and grandparents William P. Alexander and Mary Ann McKinney from her father, and Dwight Baldwin and Charlotte Fowler through her mother.\n\nAlexander wrote one book on the history of the Bahá'í Faith in Japan and was covered in detail by a number of other books.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7740172", "categories": ["American Esperantists", "1971 deaths", "Hands of the Cause", "People from Hawaii", "1875 births", "Converts to the Bahá'í Faith", "American Bahá'ís", "19th-century Bahá'ís", "20th-century Bahá'ís"], "title": "Agnes Baldwin Alexander"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740179", "text": "Royal Flush (game)\n\nRoyal Flush is a solitaire card game which is played with a deck of 52 playing cards. The game is so called because the aim of the game is to end up with a royal flush of any suit. However, the game is so much mechanical in nature that there is currently no electronic or computer implementation. Its rules are so far included in printed matter such as \"The Complete Book of Solitaire and Patience Games\" by Albert Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith and \"100 Best Solitaire Games\" by Sloane Lee and Gabriel Packard.\n\nFirst, the deck is dealt into five piles: two piles of eleven cards and three piles of ten. The player first turns the first pile up and looks for either an ace, a ten, a king, a queen, and a jack, cards which comprise a royal flush. Once such a card is found, the search ends there, with the cards on top of it discarded and those under it left alone. The search then proceeds into the next pile and the search for other cards in the royal flush continues. Also, the suit of the first card found determines the suit of the entire royal flush. When a pile contains no card of the royal flush being searched, the entire pile is discarded. When another royal-flush card is found in a pile, the search continues until all five piles are searched and royal-flush cards are at the top of their piles.\n\nAfterwards, the piles are placed on top of each other in the reverse direction of the deal. So if the deal is from left to right, once the search ends, each pile is placed on its neighbor to the left. (Morehead and Mott-Smith's rule said stated that the piles should be turned face down first before the piles are gathered). The discarded cards are set aside.\n\nThen without shuffling, the remaining cards are dealt this time into four piles. After this, the search the cards of the royal flush begins again with the same procedure already stated above. Once all four piles are searched and regathered, the remaining cards (again without reshuffling) are dealt into three piles. The process continues, and after the gathering of the piles, the cards are dealt into two piles and the procedure begins once more.\n\nWhen the two piles are regathered, the remaining cards at this point are then dealt into a single pile. Even at this point, the search stops when a royal-flush card is found and the cards on top of it are discarded. The game is won when the cards of the royal flush are the only ones left in the pile and are arranged in any order. If there are any other cards sandwiched among the royal flush cards, the game is lost.\n\nTo give the game some variation, Lee and Packard (in their book \"100 Best Solitaire Games\") suggests the player to try other poker hands such as four-of-a-kinds, full houses, or straight flushes. The player can simply look for a specific hand or look for certain cards to include in his/her hand while playing the game.\n", "id": "7740179", "categories": [], "title": "Royal Flush (game)"}

The club was active for 93 years (from 1923 until 2016) before being dissolved due to financial problems. The club had several successful years in the highest division in Russian basketball. In 2006, Dynamo won a European trophy in the Eurocup.\n\nCreated in 1923 when Russia was part of the Soviet Union, Dynamo is among the oldest sports clubs in the country. Its name was chosen because Dynamo means 'power in motion'. The club was backed by the State Political Directorate (GPU), a police apparatus of the USSR. That is why the team has always been thought of as the police club, while cross-town rival CSKA Moscow was the army club. Dynamo quickly earned a reputation outside the Soviet Union borders due to its success in major sports such as football, handball, ice hockey and, of course, basketball. Dynamo Moscow won the USSR League championship in 1937 and 1948 and also made it to the final in 1944 and 1990.\n\nOver the decades, Dynamo earned a reputation for being among the strongest teams nationally and around the continent. Dynamo finished third in the Soviet Union League standings in 1946, 1957 and 1958, as well as making it to the 1952 USSR Cup final. Years of domestic obscurity followed in which the team could not achieve any remarkable domestic success. A few former Dynamo players participated in some of the most historic moments in USSR sport. Aleksandr Boloshev was a member of the Olympic Team that won the gold medal in Munich 1972. Furthermore, Vladimir Zhigili, one of the most famous players in Dynamo's history, was World Champion in Puerto Rico in 1974.\n\nThe team found new success outside its domestic borders in the mid-1990s. Dynamo made it all the way to the Cup Winners' Cup semi-final in 1991, losing to eventual champ PAOK Thessaloniki. The team also qualified for the Korać Cup in 1992. 1994 and 1995 without much success, despite having players like Sergei Bazarevich, Pavel Astakhov, Sergei Babenko or Evgeniy Pashutin. Things changed in 1996, however, as Dynamo shone in the 1996 Saporta Cup. The club brought in players like Bazarevich, Vitaly Nosov, and Valeri Daineko. Dynamo went all the way from the previous round, survived the group stage and made it to the best-of-three semi-finals playoffs. TAU Cerámica swept the series with an 87-98 road win in Moscow and a 104-93 home triumph in Vitoria, and it went on to win the title against PAOK Thessaloniki. The club could not live up to the expectations and one year after that, in 1997, Dynamo Moscow disappeared due to financial reasons despite having played the Euroleague for the first time in club history.\n\nIt was not until 2001 when Dynamo reappeared in the Russian basketball scene. MBC Dynamo Moscow was created under the support of the Dynamo society and its chairman Vladimir Pronichev. Dynamo entered the Russian League second division in the 2001-02 season and won the title that very same year, returning to the elite of Russian basketball. The club had to face new financial problems but once again the Dynamo organization, led by chairman Viktor Zakharov and his assistant Vladimir Mikhalevsky, stepped up to solve all troubles and give the team the economic stability it needed. MBC Dynamo Moscow joined the Dynamo organization in Moscow City and found a new president in his ex-coach Evgeny Gomelsky, brother of the legendary coach and former CSKA president, the late Alexander Gomelsky. Dynamo finished sixth in the 2002-03 Russian League with players like Nikita Morgunov, Martin Müürsepp, Bazarevich, Aleksander Milosserdov or Dmitri Domani, who remains now as the team captain. Dynamo did even better in the 2003-04 season, in which players like Nikos Oikonomou, Jimmy Oliver, Nikolay Padius, Damir Mršić and the late Kenyon Jones helped the team to make it to the Russian League semi-finals.\nDynamo continues taking steps forward and making a big financial effort to incorporate some of the best European players in the market. As such, for 2004-05, Dynamo signed the Euroleague all-time top rebounder, Mirsad Türkcan, the 2003-04 Euroleague regular season top scorer Lynn Greer, center Lazaros Papadopoulos and solid, well-rounded veterans such as Ariel McDonald, Trajan Langdon, Kšyštof Lavrinovič and Andrei Fetisov. Dynamo won difficult Group D in the ULEB Cup regular season and was considered a top candidate to go far in the elimination rounds, especially when the team won the first leg of the two-way eighth-finals series on the road against Hemofarm, 81-84, but lost 96-75 on their own home court. Dynamo once again has a competitive roster in which Papadopoulos, Domani and Valentin Koubrakov returned to be joined by some team-oriented players such as Ruben Douglas, Mire Chatman, Bojan Popović, Hanno Möttölä and Antonis Fotsis. Moreover, Dynamo landed one of the best head coaches in European basketball history, none other than the legendary Dušan Ivković. With the right environment, a solid roster, a great coach and the hunger to win its first-ever European title, in 2006 the team won the ULEB Cup.\nIn 2006 the club moved to its new arena in the Krylatskoe Sports Center. In the 2006-2007 season, Dynamo competed in the ULEB Euroleague, reaching the quarterfinals under monster efforts from Fotsis and Papadopoulos. They lost to Panathinaikos B.C. 0:2. A poor finish in domestic competition (4th place) lead the team returning to the ULEB Cup. Before the 2007-2008 season, coach Ivković was replaced by Svetislav Pešić, and players like Miloš Vujanić, Henry Domercant and Robertas Javtokas, who replaced Papadopoulos, were signed. Heavy favorites to win, Dynamo struggled - they made the ULEB Cup Final Eight, but lost in the semifinals to CB Girona 78:81 in a huge shock, which lead to the firing of Pešić. He was replaced by Sergei Bazarevich. Dynamo finished in 3rd place in the PBL. In the 2008-2009 season, David Blatt became head coach, and solid NBA players like Jannero Pargo and Boštjan Nachbar were signed, along with stars in Europe like Hollis Price and Darjuš Lavrinovič. Dynamo was a heavy favorite to win the EuroCup Basketball tournament, formerly the ULEB Cup. Despite playing solidly most of the way, Dynamo was plagued by financial problems - Price and Pargo left the team in January, with Brian Chase signing to replace Price. Still a favorite to win the EuroCup, Dynamo suffered a fiasco in the Final Eight tournament, losing to Hemofarm 85:93 in the quarterfinals. In the PBL, Dynamo finished in a disastrous 6th place. The next two seasons, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, Dynamo didn't have any success in European competition, never reaching the playoffs in either the EuroCup and the FIBA EuroChallenge tournaments. In the PBL, Dynamo finished in 4th place in 2009-2010, thanks in most part due to efforts by Sergey Monya and Alexey Shved. In 2010-2011, in the PBL, Dynamo finished only in 9th place. \n\nOn June 18, 2011 the club was expelled from the PBL. From then the club was playing in the second division, the Super League 1. Dynamo also briefly played in the BBL, but left early do to financial difficulties. The team left the Super League in 2015 and was dissolved a year later.\n\nTotal titles: 3\n\n\n\n", "id": "7740223", "categories": ["BC Dynamo Moscow", "Basketball teams in the Soviet Union", "Basketball teams established in 1923", "Defunct basketball teams in Russia", "Dynamo Moscow"], "title": "MBC Dynamo Moscow"}

They are found in freshwater throughout Southeast Asia. The scientific name comes from Ancient Greek \"kryptós\" (κρυπτός, \"hidden\") + \"ptéryx\" (πτέρυξ, \"fin\"). It refers to the reduced or even entirely absent dorsal fin of these catfishes.\n\nThese small- to medium-sized catfishes have opaque, transparent or translucent bodies, hence their common name Asian glass catfishes. Despite this name, only three described species have clearly transparent bodies: \"K. minor\", \"K. piperatus\" and \"K. vitreolus\". Most significant among these is the ghost catfish (\"K. vitreolus\"), which is the \"glass catfish\" most often seen in the aquarium fish trade. This species was initially confused with the larger glass catfish (\"K. bicirrhis\"; infrequent in aquarium trade) and subsequently with \"K. minor\" (essentially absent from aquarium trade). This matter was only fully resolved in 2013.\n\nWhile 18 species have been described as of 2013, the genus \"Kryprtopterus\" is notoriously rich in cryptic species. A number of these have been recognized in recent years, and more are likely to follow:\n\nSome species formerly placed in \"Kryptopterus\" are nowadays in other Siluridae genera, in particular \"Phalacronotus\" but also \"Micronema\" and \"Pterocryptis\".\n", "id": "7740273", "categories": ["Catfish genera", "Siluridae", "Freshwater fish genera", "Taxa named by Pieter Bleeker"], "title": "Kryptopterus"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740302", "text": "Automatic sequence\n\nIn mathematics and theoretical computer science, an automatic sequence (also called a k\"-automatic sequence or a k\"-recognizable sequence when one wants to indicate that the base of the numerals used is \"k\") is an infinite sequence of terms characterized by a finite automaton. The \"n\"-th term of an automatic sequence \"a\"(\"n\") is a mapping of the final state reached in a finite automaton accepting the digits of the number \"n\" in some fixed base \"k\".\n\nAn automatic set is a set of non-negative integers \"S\" for which the sequence of values of its characteristic function χ is an automatic sequence; that is, \"S\" is \"k\"-automatic if χ(\"n\") is \"k\"-automatic, where χ(\"n\") = 1 if \"n\" formula_1 \"S\" and 0 otherwise.\n\nAutomatic sequences may be defined in a number of ways, all of which are equivalent. Four common definitions are as follows.\n\nLet \"k\" be a positive integer, and let \"D\" = (\"Q\", Σ, δ, \"q\", Δ, τ) be a deterministic finite automaton \"with output\", where\n\nExtend the transition function δ from acting on single digits to acting on strings of digits by defining the action of δ on a string \"s\" consisting of digits \"s\"\"s\"...\"s\" as:\n\nDefine a function \"a\" from the set of positive integers to the output alphabet Δ as follows:\n\nwhere \"s\"(\"n\") is \"n\" written in base \"k\". Then the sequence \"a\" = \"a\"(1)\"a\"(2)\"a\"(3)... is a \"k\"-automatic sequence.\n\nAn automaton reading the base \"k\" digits of \"s\"(\"n\") starting with the most significant digit is said to be \"direct reading\", while an automaton starting with the least significant digit is \"reverse reading\". The above definition holds whether \"s\"(\"n\") is direct or reverse reading.\n\nLet φ be a \"k\"-uniform morphism of a free monoid Σ and let τ be defined as in the automata-theoretic case. If \"w\" is a fixed point of φ—that is, if \"w\" = φ(\"w\")—then \"s\" = τ(\"w\") is a \"k\"-automatic sequence. This result is due to Cobham, and it is referred to in the literature as \"Cobham's theorem\". Conversely, every \"k\"-automatic sequence is obtainable in this way.\n\nLet \"k\" ≥ 2. The \"k-kernel\" of the sequence \"s\"(\"n\") is the set of subsequences\nIn most cases, the \"k\"-kernel of a sequence is infinite. However, if the \"k\"-kernel is finite, then the sequence \"s\"(\"n\") is \"k\"-automatic.\n\nIt follows that a \"k\"-automatic sequence is necessarily a sequence on a finite alphabet.\n\nLet \"u\"(\"n\") be a sequence over an alphabet Σ and suppose that there is an injective function β from Σ to the finite field F, where \"q\" = \"p\" for some prime \"p\". The associated formal power series is \nThen the sequence \"u\" is \"q\"-automatic if and only if this formal power series is algebraic over F(\"X\"). This result is due to Christol, and it is referred to in the literature as \"Christol's theorem\".\n\nAutomatic sequences were introduced by Büchi in 1960, although his paper took a more logico-theoretic approach to the matter and did not use the terminology found in this article. The notion of automatic sequences was further studied by Cobham in 1972, who called these sequences \"uniform tag sequences\".\n\nThe term \"automatic sequence\" first appeared in a paper of Deshouillers.\n\nThe following sequences are automatic:\n\nThe Thue–Morse sequence \"t\"(\"n\") () is the fixed point of the morphism 0 → 01, 1 → 10. Since the \"n\"-th term of the Thue–Morse sequence counts the number of ones modulo 2 in the base-2 representation of \"n\", it is generated by the two-state deterministic finite automaton with output pictured here, where being in state \"q\" indicates there are an even number of ones in the representation of \"n\" and being in state \"q\" indicates there are an odd number of ones.\nHence, the Thue–Morse sequence is 2-automatic.\n\nThe \"n\"-th term of the period-doubling sequence \"d\"(\"n\") () is determined by the parity of the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing \"n\". It is also the fixed point of the morphism 0 → 01, 1 → 00. Starting with the initial term \"w\" = 0 and iterating the 2-uniform morphism φ on \"w\" where φ(0) = 01 and φ(1) = 00, it is evident that the period-doubling sequence is the fixed-point of φ(\"w\") and thus it is 2-automatic.\n\nThe \"n\"-th term of the Rudin–Shapiro sequence \"r\"(\"n\") () is determined by the number of consecutive ones in the base-2 representation of \"n\". The 2-kernel of the Rudin–Shapiro sequence is \nSince the 2-kernel consists only of \"r\"(\"n\"), \"r\"(2\"n\" + 1), \"r\"(4\"n\" + 3), and \"r\"(8\"n\" + 3), it is finite and thus the Rudin–Shapiro sequence is 2-automatic.\n\nBoth the Baum–Sweet sequence () and the regular paperfolding sequence () are automatic. In addition, the general paperfolding sequence with a periodic sequence of folds is also automatic.\n\nAutomatic sequences exhibit a number of interesting properties. A non-exhaustive list of these properties is presented below.\n\n\n\"k\"-automatic sequences are normally only defined for \"k\" ≥ 2. The concept can be extended to \"k\" = 1 by defining a 1-automatic sequence to be a sequence whose \"n\"-th term depends on the unary notation for \"n\"; that is, (1). Since a finite state automaton must eventually return to a previously visited state, all 1-automatic sequences are ultimately periodic.\n\nAutomatic sequences are robust against variations to either the definition or the input sequence. For instance, as noted in the automata-theoretic definition, a given sequence remains automatic under both direct and reverse reading of the input sequence. A sequence also remains automatic when an alternate set of digits is used or when the base is negated; that is, when the input sequence is represented in base −\"k\" instead of in base \"k\". However, in contrast to using an alternate set of digits, a change of base may affect the automaticity of a sequence.\n\nThe domain of an automatic sequence can be extended from the natural numbers to the integers via \"two-sided\" automatic sequences. This stems from the fact that, given \"k\" ≥ 2, every integer can be represented uniquely in the form formula_5 where formula_6. Then a two-sided infinite sequence \"a\"(\"n\") is (−\"k\")-automatic if and only if its subsequences \"a\"(\"n\") and \"a\"(−\"n\") are \"k\"-automatic.\n\nThe alphabet of a \"k\"-automatic sequence can be extended from finite size to infinite size via \"k\"-regular sequences.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7740302", "categories": ["Combinatorics on words", "Automata (computation)"], "title": "Automatic sequence"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740316", "text": "Dolle Dinsdag\n\nDolle Dinsdag (Mad Tuesday) took place in the Netherlands on 5 September 1944 after broadcasts alleging that Breda had been liberated caused rumours to spread across the occupied Netherlands that the liberation by Allied forces was at hand, prompting celebrations.\n\nOn 4 September 1944 the Allies had conquered Antwerp, and it was thought that they already advanced into the Netherlands. Radio Oranje broadcasts, one by the Prime Minister-in-exile Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy, increased the confusion; twice, in just over twelve hours (at 23.45 on 4 September and again in the morning of the 5th), they announced that Breda, 8 kilometers from the border with Holland, had been liberated (though in fact this success was achieved only on 29 October 1944 by forces of 1st Polish Armoured Division of General Maczek). The news spread rapidly, with underground newspapers preparing headlines announcing the \"fall of Breda\". \n\nThe German occupiers Arthur Seyss-Inquart (appointed Reichskommissar for the Occupied Netherlands in May 1940) and Hanns Albin Rauter, SS and police leader increased speculation by announcing a \"State of Siege\" for the Netherlands to the 300,000 cable radio listeners and in the newspapers of the following day:The population must maintain order ... it is strictly forbidden to flee areas that are threatened by the enemy. All orders from the military commanders must be strictly adhered to and without question ... any resistance to the occupation forces will be suppressed with force of weaponry. Any attempt to fraternize with the enemy or to hinder the German Reich and its allies in any form will be dealt with harshly; perpetrators will be shot.'\n\nDespite the threats, many Dutchmen celebrated on the streets while preparing to receive and cheer on the Allied liberators. Dutch and Orange flags and pennants were prepared, and many workers left their workplace to wait for the Allies to arrive. The extent of this optimism as measure of Dutch attitudes to Occupation has been hard for historians to gauge in the absence of any contemporary surveys, but it can be discerned as significant by researchers accessing diaries and finding an increase in births in statistics nine months after Dolle Dinsdag. German occupation forces and NSB members panicked: documents were destroyed and many fled the Netherlands for Germany. Ary Willem Gijsbert Koppejan (1919—2013), a member of the resistance organisation De Ondergedoken Camera (the Underground Camera), secretly photographed German troops fleeing the city and soldiers and collaborators waiting at the Den Haag railway station on Dolle Dinsdag.\n\nThe Allied advance could not continue as the Allies had overextended themselves and had to halt in the South of the Netherlands and Operation Market Garden in September was an outright failure since the planned Allied advance across the Rhine had to be abandoned. The occupiers' nervousness turned to aggression after the landings in Normandy in June 1944 and increased after Dolle Dinsdag. Due to this defeat, the liberation of the remaining Dutch territory was postponed until the next spring, and the northern part of the Netherlands had to wait until 5 May 1945 for their liberation. This last, terrible winter under occupation became known as the “Hunger Winter, killing approximately 25,000 victims, mostly elder males, though the toll from its related health effects is likely higher.”\n\nMad Tuesday caused the railway strikes of 1944 that started on 17 September with the code: \"De kinderen van Versteeg moeten onder de wol\" (translation: \"the children of Versteeg must \"get under the wool\"/go to bed\"). The strike would last until the complete Netherlands was liberated on 5 May 1945; the government-in-exile thought that by spreading rumors the Germans would start to panic. It worked, and by announcing the railway strike of 1944 the Germans started to panic even more, and many Germans and Dutch collaborators fled to Germany, fearing reprisals (Seyss-Inquart had already set the example; on September 3, he had sent his wife to Salzburg). The industry and supply route from and to Germany was almost completely stopped, which made it even harder for Germany to defend what still was occupied.\n\nThe originator of the phrase \"Dolle Dinsdag\" is presumed to be Willem van den Hout, alias Willem W. Waterman who first used it in a headline in the September 15 issue of his magazine \"De Gil\" ('The Yell', with 200,000 subscribers), though it had likely emerged in general usage before that. \"De Gil\" satirised the NSB, the German occupiers, and the Dutch government-in-exile, but was actually funded by the Hauptabteilung für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda, the German propaganda department.\n", "id": "7740316", "categories": ["Military history of the Netherlands during World War II"], "title": "Dolle Dinsdag"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740347", "text": "Bacary Sagna\n\nBacary Sagna (); born 14 February 1983) is a French professional footballer who currently plays for Major League Soccer club Montreal Impact. He has mainly played in the Premier League, and also for the France national team. His former manager at Arsenal, Arsène Wenger, once described him as the best right back in the Premier League. In addition to him regularly featuring as a wing-back, Sagna played as a centre back for Arsenal on several occasions.\n\nHe began his career at Auxerre, before transferring to Arsenal for £7 million in 2007. In 2014, shortly after winning the FA Cup, his first trophy at the club, he made a move to Manchester City.\nA full international since 2007, he was selected by France for two FIFA World Cup tournaments and one UEFA European Championship.\n\nSagna started his career at FC Sens. He made 87 Ligue 1 appearances for Auxerre and was part of the squad that won the Coupe de France in 2005. He also played in the UEFA Cup in each of his three seasons with the club's first team, making a total of 17 appearances in the competition. He was also voted into the Ligue 1 team of the season for his outstanding displays at the right back position. He played in the same Auxerre team as Abou Diaby, a future Arsenal teammate, and Watford centre-back Younès Kaboul. Sagna established himself as one of the best full backs of the French top tier and thus became dubbed \"Mr. Reliable\" by the club's fans. He also won Auxerre's Player of the Year award for the 2006-07 season.\n\nOn 12 July 2007, Sagna completed a move to Arsenal from Auxerre for an undisclosed fee, thought to have been an initial €9 million that could have risen to €11 million. He was given the number 3 shirt, previously worn by former defender Ashley Cole.\n\nSagna made his debut for Arsenal on 19 July 2007 as a starter in the squad that beat Turkish club Gençlerbirliği 3–0 in a friendly at Austria's Bad Waltersdorf Stadion.\n\nOn 13 February 2008, exactly one week before Arsenal were set to play the second leg of their round of 16 encounter against Milan in the Champions League, Sagna's older brother, Omar Sagna, died at the age of 28, one day before his birthday. He, however, did play the match after he was advised to by his father. Arsenal went on to win the second leg 0–2 with the same scoreline on aggregate.\n\nOn 23 March, Sagna tallied his first Premier League goal off a low header from a corner kick to give Arsenal a 1–0 lead against London rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, but later went off injured before Chelsea came back to win the game 2–1. At the end of the season, he was named in the PFA Team of the Year.\n\nSagna signed a new deal with Arsenal before the start of the 2008–09 season. Arsenal signed him for a further two years, taking his contract up to 2014. Sagna stated, \"I love Arsenal, it's a great club,\" and further added, \"The manager is also very good and next season we will be fighting for all the trophies.\" He stunningly saved Arsenal in a 2–2 draw against Aston Villa when he jumped and kicked the ball away so that Arsenal would go into half time with the lead.\n\nSagna struggled to replicate his form from the previous two seasons as injuries also prevented him from contributing to the team in the same way. He provided many assists though, his most important contribution arguably being the cross to striker Nicklas Bendtner, who gave Arsenal the 1–0 lead in the 94th minute against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite this, however, Sagna was linked away from the club with various teams, including Serie A's Internazionale, seemingly interested in taking the defender away from London.\n\nSagna scored his first goal at the Emirates Stadium for Arsenal against Celtic, a game in which Arsenal went on to win 3–2 and win the Emirates Cup for the second consecutive year. He made his 100th league start for Arsenal on 3 October 2010, a 2–0 defeat against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. On 14 November, he scored only his second ever official goal for Arsenal in a 2–1 away victory against Everton at Goodison Park, with a powerful shot from the near post. On 8 December 2010, Sagna picked up his first red card in his Arsenal career in a 3–1 home victory against Serbian club Partizan in Arsenal's final Champions League group game of the season.\n\nOn 1 January 2011, in a match with Birmingham City, he was involved in an incident where Lee Bowyer stamped on him after Sagna had gone in for a tackle. Bowyer was banned by the FA for three games for the stamp. On 5 January, Sagna picked up his second red card of the season after he and Manchester City fullback Pablo Zabaleta headbutted each other in the final moments of Arsenal's 0–0 draw with City at Emirates Stadium. On 19 January, Sagna scored his second goal of the season with Arsenal's second goal in their 3–1 victory over Leeds United at Elland Road in a third round replay. This was Sagna's career best for goal-scoring, his previous best coming in the 2007–08 season where scored only once. Sagna was included in the PFA Team of the Year for his performance in the 2010–11 season.\n\nOn 13 August 2011, Sagna started and played the full 90 minutes against Newcastle United at St James' Park in a 0–0 draw on the opening day of the 2011–12 Premier League season. On Saturday 20 August, he started at left-back and played the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 defeat at the hands of a Liverpool side that picked up its first win over the Gunners away from home in 11 years. On 28 August, Sagna missed Arsenal's game against Manchester United at Old Trafford due to illness.\n\nSagna sustained a leg break during a match against North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur after a challenge by Benoît Assou-Ekotto forced him to land awkwardly. On 29 January 2012, Sagna came off the bench against Aston Villa as an 89th-minute substitute to mark his comeback. On 26 February 2012, he started in the North London derby against Spurs, scoring a header from a Mikel Arteta cross and inspiring Arsenal to come back from being 2–0 down to go on and win 5–2. He unfortunately sustained another leg break of the same leg in the final home match of the season against Norwich City, which ruled him out of UEFA Euro 2012 in June 2012.\n\nIn October 2012, Sagna marked his return to the first team by starting in Arsenal's 1–0 victory over Queens Park Rangers. On 3 November, he started and played the full 90 minutes at right-back against Manchester United at Old Trafford, a 2–1 league defeat. In his absence with a broken leg, Carl Jenkinson started for Arsenal and earned rave reviews, but Sagna continued to be Arsenal's first-choice right back upon his return. On 9 February 2013, due to an injury to centre-back Laurent Koscielny during warm-ups, Sagna was forced to fill in as a central defender against Sunderland. He helped a ten-man Arsenal win 1–0. On 28 April 2013, Sagna committed a mistimed tackle inside the penalty box on Robin van Persie in a 1–1 home draw against Manchester United, conceding a penalty to bring the score level after a second-minute Arsenal goal from Theo Walcott.\n\nSagna remained Arsenal's first choice right-back at the start of the season, fighting off competition from Carl Jenkinson. He scored his first goal of the season, his fifth in Arsenal colours, against Stoke City on 22 September, heading in Mesut Özil's free-kick, securing a 3–1 win for the Gunners. On 17 May, Sagna started in the 2014 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Hull City 3–2 at Wembley Stadium, his first trophy at the club.\n\nIt was announced on 27 May that Sagna would not extend his contract with the Gunners, which was set to expire at the end of the season. Although Arsenal offered him a two-year extension, Sagna was believed to be \"90 per cent certain\" of leaving the Emirates, thus rejecting the contract extension. Additional sources understand that Manchester City and a number of top clubs in Europe had expressed an interest in signing him. Sagna said he did not sign a new deal with Arsenal because \"the discussions did not go in the direction that he wanted\".\n\nIt was announced on 13 June 2014 that Sagna had agreed to a deal with Manchester City to join the reigning Premier League champions after his contract with Arsenal was set to expire on 30 June. He was City's first signing of the summer and signed a three-year deal, taking the number 3 shirt. He left the club at the end of his contract in June 2017.\n\nOn 3 February 2018, Sagna signed with Serie A side Benevento Calcio for six months and a year in option.\n\nOn 8 August 2018, Sagna signed with Montreal Impact in Major League Soccer for the remainder of the 2018 season, with an option for 2019. Although the option was not taken up, Sagna subsequently signed a one-year contract to stay with the club for the 2019 season.\n\nSagna has previously represented the French under-21 team, with whom he also participated at the 2006 European Under-21 Championship.\n\nAt age 17 Sagna wished to join up with the Senegalese national team, stating, \"I wanted to play for Senegal when I was 17, but they didn't reply. So I was a bit disappointed. But when I started playing for Auxerre for the first team, they contacted me and I had a game on the same day with the French national team under 21s so I had to make a choice.\"\n\nSagna received his first senior international cap for France on 22 August 2007 in a friendly match against Slovakia on the road, which they won 1–0, coming on as a substitute for François Clerc after one hour of play. He went on to make his competitive debut for France in their 6–0 away win at the Faroe Islands on 13 October 2007 in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers, playing all 90 minutes. It was his only appearance in the Euro 2008 qualifying. He was not a candidate to join the French team at the Euro 2008 finals in Austria and Switzerland as he was still recovering from the injury sustained in Arsenal's Premier League match at Chelsea in March 2008.\n\nAfter recovering from the injury, Sagna returned to the French team for their friendly match against Sweden in August 2008, playing all 90 minutes in a 3–2 away win. He went on to become a regular in the French team's qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He was also a part of the disastrous French World Cup campaign when the team crashed out at the group stage after losing 2–1 against hosts South Africa.\n\nSagna missed out on UEFA Euro 2012 with a broken leg.\n\nBacary Sagna was born in Sens, France to Senegalese immigrant parents. He is a Muslim. In 2010, he married French-Algerian model and journalist Ludivine Kadri with whom he already had a son named Elias (born in 2009). In 2013, Kadri gave birth to the couple's second son Kais.\n\nHis cousin Ibrahima Sonko played in England for Reading and in Turkey for Akhisar Belediyespor.\n\nOn 31 March 2011, Sagna became an ambassador for Grassroot Soccer, an international non-profit that uses the power of football to educate, inspire, and mobilise communities to stop the spread of HIV.\n\nSagna is called \"Bac\" by the majority of his teammates.\n\nAuxerre\n\nArsenal\n\nManchester City\n\n\n", "id": "7740347", "categories": ["Expatriate footballers in Italy", "France under-21 international footballers", "French expatriate footballers", "Arsenal F.C. players", "AJ Auxerre players", "Manchester City F.C. players", "French Muslims", "Association football defenders", "Sportspeople from Sens", "French footballers", "Black French sportspeople", "Living people", "Serie A players", "2010 FIFA World Cup players", "Montreal Impact players", "Premier League players", "Benevento Calcio players", "French expatriate sportspeople in England", "French people of Senegalese descent", "Expatriate soccer players in Canada", "Expatriate footballers in England", "2014 FIFA World Cup players", "UEFA Euro 2016 players", "French expatriate sportspeople in Canada", "FC Sens players", "Ligue 1 players", "1983 births", "France international footballers"], "title": "Bacary Sagna"}

He was schoolmates with fellow SechsKies member, Kang Sung-hun. \n\nEun's great-uncle and his aunt on his father's side, Park Chung-hee and Park Geun-hye, served the country as President of South Korea. His aunt, however, was impeached not long after shes served. His mother used to be part of a girl group called \"Lily Sisters\".\n\nEun's nickname in Sechs Kies was \"Soy Sauce\" (깜시) because of his dark skin. \"Eun Choding\" (\"Kid Eun\") was a later nickname on the reality-variety show \"Happy Sunday: 1 Night 2 Days\" because of his childish on-screen persona.\n\nEun Ji-won and Kang Sung-hoon were discovered by a Daesung Entertainment's president, Lee Ho Yeon, who was vacationing in Hawaii. Lee formed a six-member group in which Eun became the leader, main rapper and sub-vocalist.\n\nThe group debuted in 1997, and disbanded in 2000. Eun described his time with Sechs Kies as hectic, recalling that members would retreat to their parents' homes to avoid the demanding schedule. They disappeared about two weeks, so they blew off a lot of schedule. Kim Jae-duck said \"We were arrogant at that time\". Eun Ji-won said the group's record label planned many of their media appearances without consulting the members. On the other hand, he said that it was the way to catch up with the H.O.T.. At the Korean variety show \"Happy together\" on March 10 2011, Eun Ji-won said that Sechs Kies had to maintain a very tight schedule to close the gap on its rival H.O.T.. During this time, the group's popularity rivaled that of H.O.T.. \n\nOn May 18, 2000 SechsKies announced their departure from the K-pop scene at a press conference, where a few members were tearful. Lee Jai-jin later said that the group originally intended to leave their record label without disbanding. Eun Ji-won, on the other hand, said that the members had decided it would be best to disband at the peak of their career. They had an opportunity to talk about the disbandment all together during an interview on October 17, 2016. Eun Ji-won stated that the disbandment was decided upon agreement by a majority of the members, though Lee Jai-jin was one of the members that stood against the disbandment.\n\nAfter the press conference a last music video, \"Thanks\", was released after their final concert. He said he had not seen bandmate Ko Ji-yong for seven years; Ko moved to the United States to study, and has not returned.\n\nAlthough SechsKies disbanded in 2000, in 2002 Eun performed with former member Kang Sung-hun and J-Walk Kim Jae-duck and Jang Su-won. In 2007, he performed with J-Walk on a number of music shows, including KBS' \"Yoon Do Hyun's Love Letter\" (where they performed the SechsKies song, \"Couple\") and \"Music Bank\" (performing Eun's \"Adios\" and J-Walk's \"Light Storm\"). Eun and J-Walk performed \"Couple\" at Lee Soo-geun's wedding on March 2, 2008. Eun was featured on the third J-Walk album's title track, \"My Love\" and in its music video.\n\nAfter SechsKies disbanded Eun began his solo career in 2000 with an EP including \"A-Ha\" on October 27, 2000. He wrote all the songs on his first solo album, \"G Pop\", which was released on March 29, 2001. After his successful first album, Eun refined his style and experimented with his music on his second album, \"Heavy G\".\n\nHip Hopper Eun Ji-won changed his management to Waltz Music Entertainment in 2003. Eun's third album, \"Drunk on Hip Hop\" (with the single \"Drunk on Melody\"), was released on September 6, 2003. He later reissued his third album, including a \"winter version\" of \"To Mi Casa\" and \"Never Ever\" from his first solo album. \"Drunk on Melody\" won Eun the Hip Hop Award at the 2003 SBS Gayo Awards and the KMTV Korean Music Awards. He has performed the song twice on stage with Tiger JK of Drunken Tiger on KBS' \"Yoon Do Hyun's Love Letter\".\n\nEun starred in the romantic comedy \"Marrying a High-School Girl (여고생 시집가기)\" with Lim Eun-kyung by first-time director Oh Deok-hwan, which was released on December 23, 2004. He played Park Ondal, a transfer student to the school attended by Pyung-gang (Lim). The film was about a high school girl who must marry a boy named \"Ondal\" before her sixteenth birthday, and have a baby within a year; otherwise, she would die.\n\nEun went on hiatus from the industry in mid-2006, but appeared once again when The \"Movement\" (무브먼트) (a group of rappers and hip-hop artists throughout Korea) staged a concert on May 13, 2006. Many Movement artists have been featured on Eun's albums including Drunken Tiger, Tasha (Yoon Mi Rae), Dynamic Duo and Bobby Kim.\n\nEun returned with a single, \"Adios\", after a hiatus from the music industry; his album \"Love, Death, Introspection\" (사랑 死랑 思랑) was released on October 30, 2007 with four new tracks and an instrumental version of \"Adios\". Mr. Tyfoon, Baek Ji-young and Sat Byul (샛별) were featured on the album. \"Adios\", a Latin hip-hop song, was composed by Keeproots with lyrics by Mr. Tyfoon. Tiger JK from Drunken Tiger, Mr. Tyfoon and Eun produced the album. Eun is part of 13 Creative Unit, a subsidiary of Eyagi Entertainment (which also produces singer Hwang Bo and actress Park Si Yeon).\n\nIn mid-2007, Eun appeared on the KBS reality-variety show \"Happy Sunday: 1 Night 2 Days\".

Eun was a cast member of SBS' \"Jihwaza (작렬! 정신통일)\" before the show's cancellation in September 2007.\n\nFor his fifth album, Eun selected 20 of over 100 songs. In 2007, he performed at the DKNY Party. Eun appeared on Starship Entertainment label-mate Moon Ji-eun's debut EP (released on April 10, 2008), rapping on \"Fox\" and appearing in its music video after Moon appeared in Eun's 2003 music video for \"Suddenly\" (문득). In June 2008, Eun collaborated with J-Walk (Kim Jaeduck and Jang Suwon, formerly of Sechskies) on a song for J-Walk's album, \"My Love\". Later that year Eun released \"G Code\"; its single was \"Dangerous\", a sample of Kardinal Offishall featuring Akon's version of \"Dangerous\".\n\nIn early 2009 Eun left CH Entertainment and started his own company, GYM Entertainment. The first artist to be released in his company was singer-rapper Gilme; Eun appeared on Gilme's debut song, \"Love Cuts\", and has performed the song on stage with her.\n\nAfter a year's hiatus from the music scene Eun released his fifth full-length studio album, \"Platonic\". The lead track, \"Siren\", is an electronic dance song with hip-hop rhythms. Eun collaborated with Mr. Tyfoon, Gilme and \"2 Days & 1 Night\" member Lee Su-geun on the album. The album was jointly released by GYM Entertainment and Starship Entertainment.\n\nOn March 31, 2011, Eun, Gilme and Mr. Tyfoon formed Clover, which received much attention as Eun Ji-won's new group after 10 years since Sechs Kies' disbandment. They performed \"La Vida Loca\", from their mini-album \"Classic Over\", on a number of musical shows. \"La Vida Loca\" was well-received, topping the Cyworld Music Chart even two weeks after the release.\n\nOn September 29, 2011, Clover released another digital single, \"A Guy Who I Know (아는 오빠)\".

He presented the idea that they would meet up casually to chat and reflect on topics from their past which they were not allowed to touch on back then. The show starred H.O.T.'s Moon Hee-joon and Tony An, NRG's Chun Myung-hoon, Sechs Kies's Eun Ji-won, and g.o.d's Danny Ahn. The five members named themselves HotSechgodRG — a portmanteau of each member's previous idol group names.\n\nThe first season was aired from April 16, 2013 to July 9, 2013. The show received much attention and HotSechgodRG appeared on many entertainment programs both mainstream and cable, such as \"\", \"Happy Together\" and \"Hwasin – Controller of the Heart\" (화신). The second season of the “Handsome Boys of the 20th Century” was aired from August 27, 2013 to November 19, 2013. HotSechgodRG announced that they were preparing for a Christmas concert (Legend Back). Unfortunately, Tony encountered some legal trouble and had to withdraw from the group as he was temporarily banned from broadcast appearances. The concert was canceled as they felt they could not go on without Tony. The third season was aired from November 26, 2013 to December 26, 2013 under the name \"Handsome Boys Communication (미소년 통신)\".

(August 7, 1903 as Anthony Boeddeker — January 1, 1994) was an American Franciscan friar who is best known for having founded humanitarian programs to aid the poor and marginalised in the San Francisco Bay Area. These programs, named by Father Boeddeker for Saint Anthony of Padua, include the St. Anthony Dining Room (1950), the St. Anthony Free Medical Clinic (1956), and the St. Anthony Farm, near Petaluma in Sonoma County, California. The dining room and medical clinic are part of the St. Anthony Foundation.\n\nAnthony Boeddeker was born in San Francisco, California. He joined the Franciscans in 1921 as brother Alfred and was ordained a priest in 1927. He studied theology at the Santa Barbara Seminary and pastored at the St. Rafael Church in Goleta, California. From 1930 to 1933 studied in Rome, Italy. After his return from Rome, he taught for fifteen years at the Franciscan School of Theology at the Mission Santa Barbara.\n\nBoeddeker was selected to start a Catholic university in Hankow, China. In preparation for this assignment, he enrolled in a graduate program at the University of California, Berkeley to study Mandarin, Japanese and Russian languages and Chinese history and politics. The Hankow plans were cancelled, however, after the Chinese Civil War of mainland China in 1949. Father Boeddeker was then appointed pastor of St. Boniface Church in the Tenderloin, San Francisco, California, where he remained for the rest of his life. Not far from this church, two of Boeddeker's sayings are prominently displayed on the walls of the St. Anthony Dining Room on Jones Street:\n\nA park and recreation center named after Boeddeker is located in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco. The recreation center features the sculpture \"Redding School, Self-Portrait\", (4 ft. x 16 1/2 ft. x 2 1/4 in.) which was created as a tribute to Boeddeker by artist Ruth Asawa with assistance from children at Redding Elementary School. The piece, a bas relief wall mural, consists of a portrait of Boeddeker surrounded by children and scenes from San Francisco, including animals, street cars, cars, houses, airplanes and birds. The mural is made of glass fiber reinforced concrete and is framed with a plain concrete border. Children from the school created images with pastry dough which were then added into the mural. The piece was surveyed in 1993 by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program and was described as needing conservation treatment.\n\nHartmann, Madeline. \"The Man behind the Miracle: the Story of Alfred Boeddeker, O.F.M.\" Fort Bragg: Lost Coat Press (2000). \n\n\n", "id": "7740420", "categories": ["American humanitarians", "History of San Francisco", "American theologians", "1903 births", "American Friars Minor", "1994 deaths", "Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany"], "title": "Alfred Boeddeker"}

He played rugby union at fly half or centre.\n\nAlong with Cleary, following the South African Wallaby tour he made the code switch and joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1962 . He played 106 grade games with the club till 1968. After just one appearance in the professional code in 1961 he was selected for New South Wales. Three weeks later with still only one club appearance under his belt Lisle made his international rugby league debut in the third test in Sydney against the visiting Great Britain. This stands as the fastest rise to international representative status in Australian rugby league history.\n\nAt season end after just five club appearances he was selected in the all conquering 1963 Kangaroo tour of England and France though he did not play in any Tests on the tour. He was Australia's 30th dual code rugby international following Michael Cleary and preceding Dick Thornett.\n\nLisle played in the premiership winning Souths side of 1967. He played his rugby league at five-eighth.\n\nPost football Lisle studied for a Masters of Education at the University of Oregon in the USA. He died in 2003.\n\nOutside of Rugby League duties he was a Physical Education Teacher at Bass and Randwick Boys High Schools.\n\nIn 2004 he was named by the Souths in their \"South Sydney Dream Team\", consisting of 17 players and a coach representing the club from 1908 through to 2004.\n\n\n", "id": "7740465", "categories": ["1939 births", "Australian rugby league players", "South Sydney Rabbitohs players", "Dual-code rugby internationals", "South Sydney Rabbitohs captains", "Australia national rugby league team players", "Australia international rugby union players", "Australian rugby union players", "2003 deaths"], "title": "Jimmy Lisle"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740467", "text": "Etymology of chemistry\n\nIn the history of science, the etymology of the word chemistry is debatable. It is agreed that the word derives from the word \"alchemy\", which is a European one, derived from \"kimiya\" () and alchemy \"al-kīmiyāʾ\" (). The Arabic term is derived from the Ancient Greek \"khēmia\" or \"khēmeia\". However, the ultimate origin of the root word, \"chem\", is uncertain.\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"al-kīmiyāʾ\" is derived from , which is derived from the ancient Egyptian name of Egypt (\"khem\" or \"khm\", \"khame\", or \"khmi\", meaning \"blackness\" Therefore, alchemy is the \"Black Art\". However, it is also possible that \"al-kīmiyāʾ\" derived from , meaning \"cast together\".\n\nThere are two main views on the derivation of the word, which agree in holding that it has an Arabic descent, the prefix \"al\" being the Arabic article. But according to one, the second part of the word comes from the Greek \"χημεία\", pouring, infusion, used in connexion with the study of the juices of plants, and thence extended to chemical manipulations in general; this derivation accounts for the old-fashioned spellings \"chymist\" and \"chymistry\". The other view traces it to \"khem\" or \"khame\", hieroglyph \"khmi\", which denotes black earth as opposed to barren sand, and occurs in Plutarch as \"χημεία\"; on this derivation alchemy is explained as meaning the \"Egyptian art\". The first occurrence of the word is said to be in a treatise of Julius Firmicus, an astrological writer of the 4th century, but the prefix al there must be the addition of a later copyist. In English, Piers Plowman (1362) contains the phrase \"experimentis of alconomye\", with variants \"alkenemye\" and \" alknamye\". The prefix \"al\" began to be dropped about the middle of the 16th century (further details of which are given below).\n\nAccording to the Egyptologist Wallis Budge, the Arabic word \"al-kīmiyaʾ\" actually means \"the Egyptian [science]\", borrowing from the Coptic word for \"Egypt\", \"kēme\" (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval Bohairic dialect of Coptic, \"khēme\"). This Coptic word derives from Demotic \"kmỉ\", itself from ancient Egyptian \"kmt\". The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour \"black\" (Egypt was the \"Black Land\", by contrast with the \"Red Land\", the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname \"Egyptian black arts\". However, according to Mahn, this theory may be an example of folk etymology. Assuming an Egyptian origin, chemistry is defined as follows:\n\nThus, according to Budge and others, chemistry derives from an Egyptian word \"khemein\" or \"khēmia\", \"preparation of black powder\", ultimately derived from the name \"khem\", Egypt. A decree of Diocletian, written about 300 AD in Greek, speaks against \"the ancient writings of the Egyptians, which treat of the \"khēmia\" transmutation of gold and silver\".\n\nArabic \"al-kīmiyaʾ\" or \"al-khīmiyaʾ\" ( or ), according to some, is thought to derive from the Koine Greek word \"khymeia\" () meaning \"the art of alloying metals, alchemy\"; in the manuscripts, this word is also written \"khēmeia\" () or \"kheimeia\" (), which is the probable basis of the Arabic form. According to Mahn, the Greek word χυμεία \"khumeia\" originally meant \"pouring together\", \"casting together\", \"weld\", \"alloy\", etc. (cf. Gk. \"kheein\" () \"to pour\"; \"khuma\" (), \"that which is poured out, an ingot\"). Assuming a Greek origin, chemistry is defined as follows:\n\nLater medieval Latin had \"alchimia / alchymia\" \"alchemy\", \"alchimicus\" \"alchemical\", and \"alchimista\" \"alchemist\". The mineralogist and humanist Georg Agricola (died 1555) was the first to drop the Arabic definite article \"al-\". In his Latin works from 1530 on he exclusively wrote \"chymia\" and \"chymista\" in describing activity that we today would characterize as chemical or alchemical. As a humanist, Agricola was intent on purifying words and returning them to their classical roots. He had no intent to make a semantic distinction between \"chymia\" and \"alchymia\".\n\nDuring the later sixteenth century Agricola's new coinage slowly propagated. It seems to have been adopted in most of the vernacular European languages following Conrad Gessner's adoption of it in his extremely popular pseudonymous work, \"Thesaurus Euonymi Philiatri De remediis secretis: Liber physicus, medicus, et partim etiam chymicus\" (Zurich 1552). Gessner's work was frequently re-published in the second half of the 16th century in Latin and was also published in a number of vernacular European languages, with the word spelled without the \"al-\".\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe the forms \"alchimia\" and \"chimia\" (and \"chymia\") were synonymous and interchangeable. The semantic distinction between a rational and practical science of \"chimia\" and an occult \"alchimia\" arose only in the early eighteenth century.\n\nIn 16th, 17th and early 18th century English the spellings — both with and without the \"\"al\"\" — were usually with an \"i\" or \"y\" as in \"chimic / chymic / alchimic / alchymic\". During the later 18th century the spelling was re-fashioned to use a letter \"e\", as in \"chemic\" in English. In English after the spelling shifted from \"chimical\" to \"chemical\", there was corresponding shift from \"alchimical\" to \"alchemical\", which occurred in the early 19th century. In French, Italian, Spanish and Russian today it continues to be spelled with an i as in for example Italian \"chimica\".\n\n", "id": "7740467", "categories": ["Etymologies"], "title": "Etymology of chemistry"}

The Metaphor machine was one of the first commercial workstations to offer a complete hardware/software package and a GUI. Although the company achieved some commercial success, it never achieved the fame of either the Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows.\n\nDavid Liddle and Donald Massaro founded Metaphor in 1982 after leaving Xerox PARC. By 1987, the company had an annual revenue of $39.7 million. In 1991, IBM, one of its primary customers, acquired the company outright.\n\nThe Metaphor workstation had a wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, wireless numeric pad, and a wireless 5-function keypad. All these input devices docked in the desktop workstation where they were recharged. Objects on the desktop and open applications had a uniform command set that could be controlled by the keypad which had Copy, Move, Delete, Options, and Size. Workstations were connected with Ethernet. The industrial design of the workstation was done by Mike Nutall of Matrix Product Design. It won a gold medal from the IDSA. The workstation itself was engineered by James Yurchenco at David Kelley Design. Both Matrix and David Kelley Design were precursors of IDEO.\n\nTwo different workstations models were produced. Workstation One had an external electronics enclosure. Workstation Two had integrated electronics. A Workstation Three, which included a color screen, was designed through final prototypes, but was never taken into production.\n\nXerox PARC in 1973 began development of the Alto, widely shown in 1979. The Alto was the first computer with a bitmap display, mouse and a desktop metaphor as a graphical user interface (GUI). Xerox commercialized it as the Xerox Star.\n\nThe Metaphor GUI provided a unique visualization of end-to-end elements in an enterprise. In total, Metaphor branded this as a Data Interpretation System (DIS), which is a class of Decision Support System (DSS) \nThe DIS software was designed to show in one workflow, the access of data from SQL databases, its analysis and then its presentation. This was accomplish by using graphically iconic applications for database gateway, spreadsheet, plot, email, and printing tools all connected by arrows. These were animated when the workflow ran. The workflow collection was called a Capsule.\n\nThe heart of the Metaphor DIS system was the Capsule. Basically, a capsule was a simplified BATCH program. Because Metaphor applications were built so they communicated with each other, they could be moved into a folder and automated in a \"Capsule\". (The name was taken from the manned space capsules of the time.)\n\nThe functionality of the Word Processor, Spreadsheet, and Data Retrieval tools were no better than their Microsoft Office counterparts (in fact, they had a smaller sub-set of features than Office). The primary advantage of Metaphor's system was the degree to which applications were linked together. Complex reiterative data-retrieval jobs were able to be created on-the-fly by a user with no programming knowledge.\n\nA user could visually drag fields from multiple databases into the Data Retrieval tool (which would generate its own SQL code based on the fields, links and criteria displayed) and send the output directly into a spreadsheet for sorting, calculations, and graphs. The report could then be sent into a pre-formatted Word Processing document, sent to the printer, and even e-mailed to a pre-designated distribution list. The whole process would repeat for each SKU, Region, Price Code, etc. without any human interaction.\n\nEven in today's GUI designs, this abstract conception of the desktop has never been attempted because it requires the interoperation of every application, a uniform dataflow model, and a communication protocol usable by a supervisor in a programmatic way.\n\nIn March 2000, IBM licensed the Metaphor IBM Intelligent Decision Server (IDS) technology to Relational Development Systems (RDS), which was renamed Meta5.\n\nMetaphor and IBM created a venture called Patriot Partners in 1990. The attempt was to create an organization that could produce a solid business line of object-oriented software. Rather than capitalize the venture, IBM purchased the Metaphor software division in 1991 and operated it as a wholly owned, independent subsidiary, and the hardware and field repair division was spun off into its own company, Sequence Support Services. In May 1992, Sequence Support Services ceased operations. In October 1994, Metaphor ceased operations.\n\n", "id": "7740549", "categories": ["Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area", "Companies based in Mountain View, California", "Defunct computer companies of the United States", "Defunct companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area", "Defunct software companies of the United States"], "title": "Metaphor Computer Systems"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740581", "text": "Hurricane Dean (1989)\n\nHurricane Dean was the fourth named storm and second hurricane of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. Dean formed on July 31 and reached tropical storm status the following day east of the Leeward Islands. Dean brushed the northern Leeward Islands as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, bringing light rain but producing no damage, before turning northward and striking Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane. Dean continued northward before making landfall in southeastern Newfoundland.\n\nSince Dean was initially difficult to forecast, it posed a possible threat to the Lesser Antilles, as a result, several evacuations occurred, and many hurricane watches and warning were issued. However, as Dean turned northward, all watches and warnings in the Lesser Antilles were discontinued. As Dean approached Bermuda, a hurricane watch was issued, and was later upgraded to a hurricane warning. After Dean tracked away from the island, the hurricane warning was discontinued. In addition, a hurricane warning was briefly in effect for Sable Island, Nova Scotia. The storm left $8.9 million (1989 USD, $  USD) and sixteen injuries across Bermuda, but no fatalities were reported. In Atlantic Canada, Dean dropped light rain across Nova Scotia and Sable Island.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery. By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified, using the Dvorak Technique, by satellite analysts at the National Hurricane Center, in part due to persistent deep convection. Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved westward at 17 mph (28 km/h), intensifying as it did so, and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm, which was named \"Dean\" by the National Hurricane Center.\n\nContinuing generally westward, Dean continued to gradually intensify and became a hurricane on August 2 after an Air Force reconnaissance flight had recorded hurricane-force winds. The following day a decreasing ridge of high pressure to the north and a trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States caused Dean to slow in its forward motion and turn northwest. The trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States was deepening, causing Dean to curve northward while remaining nearly stationary. After remaining nearly stationary, Dean began to accelerate to a forward speed of 17 mph (28 km/h) as it headed toward Bermuda. Thereafter, Dean intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, whilst the eastern half of the eyewall brushed Bermuda. Dean continued to intensify slightly after passing the island of Bermuda and became a Category 2 hurricane on August 7. While Dean was a Category 2 hurricane, it attained its peak intensity with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 968 mbar (hPa; 28.59 inHg).\n\nAfter peak intensity, the forward speed of Dean continued to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane. While approaching southern Newfoundland, Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8. Shortly thereafter, Dean then made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65 mph (105 km/h). Later that day, Dean emerged into the far north Atlantic and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day.\n\nHurricane Dean was very difficult to forecast in its early stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to four days.\n\nRegardless, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings for Guadeloupe on August 2 and the rest of the Leeward Islands extending to the Virgin Islands. The uncertainty of the hurricanes forecast track forced residents and tourists in the Lesser Antilles to evacuate. In the British Virgin Islands, 80 American and Canadian tourists evacuated to hotels. In Puerto Rico, residents were advised to secure or stow away loose objects and stock up on emergency supplies. 1.1 million residents in the city of San Juan went to supermarkets to get much needed supplies in anticipation that the storm might hit Puerto Rico. In Humacao, the National Guard evacuated 1,966 people living along a coastal highway. The islands of Martinique and Dominica were placed under a hurricane watch. The warning for Guadeloupe was discontinued at 2200 UTC when the hurricane posed no threat to the island. Simultaneously, the hurricane watches in effect for Martinique and Dominica were also discontinued. As Dean continued westward, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands. The watch was soon canceled as Dean made its northward turn towards Bermuda.\n\nIn Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch on August 5. The hurricane watch was later changed to a hurricane warning the following day. Dean’s approach to the island canceled numerous inbound and outbound flights. In Atlantic Canada, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for Nova Scotia and Sable Island, while the Canadian forecasters issued a high wind advisory.\n\nThe outer bands of Hurricane Dean produced heavy rainfall and winds up to 75 mph (121 km/h) across Antigua and Barbuda. There was no reported damage in the Leeward Islands or the Virgin Islands since the hurricane turned northward. In the Atlantic, a sailboat bound for Bermuda was caught off guard by the hurricane. The boat, which carried no radio equipment, was spotted by a hurricane hunter plane. The occupants of the boat suffered no injuries. In Bermuda, the hurricanes eastern eyewall produced 81 mph (130 km/h) sustained winds with gusts up to 113 mph (182 km/h). Bermuda highest rainfall total from Dean was 2.45 in (50.8 mm) while parts of the island received 3-5 in (76.2–127 mm) of rain.\n\nStrong winds from Hurricane Dean caused considerable power line damage, leaving 65,000 residents without electricity. The winds also caused minor roof damage. In Hamilton Harbor, 20 pleasure boats were damaged or sent adrift due to the rough seas. Flooding from the hurricane damaged fifteen houses. Sixteen people were injured by the hurricane, five of the injuries were considered serious. There were, however, no reports of fatalities from Dean’s impact on Bermuda. Damage in Bermuda amounted up to $8.9 million (1989 USD, $  USD).\n\nAlthough Dean remained away from the United States coastline, it produced storm tides of 1.7 ft (0.51 m) to North Carolina. In Atlantic Canada, hurricane-force winds were reported in Nova Scotia and Sable Island. Newfoundland reported winds of only 50 mph (80 km/h). Moderate rainfall was reported on Newfoundland, with most areas of the island experiencing at least 1 in (25.4 mm) of precipitation. Rainfall on Newfoundland peaked at 2.7 in (68.58 mm) on the south coast of the island, near the location of Dean's landfall. A majority of rainfall was reported on the west side of Dean, but minimal precipitation had been recorded to the east of the storm. High winds were reported on the eastern side of the storm, however, with lighter winds along the western quadrants of Dean. Offshore, waves up to 26 ft (7.92 m) were reported and Sable Island reported rainfall of 0.59 in (15 mm). Although there were no reports of damage in Atlantic Canada from Hurricane Dean, three sailors had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard when their boat got dismasted during the storm.\n\n", "id": "7740581", "categories": ["Category 2 Atlantic hurricanes", "1989 Atlantic hurricane season", "Hurricanes in Bermuda", "1989 in Canada", "Hurricanes in Canada"], "title": "Hurricane Dean (1989)"}

It has been providing insurance products for more than 70 years and now provides cover solely via Lloyd's Syndicate 218. ERS offers a diverse range of products, including private car, classic car, van, motorcycle, taxi, minibus, fleet, haulage, agricultural vehicle and motor breakdown.\n\nERS began life in 1946 as Equity Motor Policies, a Lloyd's syndicate. In 1987 the company merged with Red Star to form Equity Red Star. Nine years later the company was bought by Cox Insurance, a Lloyd's underwriting business specialising in nuclear, marine and catastrophe insurance.\n\nIn 2002, following losses incurred due to 9/11, Cox Insurance withdrew from its commercial insurance activity to focus on personal lines. The business raised new equity capital to support its motor underwriting operation. \n\nA management buyout of the business in 2005 led to a new focus and a new name, Equity Insurance Group – led by CEO, Neil Utley – backed by investors Englefield and Duke Street Capital. It was headquartered at Brentwood,Essex. Further facilities are located in Colchester and Swansea. The group's high street broking network was rebranded, converging Bennetts, Insure-shop and JMW to become Equity Insurance Brokers.\n\nOn 4 December 2006, Australian insurer Insurance Australia Group announced that it would acquire Equity Insurance Group for £570 million and Open + Direct Insurance Services, the largest retail broking operation in Northern Ireland.. The acquisition was completed on 8 January 2007 and Neil Utley, then CEO, joined the executive team of IAG. IAG also acquired Barnett & Barnett in 2008, and went on to dispose of its branch-based broking in 2009.\n\nIn May 2012, IAG announced a strategic review of its UK operations, selling Barnett & Barnett and the NBJ Broking arm. In April 2013 US Private Equity company Aquiline purchased Equity Insurance Group from IAG for £80 million. This prompted a transformation programme which led to the sale of EDBL and its personal accident and household books to Canopius. In April 2014, Equity Insurance Group rebranded to ERS and became a \"motor only, broker only\" insurer. It now operates solely as an A+ rated Lloyd's syndicate 218.[1]\n\nIn 2014 ERS underwent structural changes to drive further organisational efficiencies and implement steps to help the company achieve its goal of a 90% combined operational ratio. This involved consolidating ERS’ offices into two locations (London and Swansea) and expanding both locations for growth. As a result, the Brentwood head office was closed with the majority of work that had been undertaken there split between London and Swansea. However servicing for ERS’ direct classic car arm, RH Insurance, remains in Brentwood at an alternative site.\n\nERS announced a full calendar year profit of £8.3m, the first it has reported since 2009 and a £28m improvement year on year. The combined ratio improved by 6.6% to 101% from the prior year, with improvements across all ratios but the majority of improvement coming from the loss ratio. Gross written premiums £388m, down from £406m.\n\nERS has approved the closure of its 2012 year of account with a small profit, £1.4m, 0.3% of capacity. This is the first year of account since 2007 to close with a profit and is an improvement on the forecast provided last year which was for a small loss of £1.1m or 0.2% of capacity. The forecast released for the 2013 year of account remains a small loss of 0.9% of capacity with a forecast of −5.9% to +4.1%. This is an improvement on the forecast at the same point last year which was −7.3% to +2.7% and also an improvement on the Q3 2014 forecast.\n\nThe calendar year profit for 2015 was 6.0m and the combined ratio improved to 99.8% (2014: 101%) and is below 100% for the first time since 2009, with improvements across all ratios but the majority of improvement coming from the loss ratio. Gross written premiums £394m, an increase of 2% from 2014.\n\nERS has approved the closure of its 2013 year of account with a profit, £10.7m, 2.4% of capacity, this is an improvement from a year ago which forecast 2013 as a small loss of 0.9% of capacity and a range of −5.9% to +4.1%.

Bumble (Olivier B. Bommel in Dutch) series by Marten Toonder.\n\nThe Professor uses several well-known catchphrases:\n\nThe language is characterised by an abundance of composite words built on the combination of words literally translated from German, but in a small number of cases including a Slavic word. Often, the particular combination in Dutch may create a hint or an echo of a totally unconnected word. For instance, \"mislinger\" (loser,failure, a person) combines the Dutch word mis (miss = wrong, failure) with the German word (ge)lingen (succeed) creating a word which hints at \"slinger\" (pendulum or festoon). The actual Dutch word is \"mislukkeling\". Professor Prlwytzkofsky calls disturbed brains \"verhoornde hersenschors\" - horned cerebral cortex. \"Verhoornd\" (horned) rhymes with \"verstoord\" (disturbed), which is the meaning here, but actually translates the German word for brain, which is \"Gehirn\". Without knowledge of the German word, one may be led to think that the phrase refers to the brains of a cuckold.\n\nA Slavic influence is obvious in Prlwytzkofsky calling his assistant Alexander Pieps (a mouse) \"Irkoetsk\" (\"short-statured assistant, who always manages to do things in the wrong way\", but of course also referring to the Siberian town).\n\nClearest examples of Germanization are:\n\n(but since all words not of the female sex but ending in a consonant or diphthong take \"Der\" as their article, this also hides a Slavic substratum and simplifies the Prlwytzkofsky gender system, compared to Dutch and German)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7740632", "categories": [], "title": "Prlwytzkofsky"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740682", "text": "Magnetic domain\n\nA magnetic domain is a region within a magnetic material in which the magnetization is in a uniform direction. This means that the individual magnetic moments of the atoms are aligned with one another and they point in the same direction. When cooled below a temperature called the Curie temperature, the magnetization of a piece of ferromagnetic material spontaneously divides into many small regions called magnetic domains. The magnetization within each domain points in a uniform direction, but the magnetization of different domains may point in different directions. Magnetic domain structure is responsible for the magnetic behavior of ferromagnetic materials like iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys, and ferrimagnetic materials like ferrite. This includes the formation of permanent magnets and the attraction of ferromagnetic materials to a magnetic field. The regions separating magnetic domains are called domain walls, where the magnetization rotates coherently from the direction in one domain to that in the next domain. The study of magnetic domains is called micromagnetics.\n\nMagnetic domains form in materials which have magnetic ordering; that is, their dipoles spontaneously align due to the exchange interaction. These are the ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials, in which the dipoles align in response to an external field but do not spontaneously align, do not have magnetic domains.\n\nMagnetic domain theory was developed by French physicist Pierre-Ernest Weiss who, in 1906, suggested existence of magnetic domains in ferromagnets. He suggested that large number of atomic magnetic moments (typically 10-10) were aligned parallel. The direction of alignment varies from domain to domain in a more or less random manner, although certain crystallographic axis may be preferred by the magnetic moments, called easy axes. Weiss still had to explain the reason for the spontaneous alignment of atomic moments within a ferromagnetic material, and he came up with the so-called Weiss mean field. He assumed that a given magnetic moment in a material experienced a very high effective magnetic field due to the magnetization of its neighbors. In the original Weiss theory the mean field was proportional to the bulk magnetization M, so that\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere formula_2 is the mean field constant. However this is not applicable to ferromagnets due to the variation of magnetization from domain to domain. In this case, the interaction field is\n\nformula_3\n\nWhere formula_4 is the saturation magnetization at 0K.\n\nLater, the quantum theory made it possible to understand the microscopic origin of the Weiss field. The exchange interaction between localized spins favored a parallel (in ferromagnets) or an anti-parallel (in anti-ferromagnets) state of neighboring magnetic moments\n\nThe reason a piece of magnetic material such as iron spontaneously divides into separate domains, rather than exist in a state with magnetization in the same direction throughout the material, is to minimize its internal energy. A large region of ferromagnetic material with a constant magnetization throughout will create a large magnetic field extending into the space outside itself \"(diagram a, right)\". This requires a lot of \"magnetostatic energy\" stored in the field. To reduce this energy, the sample can split into two domains, with the magnetization in opposite directions in each domain \"(diagram b right)\". The magnetic field lines pass in loops in opposite directions through each domain, reducing the field outside the material. To reduce the field energy further, each of these domains can split also, resulting in smaller parallel domains with magnetization in alternating directions, with smaller amounts of field outside the material.\n\nThe domain structure of actual magnetic materials does not usually form by the process of large domains splitting into smaller ones as described here. When a sample is cooled below the Curie temperature, for example, the equilibrium domain configuration simply appears. But domains can split, and the description of domains splitting is often used to reveal the energy tradeoffs in domain formation.\n\nAs explained above, a domain which is too big is unstable, and will divide into smaller domains. But a small enough domain will be stable and will not split, and this determines the size of the domains created in a material. This size depends on the balance of several energies within the material. Each time a region of magnetization splits into two domains, it creates a domain wall between the domains, where magnetic dipoles (molecules) with magnetization pointing in different directions are adjacent. The exchange interaction which creates the magnetization is a force which tends to align nearby dipoles so they point in the same direction. Forcing adjacent dipoles to point in different directions requires energy. Therefore, a domain wall requires extra energy, called the domain wall energy, which is proportional to the area of the wall.\n\nThus the net amount that the energy is reduced when a domain splits is equal to the difference between the magnetic field energy saved, and the additional energy required to create the domain wall. The field energy is proportional to the cube of the domain size, while the domain wall energy is proportional to the square of the domain size. So as the domains get smaller, the net energy saved by splitting decreases. The domains keep dividing into smaller domains until the energy cost of creating an additional domain wall is just equal to the field energy saved. Then the domains of this size are stable. In most materials the domains are microscopic in size, around 10 - 10 m .\n\nAn additional way for the material to further reduce its magnetostatic energy is to form domains with magnetization at right angles to the other domains \"(diagram c, right)\", instead of just in opposing parallel directions. These domains, called \"flux closure domains\", allow the field lines to turn 180° within the material, forming closed loops entirely within the material, reducing the magnetostatic energy to zero. However, forming these domains incurs two additional energy costs. First, the crystal lattice of most magnetic materials has magnetic anisotropy, which means it has an \"easy\" direction of magnetization, parallel to one of the crystal axes. Changing the magnetization of the material to any other direction takes additional energy, called the \"\"magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy\"\".\n\nThe other energy cost to creating domains with magnetization at an angle to the \"easy\" direction is caused by the phenomenon called magnetostriction. When the magnetization of a piece of magnetic material is changed to a different direction, it causes a slight change in its shape. The change in magnetic field causes the magnetic dipole molecules to change shape slightly, making the crystal lattice longer in one dimension and shorter in other dimensions. However, since the magnetic domain is \"squished in\" with its boundaries held rigid by the surrounding material, it cannot actually change shape. So instead, changing the direction of the magnetization induces tiny mechanical stresses in the material, requiring more energy to create the domain. This is called \"\"magnetoelastic anisotropy energy\"\".\n\nTo form these closure domains with \"sideways\" magnetization requires additional energy due to the aforementioned two factors. So flux closure domains will only form where the magnetostatic energy saved is greater than the sum of the \"exchange energy\" to create the domain wall, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and the magnetoelastic anisotropy energy. Therefore, most of the volume of the material is occupied by domains with magnetization either \"up\" or \"down\" along the \"easy\" direction, and the flux closure domains only form in small areas at the edges of the other domains where they are needed to provide a path for magnetic field lines to change direction \"(diagram c, above)\".\n\nThe above describes magnetic domain structure in a perfect crystal lattice, such as would be found in a single crystal of iron. However most magnetic materials are polycrystalline, composed of microscopic crystalline grains. These grains are \"not\" the same as domains. Each grain is a little crystal, with the crystal lattices of separate grains oriented in random directions. In most materials, each grain is big enough to contain several domains. Each crystal has an \"easy\" axis of magnetization, and is divided into domains with the axis of magnetization parallel to this axis, in alternate directions.\n\nIt can be seen that, although on a microscopic scale almost all the magnetic dipoles in a piece of ferromagnetic material are lined up parallel to their neighbors in domains, creating strong \"local\" magnetic fields, energy minimization results in a domain structure that minimizes the \"large-scale\" magnetic field. The magnetization of neighboring domains point in different directions, confining the field lines to microscopic loops between neighboring domains within the material, so the combined fields cancel at a distance. Therefore, a bulk piece of ferromagnetic material in its lowest energy state has little or no external magnetic field. The material is said to be \"unmagnetized\".\n\nHowever, the domains can also exist in other configurations in which their magnetization mostly points in the same direction, creating an external magnetic field. Although these are not minimum energy configurations, due to a phenomenon where the domain walls become \"pinned\" to defects in the crystal lattice they can be \"local\" minimums of the energy, and therefore can be very stable. Applying an external magnetic field to the material can make the domain walls move, causing the domains aligned with the field to grow, and the opposing domains to shrink. When the external field is removed, the domain walls remain pinned in their new orientation and the aligned domains produce a magnetic field. This is what happens when a piece of ferromagnetic material is \"magnetized\" and becomes a permanent magnet.\n\nHeating a magnet, subjecting it to vibration by hammering it, or applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field from a degaussing coil, tends to pull the domain walls free from their pinned states, and they will return to a lower energy configuration with less external magnetic field, thus \"demagnetizing\" the material.\n\nThe contributions of the different internal energy factors described above is expressed by the free energy equation proposed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz in 1935, which forms the basis of the modern theory of magnetic domains. The domain structure of a material is the one which minimizes the Gibbs free energy of the material. For a crystal of magnetic material, this is the Landau-Lifshitz free energy, \"E\", which is the sum of these energy terms:\n\nwhere\n\nSome sources define a wall energy \"E\" equal to the sum of the exchange energy and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, which replaces \"E\" and \"E\" in the above equation.\n\nA stable domain structure is a magnetization function M(x), considered as a continuous vector field, which minimizes the total energy \"E\" throughout the material. To find the minimums a variational method is used, resulting in a set of nonlinear differential equations, called \"Brown's equations\" after William Fuller Brown Jr. Although in principle these equations can be solved for the stable domain configurations M(x), in practice only the simplest examples can be solved. Analytic solutions do not exist, and numerical solutions calculated by the finite element method are computationally intractable because of the large difference in scale between the domain size and the wall size. Therefore, micromagnetics has evolved approximate methods which assume that the magnetization of dipoles in the bulk of the domain, away from the wall, all point in the same direction, and numerical solutions are only used near the domain wall, where the magnetization is changing rapidly.\n\nThere are a number of microscopy methods that can be used to visualize the magnetization at the surface of a magnetic material, revealing the magnetic domains. Each method has a different application because not all domains are the same. In magnetic materials, domains can be circular, square, irregular, elongated, and striped, all of which have varied sizes and dimensions.\n\nLarge domains, within the range of 25-100 micrometers can be easily seen by Kerr microscopy, which uses the magneto-optic Kerr effect, which is the rotation of the polarization of light reflected from a magnetized surface.\n\nLorentz microscopy is a transmission electron microscopy technique used to study magnetic domain structures at very high resolution. Off-axis electron holography is a related technique used to observe magnetic structures by detecting nanoscale magnetic fields.\n\nAnother technique for viewing sub-microscopic domain structures down to a scale of a few nanometers is magnetic force microscopy. MFM is a form of atomic force microscopy that uses a magnetically coated probe tip to scan the sample surface.\n\nBitter patterns are a technique for imaging magnetic domains that were first observed by Francis Bitter. The technique involves placing a small quantity of ferrofluid on the surface of a ferromagnetic material. The ferrofluid arranges itself along magnetic domain walls, which have higher magnetic flux than the regions of the material located within domains.\nA modified Bitter technique has been incorporated into a widely used device, the Large Area Domain Viewer, which is particularly useful in the examination of grain-oriented silicon steels.\n\n", "id": "7740682", "categories": ["Magnetic ordering"], "title": "Magnetic domain"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740798", "text": "Hawala scandal\n\nThe Hawala scandal, also called the Jain Diaries case or the hawala scam was an Indian political and financial scandal involving payments allegedly sent by politicians (black money) through four hawala brokers, namely the Jain brothers. It was a US$18 million bribery scandal that implicated some of the country's leading politicians.\n\nIn 1991, an arrest linked to militants in Kashmir led to a raid on hawala brokers, revealing evidence of large-scale payments to national politicians. On 25 March 1991, as per the court proceedings published by the Supreme court of India, Ashfak Hussain Lone, a person alleged to be an official of the terrorist organisation Hizbul Mujahideen, was arrested in Delhi. During his interrogation, the police learnt that his organisation was funded through hawala, using Surendra Kumar Jain and his family as a conduit. Based on this and further information received during Lone's interrogation, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducted raids on the premises of Surrender Kumar Jain, his brothers, relations and businesses. During the raids, the CBI seized Indian and foreign currency, two diaries and two note books at the premises. These diaries contained detailed accounts of vast payments made to people identified only by initials. The initials corresponded to the initials of high ranking politicians, both in power and out of power, and of high ranking bureaucrats. At this stage, the investigation stopped at the CBI and neither the Jains, nor the contents of their diaries were investigated by the CBI. Meanwhile, officers of the CBI involved in the investigation were transferred out to other places by orders from ruling politicians. However, the case continued to make headlines in the newspapers media, as it was pursued by a few journalists.\n\nOn 4 October 1993, writ petitions were filed at the Supreme court of India, in the public interest under Article 32 of the Constitution of the India. These contained allegations that Government agencies like the CBI and the revenue authorities had failed to perform their duties and legal obligations as they had \"failed to investigate matters arising out of the seizure of the \"Jan diaries\"; that the apprehension of terrorists had led to the discovery of financial support to them by clandestine and illegal means using tainted funds obtained through `havala' transactions; that this had also disclosed a nexus between politicians, bureaucrats and criminals, who were recipients of money from unlawful sources, given for unlawful consideration that the CBI and other Government agencies had failed to investigate the matter, take it to its logical conclusion and prosecute all persons who were found to have committed and offence; that this was done with a view to protect the persons involved, who were very influential and powerful; that the matter disclosed a nexus between crime and corruption at high places in public life and it posed a serious threat to the integrity, security and economy of the nation; that probity in public life, the rule of law and the preservation of democracy required that the Government agencies the compelled to duly perform their legal obligations and to proceed in accordance with law against every person involved, irrespective of where he was placed in the political hierarchy.\" In India, the Havala method is an illegal method of transacting in foreign currency. It is illegal and contentious due to two reasons. Firstly, it is highly secretive as it does not reveal the identity of people on either side of the transaction, even to the havala operators. Secondly, it violates the FERA regulations of India as it does not use approved channels of regular banks for foreign currency transactions. However, it is often used in India for two reasons. Firstly, to transfer legally earned salaries (example : by ordinary workers overseas in Saudi Arabia and UAE) to their hometowns, as hawala transaction costs are a fraction of banks, and havala operators can be found in the smallest villages of India. Secondly, by politicians, bureaucrats and nefarious elements to transfer corruption money.\n\nThose accused included L. K. Advani, V. C. Shukla, P. Shiv Shankar, Sharad Yadav, Balram Jakhar, and Madan Lal Khurana. The entire list contained politicians from the BJP, Congress and independent MLAs and MPs, with amounts varying between Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 7.5 crore. The prosecution that followed was partly prompted by a public interest petition (see Vineet Narain), and yet the court cases of the Hawala scandal eventually all collapsed without convictions. Many were acquitted in 1997 and 1998, partly because the hawala records (including diaries) were judged in court to be inadequate as the main evidence. The Central Bureau of Investigation's role was criticised. In concluding the Vineet Narain case, the Supreme Court of India directed that the Central Vigilance Commission should be given a supervisory role over the CBI.\n\nThe supreme court proceeding did not relate to the hawala case per se, but rather to the suspicious transfer of the CBI Director Joginder Singh and the rampant misuse of political power to curb the investigations of the CBI and Revenue department. In its judgment, delivered on 18 December 1997, the court, through judges S.P.Bharucha and S.C.Sen gave a ruling consisting of a 26 points list of pronouncements, the most important of which made it impossible for politicians in the government to remove the Director of the CBI for 2 years, thus ensuring that the CBI and its officers would have freedom to carry out their work without political interference.\n\nThe Jain Hawala story was broken by two Delhi-based journalists Ram Bahadur Rai and Rajesh Joshi, working for the Hindi daily Jansatta. Then Vineet Narain, the journalist filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme court of India.\n\n", "id": "7740798", "categories": [], "title": "Hawala scandal"}

Through strategic alliances and global partnerships, ASTC's goal is to increase awareness of the valuable contributions its members make to their communities and the field of informal STEM learning.\n\nFounded in 1973, ASTC now represents approximately 650 members in nearly 50 countries, including not only science centers and museums, but also nature centers, aquariums, planetariums, zoos, botanical gardens, and natural history and children’s museums, as well as companies, consultants, and other organizations that share an interest in informal science education.\n\nScience centers connect people with science, give science a presence in the community and offer people of all ages and backgrounds the opportunity to ask questions, discuss, and explore.\n\nScience centers provide firsthand experience and an opportunity to develop intuitions about the natural world. In science centers, hands-on activities may include things such as feeling infrared radiation and experiencing angular momentum—so when they encounter these concepts in other settings, they’ll be likelier to understand. Many schools rely on science centers for memorable field trips and auditorium programs, hands-on curriculum, science kits, and teacher training.\n\nScience centers also encourage curiosity. In the words of Frank Oppenheimer, founder of San Francisco's Exploratorium, “No one flunks a museum.” For some, the interests awakened by science center experiences have turned into a passion for science, and the beginning of a lifetime devoted to teaching or research.\n\nASTC’s goal is to support these efforts of science centers and museums, in addition to their staff, visitors, and communities.\n\nSome ASTC member institutions also participate in ASTC’s Passport Program. The Passport Program allows members of a participating institution to visit other participating institutions for free, provided the member is visiting an institution more than 90 miles from their home institution. More than 300 institutions in over a dozen countries are currently participating in the Passport Program.\n\nEach year, nearly 2,000 individuals representing science centers and museums from across the world, informal science educators, and companies collaborating with the museum field gather for ASTC’s Annual Conference.\n\nASTC provides professional development opportunities for those who work in science centers and other institutions of informal learning. ASTC’s professional development services include:\n\nCommunities of Practice (CoP) provide informal science education professionals the infrastructure they need to meet the field's challenges from the ground up. ASTC provides CoPs with resources and support for connecting with colleagues, convening meetings, and organizing workshops, among other activities. The current CoPs include:\nComing Soon: Museum Screens\n\nSince 1974, ASTC Exhibition Services has supported excellence and innovation in science exhibitions through collaborations with science centers and other organizations worldwide. They work with partners to support sharing of knowledge and experience, and assist with planning, marketing, and management of traveling exhibitions.\n\nASTC Connect is a learning and resource-sharing area for the informal science education community. Discussion forums, online workshops, and self-paced tutorials are hosted in collaboration with partners from throughout the field.\n\nThe YOUmedia Network is a group of libraries, museums and community-based organizations that invite young people to create, learn, and build skills with traditional and 21st century digital tools. There are currently 24 Learning Lab sites operating across the country with programs that are driven by youth interests and connect learning directly back to school, careers, and other realms.\n\nThe Youth Inspired Challenge is a 3-year initiative designed to expand the impact of science centers and museums to assist the youth around the world to become the innovative and creative thinkers needed for the 21st century workforce. This program was inspired by President Obama and other world leaders’ commitment to strengthening the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics knowledge of today’s youth. To date, more than 100 science centers have joined the challenge.\n\nGirls RISEnet, a partnership between the Miami Science Museum, the Association of Science-Technology Centers, and SECME, Inc., is strengthening the professional capacity of informal science educators to engage and motivate minority girls in grades 6-12 to explore and pursue science and engineering careers.\n\nExhibitFiles is an online community of exhibit practitioners building a shared collection of exhibition records and reviews. It's a place to connect with colleagues, find out about exhibits, and share your own experiences. ExhibitFiles was developed to preserve and share experiences and materials that are often unrecorded, temporary, and hard to locate. Visitors to the site can also search for, and post exhibitions rentals and sales.\n\nASTC and the National Writing Project (NWP) received a grant from the National Science Foundation to design a program that will integrate science and literacy. Through this program, ten partnerships will be created between NWP sites and ASTC-member science centers and museums to develop innovative programs for educators and youth.\n\nASTC publishes a bimonthly magazine titled \"Dimensions\". The magazine features in-depth analysis of news and trends in the science center and museum field, in addition to articles about noteworthy events and resources. \"Dimensions\" readers include directors and staff of ASTC-member institutions around the world, as well as those with an interest in informal science education.\n\nASTC's Legislative Action Center is an easy, online advocacy tool to help the public stay informed of important public policy developments and provide opportunities to get involved in advocacy efforts on behalf of the museum and informal science education fields.\n\nASTC is home to the Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education (CAISE). CAISE's charge is to strengthen and connect the informal science education (ISE) community by creating and disseminating resources, as well as catalyzing conversation and collaboration across the ISE field—including film and broadcast media, science centers and museums, zoos and aquariums, botanical gardens and nature centers, digital media and gaming, science journalism, and youth, community, and after-school programs. Founded in 2007 with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, CAISE is a partnership among ASTC and Co-Principal Investigators at Oregon State University (OSU), the University of Pittsburgh Center for Learning in Out-of-School Environments (UPCLOSE), The Great Lakes Science Center and KQED San Francisco. CAISE manages the InformalScience.org website, which is a growing repository of project descriptions, evaluation reports and tools, and research papers and products that are collected and curated to provide informal STEM Learning practitioners with knowledge that can be used when developing new work and seeking potential collaborators.\n\n", "id": "7740810", "categories": ["International scientific organizations", "1973 establishments in Washington, D.C.", "Science museums", "Organizations established in 1973", "Organizations based in Washington, D.C.", "Technology museums", "Science centers"], "title": "Association of Science-Technology Centers"}

Atan Burhagohain \"Rajmantri Dangaria\" was the Prime Minister of Assam for more than seventeen years, from January 1662 to March 1679. During this period Assam passed through a series of crises in the form of foreign invasions and internal disruptions; and Atan Burhagohain conducted the affairs with rare foresight, probity, judgment, and patriotism. The versatile qualities of the Burhagoain, and the proof that he gave of his lofty and noble ideals, made him the darling of the people. Kings, potentates and the populace were united in showering tokens of their admiration and respect on this man of their country's destiny. Twice the crown was offered to him which he did twice refuse, saying, \"It does not behove a minister to become a monarch; kingship should go to the scion of a royal family, and saintship to the descendant of a saint.\"\n\nHe was appointed as the Prime Minister in January 1662, at the time Garhgaon was occupied by Mir Jumla. He oversaw the military resistance to the Mughal general, negotiated the Treaty of Ghilajharighat, planned the rejuvenation of the Ahom kingdom and was one of the architects of the Ahom victory at the Battle of Saraighat. He was known for his military tactics of guerrilla warfare that came to be known as \"daga juddha\", and also for his statesmanship and wise counsel. He was appointed the \"Rajmantri Dangaria\" (Prime Minister) by the Ahom king Chakradhwaj Singha, and in the turmoil following the excesses of Debera Borbarua, he was offered the Ahom throne itself, which he refused. Despite his wisdom and keen political sense, he was unable to see through the treachery of Laluk Sola Borphukan, and was murdered by the Borphukan's henchmen in 1679.\n\nAccording to the Buranjis, the Burhagohain was tall in stature and his strides resembled that of a goose. His face was broad, and he had two moles on the forehead. He was ruddy in complexion. He wore a buffalo-coloured \"gati\" or a cloth tightly wrapped round the body with two ends made into a knot near the waist and he carried a big hengdang or sword. Since he belonged to the \"Bahgaria\" clan, he is generally referred to as Bahgaria Atan Burhagohain.\n\nAtan Burhagohain was one of the key people in the victory of the Assamese in the Battle of Saraighat. The Prime Minister was personally in charge of the command of the northern division of the Ahom army on the north bank of Guwahati. His camp was situated at Lathia Parvat, and he had with him 80 \"chor-bachas\" or commando soldiers in his \"Pali\" (meaning a unit of command under a commander in Assamese).\n\nFrom his base at Lathia fort, he initiated a campaign of guerrilla attacks on the Mughals, employing many well known commandos: Lai, Lechai, Chili, Mabi, Mari, Achor, Tunai, Baduli, and other spies who entered the enemy's camps at night and removed their treasures, money and disabled their arms.\n\nAtan Burhagohain was also a highly skilled military engineer and after the occupation of Gauhati, he was directed by the King to oversee the construction of the necessary fortifications on both banks of Brahmaputra. Before the final Saraighat battle, on seeing the fortification and preparation of the Ahom army, Raja Ram Singha commented to his lieutenant Rashid Khan:\nThis conversation was communicated to the Ahoms by a traveller named Hangalbhanga Laskar. On hearing this, the Premier Atan Burhagohain promulgated this message to the army:\n\nAtan Burhagohain was not only a highly trained soldier, he was also an able administrator and astute statesman. Immediately upon ascending the throne, King Chakradhwaj Singha was impatient and contemplated immediate attack on the Mughal forces. He pleaded with the King that such attack would be suicidal, that first they should properly train the army, build the armory, stock food provisions and other war material, as the hostilities may continue for a number of years. He addressed the king and his councillors on this occasion:\n\nHe said, “\"sakalo dravyat thaki chaul kotha he prodhan\"” (\"rice is the most indispensable and important of all the items\"). Long before Napoleon stated that \"an Army marches on its stomach\" Atan Burhagohain had realised this and convinced his king to make necessary preparations.\n\nAtan Burhagohain further pleaded,\n\nAtan Burhagohain also advised to have the boatsmen and oarsmen trained:\nThe counsel of Prime Minister Atan Burhagohain roused the monarch to a consciousness of the realities of the situation, and extensive preparation was made for two years before the onslaught on the Mughals.\n\nAfter the reoccupation of Gauhati by the Ahoms, Atan Burhagohain was appointed by the king to erect the necessary fortifications on both banks of Brahmaputra, strengthen them, stock them with provisions and men. Lachit Borphukan was asked to post a contingent of soldiers at each strategic point under an able commander. Under the Premier's supervision, the civil administration of Kamrup was reorganised on sound footing, and Chaudhuris and Patwaries were appointed to realise the stipulated \"jaigiri-dhan\" or land revenue. The administration of the parganas of Kamrup was vested under various senior officers: Barphukan (Darang, Barbhag and Bangeswar), Paniphukan (Khata and Banbhag), Duara Phukan (Pubpar and Paschimpar), Deka Phukan (Sarubangsar and Kachari-mahal), Chetia Phukan (Ramsa and Sarukhetri), Dayangia Rajkhowa (Bar Khetri), Tar-Salagarua Rajkhowa (Barhanti), Dikhowmukhia Rajkhowa (Chamaria), Pani-Salaguria Rajkhowa (Nagarberha), Pani-Dihingia Rajkhowa (Bagaribari), Tarua-Dihingia Rajkhowa (Barpeta), Namdangia Rajkhowa (Barnagar), Pani-Abhoypuria Rajkhowa (Bajali), Bar-Abhoypuria Rajkhowa (Bekeli) and Saru-Abhoypuria Rajkhowa (Bausi).\n\nDuring the war, Raja Ram Singha asked his envoy Panditrai:\nTo this Panditrai replied,\nRam Singha commented, \"It is really wonderful that a man can be so intelligent at this tender age.\" Panditrai added, \"The Burhagohain is also an arch-diplomat.\" Ram Singha concluded, \"Who will be able to cope with such a minister when he comes to years? Pride should be the heritage of that land where such a counsellor has taken his birth.\"\n\n", "id": "7740838", "categories": ["People of the Ahom kingdom", "Indian Army personnel", "1679 deaths"], "title": "Atan Burhagohain"}

The Greasbrough Canal, connecting to the navigation on the boundaries of Rotherham and Parkgate, was opened in 1780 to serve the Marquess's interests, and the wagonways from his coal pits at Bassingthorpe were diverted to the canal head. Two years later, the Marquess died, and the estate passed to his nephew, Earl Fitzwilliam.\n\nThe Earl owned coal pits at High Stubbin and Swallow Wood, and these pits were, from the early 19th century, joined by a wagonway to the Greasbrough Canal. In 1839, the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway opened a branch from its main line at Holmes, which had been opened the previous year, to join with the Earl's railway at Parkgate. This line ran alongside the construction works of the North Midland Railway before joining the canal bank. This connection broke the near monopoly of the Duke of Norfolk's estate in supplying coal to the developing industries of the city and gave the Earl's coal a competitive edge in the marketplace. \n\nIn 1840, the estate bought a six-coupled steam locomotive for use on the line, and to accommodate this, the wagonway was rebuilt.\n\nA connection was made from the North Midland Railway to the Earl's line, which rendered the branch from Holmes redundant. This connection was closed in 1977, a year before New Stubbin Colliery itself. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway constructed a line from Rotherham Road alongside the canal and below the North Midland line to reach the canal head. The line opened in 1873, and the agreement between the Earl's Colliery Company and the M.S.& L. terminated on 31 December 1978 when the line closed. \n\nIn 1915 Viscount Halifax invested heavily into improvement of the rail line.\n\nThe line can be divided into two sections, both originally rope-worked. The lower section serving New Stubbin Colliery, sunk between 1913 and 1915, changed to locomotive working.\n\nIts last steam locomotives were two examples built by Hudswell Clarke & Co. of Leeds: No. 34, an outside cylinder, six-coupled side tank locomotive, works No.1523, built in 1925 and delivered new to the Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company in Scunthorpe, which came to the line in the 1950s; and No. 37, an outside cylinder, six-coupled saddle tank. They worked until the mid-1960s, when the line became fully dieselised, Hudswell Clarke again supplying the power.\n\n\n", "id": "7740851", "categories": ["Rail transport in South Yorkshire"], "title": "Earl Fitzwilliam's private railway"}

He spent three months in King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, England, transferring afterward to another nine months of bedrest at home. Stevens, who was near death at the time he was admitted in the hospital, used the time he was recuperating for contemplation, and wrote dozens of songs, including \"Trouble\", many of which were recorded much later. \n\nWhen he was hospitalized, Stevens was often alone in a very spare and plain room. He was told that at the time he was admitted, he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him. The effect on the 19-year-old pop star was pronounced. He said, \"To go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut.\" The song itself shows Stevens switching from heavily orchestrated pop music to a folk-rock emphasis.\n\nWhile recovering, Stevens donated his spare time, and some of his newer, more introspective songs for Colin Higgins and Hal Ashby's 1971 film soundtrack of \"Harold and Maude\". Most of the tunes used for the movie appear on Stevens's next albums, \"Mona Bone Jakon\" and \"Tea for the Tillerman\", with the exception of two songs which were not released until the release of the album \"\" in 1984, \"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\" and \"Don't Be Shy\".\n\nIn \"Harold and Maude\" the song \"Trouble\" is used in the scene of Maude's impending death, with her devoted young lover heartbroken over the turn of events. \n\n\n", "id": "7740911", "categories": ["Songs about suicide", "1970 songs", "Songs written by Cat Stevens", "Cat Stevens songs"], "title": "Trouble (Cat Stevens song)"}

Dinny Meehan was described by the police as \"the most desperate gang leader in Brooklyn.\" \n\nBorn in Brooklyn, Meehan apparently joined the White Hand Gang in his late teens. In 1912, he was arrested for shooting and killing Chris Maroney, who led a faction of White Handers from the Navy Yard section of Brooklyn. After a sensational trial, Meehan was acquitted, adding to his criminal reputation. Over the years he had served time in the Elmira Reformatory, Blackwell's Island, and the City Workhouse. Dinny often boasted that he would never see the inside of a state penitentiary. \n\nUnlike some crime bosses, Dinny Meehan often joined his men on criminal jobs. By 1920, there were a total of three cases pending against him; he was out of jail on a $5,000 bond for robbing a man on Fifth Avenue, leading his men in the hijacking of a truckload of shoes worth $10,000, and overseeing the theft of $10,000 worth of silk from a Red Hook warehouse.\n\nOn the afternoon of March 31, 1920, Dinny Meehan and his wife Sadie were asleep in bed at their apartment at 452 Warren Street in Red Hook. Their four-year-old son played in the living room while Sadie's mother, Rose Leighton, dozed in a recliner. Neither of them knew that five strange men were in the apartment until the last second. As the men made for the bedroom, the young boy admonished them not to wake his parents. The leader of the group playfully patted the youngster's head and said they just wanted to look in. A total of five shots were fired; one passed through Dinny Meehan's head and then lodged in the shoulder of his wife, who later recovered from her wounds. The gunmen dashed from the building and made their escape in an automobile truck. \n\nMeehan's murder has been traditionally thought to have been arranged by Brooklyn Black Hand boss Frankie Yale and carried out by Yale's underboss, Augie Pisano, and two hitmen from Cleveland, Ralph DeSarno and Giovanni Sciacca. At the time of the killing, however, police believed that a possible motive was the gang leader's role in supplying strikebreakers to take the places of employees of the United Fruit Company on piers along the Hudson and East Rivers. These employees had recently walked out when their demands for higher wages were turned down. The arrest of a Frank Madden, an associate of the International Longshoremen's Association Local 856 and his subsequent plea of Not Guilty for the charge of Meehan's murder confirms this. It was also rumored that there was internal strife in the White Hand Gang. Just before his murder, Meehan was acquitted in a robbery case while one of his henchman, Edward Gilchrist, was convicted. Dinny was said to have \"double-crossed\" Gilchrist, causing resentment within his gang. Sadie Meehan told police in November 1923 that her husband's killer was, in fact, Wild Bill Lovett, head of the arch-rival Jay Street Gang. Meehan's murder has remained officially unsolved.\n", "id": "7740978", "categories": ["Murdered American mobsters of Irish descent", "American mobsters of Irish descent", "Elmira Correctional Facility", "People from Red Hook, Brooklyn", "American mob bosses", "Gang members of New York City", "1889 births", "People murdered in New York (state)", "1920 deaths", "Deaths by firearm in New York (state)"], "title": "Dinny Meehan"}

These robots are modeled after the Hulk.\n\nThe first Hulk Robot first appeared in \"The Incredible Hulk\" #4, created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee.\n\nThe second Hulk Robot first appeared in \"Eternals\" #14, by Jack Kirby.\n\nThe first Hulk Robot was a simulacrum created by the scientists at Gamma Base that was used to test the value of the Iceberg Rocket that General Thunderbolt Ross had his scientists create.\n\nA later model of the Hulk Robot was operated by a remote that is worn by an individual at a safe distance. During the time he was cured of his gamma-radiation condition, Bruce Banner donned the harness in order to fight Leader during his takeover of Gamma Base. Although the Hulk Robot fought Leader's Murder Module, it was destroyed in battle where the feedback nearly killed Bruce Banner.\n\nAnother version of the military's Hulk Robot came into the possession of the magician Kropotkin the Great during one of his visits to Gamma Base. Even though he hasn't been to Gamma Base for a while, Kropotkin the Great still owns this Hulk Robot.\n\nRusty and Arthur are two Maryland Institute of Technology students who constructed a Hulk robot to be the mascot for their school's all-star game, but Dr. Timothy Ryan considered it dangerous and wouldn't allow it. It was brought to life by cosmic energies released by the Eternals from Olympia when they emerged from the Uni-Mind. The energies granted the Hulk Robot sentience and increased its strength to rival the Hulk. It broke out of the lab and went on a rampage. When the National Guard couldn't stop the Hulk Robot, three Eternals members (Ikaris, Makkari, and Sersi) were called in. Both the Eternals and National Guard were losing until Zuras entered the fray. When it charged Zuras, cosmic energies leaked and it was rendered inert.\n\nLater on, Doctor Doom found the Hulk Robot and dismantled and rebuilt it to serve him. He sent it to fight the Thing who thought it was the real Hulk after taking out the Grey Hulk. When Thing discovered it wasn't the real Hulk during battle, he tore it apart.\n\nDuring the \"Acts of Vengeance\" event, Doctor Doom gave Jester II the Hulk Robot's parts and Jester rebuilt it (with the addition of humorous weapons in its arsenal) as a member of the Assembly of Evil. During the Avengers' press conference, the Hulk Robot attacked She-Hulk and had her on the ropes until Wasp attacked the Jester's remote control causing the Hulk Robot to go haywire. She-Hulk destroyed it by flinging it into an energy blast fired by Fenris.\n\nThe Hulk Robot (or the non-operating version) was seen in a museum the Eternals kept in Olympia which held reminders of foes and their weapons. Zuras displayed the robot to Joey Eliot.\n\nDuring the \"Fall of the Hulks\" storyline, the Hulk Robot returned. When Galactus created the Cosmos Automaton to serve him as part of a later retelling of the Hulk Robot's origin as shown on the extraterrestrial disk, he abandoned it during a visit to one of the worlds that he would consume causing it to seek a new form for its body. After influencing Professor Gregson Gilbert into creating Dragon Man and finding it not to be a suitable candidate, it then influenced Mad Thinker into creating a Hulk Robot. Even though he didn't know why he created, Mad Thinker had it locked away. After the extraterrestrial disk was done showing this to Red Hulk and A-Bomb, Red Hulk considered decapitating it only for the Hulk Robot to activate upon absorbing the cosmic energy that was used to empower Red Hulk. This was all part of Leader and MODOK's plan to siphon the energy. Bruce Banner, Red Hulk, and A-Bomb looked at the enemies that they were facing and found a holographic shot of the Hulk Robot. Leader (alongside the other Intelligencia members) managed to obtain the Hulk Robot. The Leader used it to attack former member Doctor Doom when Skaar attacks. Doctor Doom fell victim to the Hulk Robot's \"Poison Pill\" when Bruce Banner arrived. The Leader then had the Hulk Robot carry away Doctor Doom.\n\nHulk Robot later helped MODOK and the Mad Thinker's Gammadroid subdue Red Hulk.\n\nRed Hulk later drains the Gamma Energy from the Hulk Robot and rips it apart.\n\nIn a Marvel/DC crossover featuring Superman confronting the Hulk, Lex Luthor created another robot version of the Hulk to frame the Hulk for the capture of Betty Ross. After the Hulk attacked the robot, Superman was tricked into fighting the Green Goliath, resulting in Luthor attempting to kill them both with Bruce Banner's gamma gun unaware or unconcerned that the gun could kill everybody within five hundred miles. The two heroes put aside their differences and destroyed the gun.\n\nThe Hulk Robot appeared in the \"Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends\" episode \"Spidey Goes Hollywood.\" This version was created by Mysterio to destroy Spider-Man in a movie being made by Sam Blockbuster, but it got destroyed when the real Hulk interfered.\n\n", "id": "7740990", "categories": ["Marvel Comics robots", "Characters created by Jack Kirby", "Comics characters introduced in 1977"], "title": "Hulk Robot"}

It is held as a sacred spot for Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists.\nThere are three Buddhist monasteries at Riwalsar. The lake also has three Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Krishna, Lord Shiva and to the sage Lomas. Another holy lake, Kunt Bhyog which is about 1,750 m above sea level lies above Rewalsar. It is associated with the escape of 'Pandavas' from the burning palace of wax—an episode from the epic \"Mahabharata\".\n\nIt was from here that the Indian teacher and 'Tantric' Padmasambhava left for Tibet. Known to the Tibetans as 'Guru Rinpoche', the Precious Master, it was under Padmasambhava's influence that Mahayana Buddhism spread over Tibet. There are islands of floating reed on Rewalsar lake and the spirit of Padmasambhava is said to reside in them. It is here that the sage Lomas did penance in devotion to Lord Shiva, and the Sikh guru Gobind Singh (22 December 1666 – 7 October 1708), the tenth Guru of Sikhism, also resided here for one month.\n\nThe Sisu fair held in late February/early march, and the festival of Baisakhi are important events at Rewalsar.\n\nMandarava and Padmasambhava were energetically drawn to one another.

Instead of finding their corpses incensed and charred, Vihardhara finds that the fire of the pyre has been transformed into Lake Rewalsar, out of which arises a blooming lotus that supports the unharmed Mandarava and Padmasambhava who through this manifestation of their realisation have achieved their secret names of Vajravarahi and Hayagriva, respectively, after which Vihardhara furnishes the union with his unreserved blessings.\n\nLegend has it that the great teacher Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche) used his enormous power to take flight to Tibet from Rewalsar. In Rewalsar, his spirit is said to reside in the tiny island of floating reed that drifts over the water.\n\nOn April 1, 2012, a monumental statue of Padmasambhava, measuring 37.5 m (123 ft), was consecrated, blessed and inaugurated by the 14th Dalai Lama. The building project was spear-headed and overseen by Wangdor Rinpoche and funded by donations. It took nearly 10 years to complete, with the foundation alone taking three years. \n\nThe statue was constructed almost entirely by hand by tradespeople from the immediate Rewalsar area and by master artists from Nepal and Bhutan. It is made primarily of cement, layered by hand over a skeleton of iron rebar, while the walls are made of hand-cut stone. Bhutanese sculptors carved intricate details into the cement while still wet. It was then painted by masters from Nepal, who finished the delicate details by hand.

He attended the Mount Pleasant Classical Institute in Amherst, Massachusetts, and Amherst College. He moved with his father to Philadelphia in 1837. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1840. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1842 and commenced practice in Philadelphia.\n\nThayer was a commissioner to revise the revenue laws of Pennsylvania in 1862. He was elected as a Republican to the Thirty-eighth and Thirty-ninth Congresses, during which he served on the committee on the bankrupt law and was the chairman of the United States House Committee on Private Land Claims. He declined to be a candidate for re-election in 1866, and resumed the practice of law.\n\nWhile in Congress, Thayer criticized the use of portraits of living persons on US currency, suggesting that the Treasury's privilege of portrait selection for currency was being abused.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741076", "text": "American game show winnings records\n\nIn the United States, a game show is a type of radio, television, or internet program in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering trivia questions and/or solving puzzles, usually for money and/or prizes. Game shows are usually distinguishable from reality television competition shows, in which the competition consumes an entire season of episodes; in a game show, prizes can typically be won in a single match (in some cases, particularly in the ones that offer record-setting prizes, contestants can play multiple matches and accumulate a larger total). Beginning with the first five-figure and six-figure game show jackpots in the mid-1950s, a succession of contestants on various quiz shows of the era each set records. Terry Nadler of \"The $64,000 Challenge\", the highest-scoring contestant of the 1950s era, was not surpassed until 1980, when Thom McKee won $312,700 on \"Tic-Tac-Dough.\" Between 1999 and 2001, during a brief boom in high-stakes game shows, the record was broken six times. Both the 1955–1958 and 1999–2001 eras of rapidly set and broken records were driven primarily by one-upmanship between the networks each trying to secure bragging rights and ratings by inflating their prize offerings, rather than the merits of the contestants themselves. , Brad Rutter is the highest-earning American game show contestant of all time, having accumulated a total of $4,888,436. He succeeded Ken Jennings as the highest-earning contestant (a record he had held since 2004) by virtue of his victory on May 16, 2014 in the \"Jeopardy!\" Battle of the Decades tournament. American daytime television has historically had smaller prize budgets for game shows that air in that daypart.\n\nMost daytime game show top prizes were limited to $25,000 during the 1960s and 1970s, a restriction made for both budgetary concerns and to assuage criticism that arose from the 1950s quiz show scandals. The single day record for shows in daytime television was set by Michael Larson in 1984, who won $110,237 () on \"Press Your Luck.\" Larson achieved this record by memorizing the show's board patterns, repeatedly hitting the board's squares that awarded contestants money and an additional spin, which would, in turn, replace the spin he had just used, effectively allowing him to spin the board in the second round as long as he wanted. Because of this, his game had to be split into two episodes (which aired June 8 and June 11), as his turn caused the game to go well over the show's half-hour allotted time. At the time of the show's airing, CBS only allowed contestants to win up to $50,000 on a game show (contestants would retire after winning $25,000); the winnings limit increased to $75,000 in November and $100,000 in 1986 (and later $125,000 by 1990) before being permanently eliminated in 2006. In March 2003, Game Show Network produced a documentary about the event featuring Ed Long and Janie Litras-Dakan, the contestants Larson handily defeated in 1984. \n\nIn 2006, Larson was succeeded by Vickyann Chrobak-Sadowski, who set the record by winning $147,517 on the 35th season premiere of \"The Price Is Right\", winning a Dodge Caravan playing \"Push Over\", $1,000 cash and both showcases. In 2013, Chrobak-Sadowski was succeeded by Sheree Heil, who set the record by winning $170,345 on \"The Price Is Right\" \"Best of 2013\" special, winning an Audi R8 playing \"Gas Money\", $10,000 cash and Prada shoes. In 2016, Heil was succeeded by Christen Freeman, who set the record by winning $210,000 on October 28, during the show's \"Big Money Week\" special. As Cliff Hangers was the episode's Big Money game, game rules were modified to offer a top prize of $250,000, which was reduced by $10,000 for every step the mountain climber took. In addition to her One Bid prize and an additional $1,000 won during the Showcase Showdown, Freeman's grand total was $212,879, setting a new daytime record.\n\nDuring the early quiz show boom of the mid-1950s, Joyce Brothers set the first winnings record by winning the title prize on \"The $64,000 Question\" in 1955 despite producers attempting to give her questions they thought she could not answer. Herb Stempel set the next winnings record of $69,500 on \"Twenty One\" before being defeated by Charles Van Doren, who won $129,000 on the same show. Within weeks of Van Doren's victory. Teddy Nadler set a record during the 1956–1957 television season that would stand for the next two decades, winning $264,000 () on \"The $64,000 Challenge\". The quiz show scandals of 1958 and 1959 prompted the cancellation of most of the big-budget game shows and the imposition of strict limits on prize amounts, which meant that through the 1960s and 1970s, game show contestants could not match their 1950s counterparts. Stempel openly admitted the fraud after his defeat, though Van Doren insisted he had wanted to do the show honestly and refused to speak on the topic for decades afterward. Though Nadler's win did not draw enough suspicion to warrant sanctions against him, he was exposed as a likely fraud when he failed a civil service exam trying to get a temporary job with the United States Census Bureau. It was not until the summer of 1980 that Nadler's record fell, when a U.S. Naval officer named Thom McKee began a run on \"Tic-Tac-Dough\" that carried over into the following season. Since champions on \"Tic Tac Dough\" played until they were defeated (similar to that of \"Jeopardy!\" beginning with the 2003–2004 season) and games on the show could end in ties with the pot carrying over, McKee was able to keep building his total as long as he kept playing and winning. McKee won $312,700 () in cash and prizes in 43 games, which included eight cars (on \"Tic Tac Dough\" and its sister show, \"The Joker's Wild,\" a contestant automatically won a car after every fifth game they won). While McKee was the biggest solo winner until 1999, nine couples on \"The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime\" won the show's top prize of $1,000,000 in a combination of prizes and a long-term annuity, during the show's run in syndication from January 1986 to September 1987. However, this program had no solo players.\n\nIn 1999, McKee was passed by Michael Shutterly, who was the biggest winner in the first season of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" in the United States. Shutterly was the first contestant on the show to get to the 15th and final question, but elected to walk instead with $500,000 which made him the biggest winner in American game show history at the time. Shutterly had previously won $49,200 as a four-day champion on \"Jeopardy!\" in 1988, making his career winnings total $549,200. On November 19, during the second season of \"Millionaire\" in the United States, the show crowned its first million-dollar winner when John Carpenter won the show's top prize without using any lifelines, save for a phone call on the final question, when he told tell his father he was going to win the million dollars. After Carpenter answered the final question, which concerned Richard Nixon's appearance on \"Laugh-In\" in 1968, host Regis Philbin proclaimed Carpenter the show's (and worldwide format's) first top-prize winner. Carpenter's record remained intact until the following year. In early 2000, Rahim Oberholtzer, a contestant on the revival of NBC's \"Twenty One,\" won four games in his appearances on the show, along with $120,000 in the show's \"Perfect 21\" bonus round, for a total of $1,120,000. For surpassing Carpenter's mark, then-host Maury Povich proclaimed Oberholtzer \"the TV Game Show King\". Late in its run, the Fox game show \"Greed\" brought back some of its previous winners to try for an extra $1,000,000. Curtis Warren, who was part of the first \"team\" to win $1,000,000 on the show (of which his share was $400,000, plus $10,000 for winning a terminator round), was one of the contestants brought back to do so on February 11, 2000. Warren was given a question about TV shows that had been made into movies, with eight choices (of which he had to identify the four correct answers). He successfully did so, giving himself $1,410,000 and the record for the time being. Warren's record was even shorter lived than Oberholtzer's had been, lasting only four days. Three days before Warren's win, David Legler, who also appeared on \"Twenty One,\" began a run as champion on the show. Four days after Warren's win, the run continued, with Legler having earned a grand total of $1,765,000 in six wins to surpass Warren's record and become the third contestant in two months to top $1,000,000 on a game show. \n\nLegler held the record for well over a year, outlasting \"Twenty One\" itself: by July 2000, the million-dollar game show boom had gone bust and both \"Greed\" and \"Twenty One\" (along with several others) were cancelled, leaving \"Millionaire\" as the last surviving million-dollar game show on American television from that boom; it would not be until April 2001 (with the arrival of \"Weakest Link\") that another would be attempted. By the start of 2001, the producers of \"Millionaire\" decided that it had been too long (71 episodes over a five-month period) since their top prize had been won and instituted an accumulating jackpot which added $10,000 to the grand prize amount for each episode it was not won. Kevin Olmstead claimed the top prize on April 10, 2001, winning a jackpot of $2,180,000. Olmstead became the first contestant to top $2,000,000 in total winnings on a game show and supplanted Legler as the all-time leader. In 2004, ABC launched an ultra high-stakes version of \"Millionaire\" entitled \"Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire\" with a $10,000,000 top prize. Two separate \"Super Millionaire\" series aired, one in February and a second in May. However, despite the higher stakes and the potential for someone to top the all-time record for winnings, the largest prize awarded was $1,000,000, won by Robert Essig.\n\nOne week after \"Super Millionaire\" came to an end, Ken Jennings of Salt Lake City, Utah became the new champion on \"Jeopardy!\" The episode, which was broadcast on June 2, was the first in a long winning streak for the software engineer, made possible due to a change at the beginning of that season (the show's twentieth on air in syndication), eliminating the longstanding rule limiting consecutive appearances for a champion to five. With no limit to his appearances, Jennings began to break many game show records. As his streak continued deeper into the 21st season, Jennings was inching closer and closer to Olmstead's record. On November 16, 2004, Jennings topped Olmstead's \"Millionaire\" winnings with his 65th consecutive win, finishing the day with $45,099 and a new cumulative total of $2,197,000 (). Jennings won nine more games before his streak came to an end on November 30, 2004 at the hands of contestant Nancy Zerg. He had extended his record total to $2,520,700 at the time of his defeat, after which he was awarded an additional $2,000 for finishing in second place per \"Jeopardy!\" rules. Shortly after Jennings's defeat, \"Jeopardy!\" decided to see how he would fare in tournament play. On February 9, 2005, the show launched its Ultimate Tournament of Champions, inviting back 144 other past champions to compete over the next three months in a five-round single-elimination tournament with a $2,000,000 grand prize. The field included the highest-winning five-time champions and winners of some previous tournaments, though not all invitees were able to participate. Jennings received a bye into the finals of the tournament, where he faced semi-final winners Jerome Vered and Brad Rutter in a three-game, cumulative total match. Vered had set a single-day scoring record during his appearance on the show in 1992, while Rutter had won the 2001 Tournament of Champions and the 2002 Million Dollar Masters tournament and was the show's highest-earning contestant of all-time before Jennings. In the tournament's three-day final, Rutter defeated Jennings and Vered to win the tournament and $2,000,000, supplanting Jennings as the winningest all time American game show contestant in the process. Including the $1.18 million he had won in his previous \"Jeopardy!\" appearances (five regular season games, a Tournament of Champions win, the Million Dollar Masters win, and three matches in the earlier rounds of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions), Rutter's total stood at $3,255,102, while Jennings was now second with $3,022,700 having gained an additional $500,000 for his second-place finish in the tournament. Jennings slowly began to chip away at Rutter's record, first by winning $714.29 in 2006 as part of the Mob on NBC's \"1 vs. 100.\" A year later, Jennings won the \"Grand Slam\" tournament on Game Show Network and the $100,000 top prize by defeating Ogi Ogas in the final round. Finally, on October 10, 2008, Jennings passed Rutter by winning $500,000 on \"Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?\"; he extended the record by winning $300,000 in The IBM Challenge, where he and Rutter took on IBM supercomputer Watson in a special \"Jeopardy!\" event in 2011. Rutter won $200,000 in the challenge, in which both he and Jennings pledged half of their winnings to charity. Rutter then added $100,000 more when he appeared on \"Million Dollar Mind Game\", raising his total to $3,555,102, second only to Jennings's $3,923,414.29. In 2014, Jennings and Rutter were both invited to play in the \"Jeopardy!\" Battle of the Decades, a tournament conducted by the producers of \"Jeopardy!\" to celebrate its thirtieth season in syndication. Both men advanced to the two-day tournament final with Roger Craig (who had set the previous single-day winnings record of $77,000 in 2010) filling the third position. Needing a win to reclaim his record, Rutter took the top prize in the tournament after Jennings, who needed to answer the second day's Final Jeopardy clue correctly to win (after making a sufficient wager), failed to do so. Rutter won the top prize of $1,000,000 while Jennings won the $100,000 second prize. Jennings appeared on \"Millionaire\" in November 2014. Winning the top prize was the only way he could reclaim the record from Rutter; however, he finished with only $100,000, leaving him in second place. He was then a contestant on the ABC primetime show \"500 Questions\" in 2016; however, as he only lasted four questions, he was unable to add to his total. Both Jennings and Rutter competed in the \"Jeopardy!\" All-Star Games in 2019. Under the format of that tournament, teams of three competed in a relay to win a $1,000,000 top prize split between them. Thus, either Jennings or Rutter would be able to add up to $333,333.33 to their total as captain of their respective team if they won. It would not have been enough for Jennings to surpass Rutter. But it was Rutter's team who won the tournament, with Jennings's team finishing second and splitting $300,000.\n\nNBC's \"The Million Second Quiz\" artificially inflated its grand prize to allow for Andrew Kravis, the winner of the ten-day tournament, to claim a record for most money won on a single game show in regular play. Kravis had only won $2,326,346 during actual play ($326,346 during the game, plus the $2,000,000 grand prize) but was awarded $2,600,000 solely so the show could lay claim to the record. Factoring overall winnings, which includes a $50,500 win on \"Wheel of Fortune\" and two consolation prizes for losing on \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", Kravis's total sits in third as of 2019.\n\nA month after the \"Jeopardy!\" All-Star Games came to an end, James Holzhauer became the new \"Jeopardy!\" champion. The episode, which was broadcast on April 4, 2019, was the first in what is an ongoing winning streak where he joined Jennings and Rutter as the only contestants in \"Jeopardy!\" history to win at least $1,000,000 (as of the episode broadcast on April 23) and $2,000,000 (as of the episode broadcast on May 24). He also surpassed Roger Craig's \"Jeopardy!\" single-day winnings (on multiple occasions), pushing the record to $131,127 on the episode broadcast on April 17. In 2014, Holzhauer won $58,333.33 on \"The Chase\". , currently ranks fourth in total game show earnings. \"Jeopardy!\" finished taping its 35th season in April 2019 and will not finish broadcasting those episodes until July 2019, and thus Holzhauer may have already won more money in episodes that have yet to air.\n", "id": "7741076", "categories": ["American game shows"], "title": "American game show winnings records"}

A version of the song with English lyrics entitled \"I Wish You Love\" is recognizable by the opening line \"I wish you bluebirds, in the spring\".\n\nThis song was first recorded by the French female singer Lucienne Boyer in 1942 (78 rpm, Columbia Records: BF 68). Second recorded by the French crooner Roland Gerbeau in February 1943 (78 rpm, Polydor Records: 524.830). Charles Trenet recorded his own version in July 1943 (78 rpm Columbia Records: DF 3116).\n\nIt was used extensively in the François Truffaut film \"Stolen Kisses\" (1968), its French title, \"Baisers volés\", having been taken from the song's lyrics. The song was also used in the films \"Iris\" (2001), \"Something's Gotta Give\" (2003) and \"Ces amours-là\" (2010).\n\nThe song is best known to English-speaking audiences as \"I Wish You Love\", with new lyrics by American composer and lyricist, Albert Askew Beach (1924- 1997): introduced in 1957 by Keely Smith as the title cut of her solo debut album, \"I Wish You Love\" would become one of Smith's signature songs. Smith's debut album otherwise consisted of standards: she would recall: \"[when] we sat down to select the songs [record producer] Voyle Gilmore...played a bunch of standards [then] said: 'I want to play you a really pretty French song...it won't mean nothing and you won't do it in the album but I just thought I'd play it for you' and he played 'I Wish You Love'. So, at the end of him playing all these songs...I said: 'Babe, I'll sing any 11 songs y'all want me to but I want to sing 'I Wish You Love'.\"\n\nIt has since become a standard, with many other recordings. Gloria Lynne's 1963 recording for the Everest label reached #28 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1964, also top #10 on the Easy Listening chart (edited from the Hot 100), and #3 on Cashbox Magazine's R&B chart (Billboard did not publish standard R&B listings during 1964).\n\nOther versions of the song were recorded by Dalida in 1972 and by Rony Verbiest in 2001.

It is likely that the music was introduced to The Maldives by sailors from the Indian Ocean region. It may be said that \"Boduberu\" first made an appearance in The Maldives in the 11th Century AD, or possibly before that. \nBoduberu is performed by about 20 people, including three drummers and a lead singer. They are accompanied by a small bell, a set of drums also known as a \"bodu beru\", and an \"onugandu\" - a small piece of bamboo with horizontal grooves, from which raspy sounds are produced by scraping. The songs may be of heroism, romance or satire. The prelude to the song is a slow beat with emphasis on drumming, and dancing. As the song reaches a crescendo, one or two dancers maintain the wild beat with their frantic movements ending in some cases in a trance.\n\nThe costume of the performers is a sarong and a white short sleeved shirt.\n\nBoduberu evolved among the common citizens as an alternative to court music. In the early days, the people gathered together to perform Boduberu, and it became widely accepted as the music of the common people. The performing of the music is often referred as \"vibrating the island\". A notable point about Boduberu is its noise and sometimes meaningless lyrics sung. The lyrics do not have a meaning, because it consists of a mixture of local, neighbouring and some African words. Today, meaningful songs written in the local language Dhivehi are sung to the rhythm of Boduberu.\n\nBoduberu is usually sung after a hard day's work. The location is up to the performers. Today, Boduberu is an important item of entertainment at stage shows, celebrations and festivals.\n\nThe \"bodu beru\" is a Maldivian drum, made of wood from coconut tree trunk, and often grouped in trios.

In the mid 19th century, local government reforms replaced the ancient provinces by new Counties (\"shires\"), aligned to sheriffdom boundaries. As the sheriff for Strathgryffe had based himself in Renfrew, the county was called \"county of Renfrew\".\n\nA Strath is a wide glen. The term is rendered in Scots Gaelic as 'Srath' and in the ancient Modern Welsh as 'Ystrad'.\n\n'Stragrif' is mentioned in the 1169 charter of Paisley Abbey, which placed the churches of the area under the control of the new abbey.

He received a liberal preparatory schooling and attended the Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio. He moved to Pennsylvania and settled in Reno, Pennsylvania and engaged in mercantile pursuits. He also became interested in the development of oil in Venango County, Pennsylvania, and the establishment of national banks in thirteen cities throughout the East.\n\nHe was elected as a Republican to the Thirty-ninth Congress. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1866. While a member of Congress, he became bankrupt and was imprisoned in 1866 but was eventually acquitted after a long trial. He resumed operations in the oil business, with headquarters in Franklin, Pennsylvania. He died while on a business trip in Philadelphia in 1909. He was interred in Franklin Cemetery in Franklin, Pennsylvania.\n\nCulver had made a small profit in Logan, Ohio by investing some bank money in oil. He took that money and began buying up banks throughout the oil region. He bought land two miles below Oil City, Pennsylvania where he established the town of Reno and The Reno Oil and Land Company and starting selling stock in what appears to have been a basic pyramid scheme.\n\nCulver also attempted to establish the Reno-Pithole railroad, to run between Reno and Pithole, Pennsylvania, the leading oil boom town at the time. Culver was not one for half measures—to run the railroad he hired Ambrose Burnside, and to hook investors, he brought deep-pocketed men of wealth from all over the country to tour his as-yet-non-existent oil fields.\n\nUltimately Culver's plan collapsed and he was pursued by creditors and courts up and down the oil region. The collapse of his banks triggered a financial panic throughout the oil region that drove many oilmen out of the business and created chaos that set the stage for men like John D. Rockefeller to move in.\n\nA more complete and colorful account of Culver's career can be found in the book The Great Oildorado by Hildegarde Dolson.\n\n", "id": "7741353", "categories": ["1909 deaths", "Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania", "1830 births", "People from Logan, Ohio", "Ohio Wesleyan University alumni", "Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives", "Pennsylvania Republicans"], "title": "Charles Vernon Culver"}

The railway is managed by a non-profit organization, which runs from March to December between the towns of the Baie de Somme area: Le Crotoy and Cayeux-sur-Mer via Noyelles-sur-Mer and Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, on metre gauge tracks (formerly part of Société générale des chemins de fer économiques). The association was founded in 1970 and over the years it has become a major player in tourism development in the Picardy coast and is also responsible for the preservation, safeguarding and enhancement of the fleet full of cars, wagons, steam locomotives and diesel locomotives. The line is one of the closest French heritage lines to the UK, Noyelles is from Boulogne-sur-Mer and from Calais. A part of the line has dual gauge track, and although forming part of a group of five lines, at least a part of it has always been open to traffic.\n\nA branch to Saint-Valery had been proposed as early as 1845. In 1853 the Chemin de Fer du Nord was granted permission to build a single track branch from Noyelles to Saint-Valery. This long line crossed the River Dien by means of a long wooden trestle bridge. The original passenger station at Saint-Valery stood at the site later occupied by Saint-Valery Canal station. The line opened to traffic on 5 June 1858. It was 1885 before the CF du Nord was able to get permission to use steam locomotives at Saint-Valery's docks, horse power having to be used before them.\n\nIn the 1880s, there were various schemes to build narrow gauge lines of either or metre gauge in the Somme département. Eventually, a metre gauge line nearly long was built by the Société générale des chemins de fer économiques (SE) from Noyelles to Le Crotoy, opening on 1 July 1887. A second metre gauge line opened on 6 September 1887 from Noyelles to Cayeux, from Noyelles, with stations at Saint-Valery Ville and Lanchères-Pendé. The line between Noyelles and Saint-Valery being laid between the rails of the standard gauge branch, which was also extended into Saint-Valery Ville. The line between Noyelles and Saint-Valery kept its \"Intérêt Général\" status, and the other lines had \"Intérêt Local\" status, with separate tickets being issued for each part of the route.\n\nThe railway carried holiday-makers to seaside resorts, and transporting local freight of galets, sugar beet, chicory and shellfish. Running around the entire length of the Somme Bay in the Somme \"département\", in Picardy, northern France, it connected Le Crotoy with Noyelles-sur-Mer, Saint-Valery-sur-Somme and Cayeux-sur-Mer, including the sands at Brighton-Plage. Other minor stations or halts were provided near assorted villages, hamlets and farms. In its literature, the operating Association claims that past passengers have included Colette, Jules Verne, Anatole France, and Toulouse-Lautrec.\n\nThese lines, with two others were grouped together as the Réseau des Bains de Mer. The other two lines were one from Noyelles to Forest-l'Abbaye and one from Abbeville to Dompierre-sur-Authie, which had a junction with the line from Noyelles at Forest-l'Abbaye. The Réseau des Bains de Mer was a part of the .\n\nThe CFBS line was affected by three wars; The Franco-Prussian War, the First World War and the Second World War.\n\nFrance declared war on Prussia on 19 July 1870. Saint-Valery was a strategic port, and thus its capture was an objective of the Prussians. In October 1870 the French requisitioned Jules Verne's boat \"Saint-Michel I\" for the defence of the Baie de Somme. The boat was crewed by Crimean War veterans. In December 1870 horses and equipment were requisitioned for use by the French cavalry. A consignment of six hundred saddles left Saint-Valery by train for Noyelles on the 30 December. The Prussians occupied Saint-Valery from February 1871 until September 1873.\n\nThe CFBS line was particularly involved towards the end of the First World War, starting with Operation Michael on 21 March 1918. It was realised that the German advance threatened the Allies' ability to use railways in the area, and that there was a lack of line capacity in certain places. Therefore, a double track standard gauge line was constructed, linking the main line from Calais with the Abancourt-St. Omer line. The engineer, Raoul Dautry, claimed he could build the line in 100 days. Work began on 15 May 1918 and the line opened to traffic on 15 August 1918, just 106 days later. Thus, the line was known as \"La Ligne de Cent Jours\" or The Line of One Hundred Days. The line was last used on 1 January 1919 and the track lifted in March and April of that year, thus ending the short life of the line.\n\nOn 21 May 1940, German troops invaded the Baie de Somme area. Noyelles was the scene of Allied air strikes on various occasions. In September and October 1942, coastal defences were constructed in the Baie de Somme area. In February 1944, the Germans flooded the low-lying land near Noyelles by blocking the River Dien where the railway to Saint-Valery crossed it by a long embankment (this embankment had replaced a trestle in 1912). In April and May 1944, preparations were made to prevent the Allies from using the area to invade France.\n\nOn 24 October 1941, a train was attacked at Noyelles and the locomotive was destroyed. In November 1941, one of the metre-gauge trains was attacked between Noyelles and Saint-Valery, with several railway workers wounded. Cayeux saw much increased traffic in galets, temporary -gauge lines being laid on the beach and down the streets of the village. A metre-gauge line was laid along the road from Lanchères to Ault, on the standard gauge line from Woincourt to , with a branch (or separate gauge) line at Hautebut to a quarry near the coast. The Germans brought in a number of locomotives to work these lines, and after the war, nine of them were dumped just outside Saint-Valery, where three still remain (a fourth having been removed for restoration in 1997 - see below).\n\nOn 2 December 1942 the water tower at Saint-Valery was destroyed. On 4 May 1944, the depot at Saint-Valery along with two rail cars and a locomotive, were destroyed by fire. In June, the Saint-Valery area was bombed as a diversion from the D-Day landings. On 19 August, the Resistance blew up the water tower at Noyelles, followed by an ammunition train on 1 September. English and Polish troops relieved Saint-Valery on 2 September, and proceeded to bombard the Germans across the bay at Le Crotoy.\n\nThe main types of freight carried by the railway were:\n\nA chicory processing works was built at Saint-Valery Canal. A siding was laid in 1929 to serve it. The derelict building was demolished in 1998.\n\nThe main sugar beet season was from October to January, thus providing useful income out of the tourist season. A raperie (shredding plant) was built at Lanchères. It had its own railway system and locomotives, which also worked on the CFBS line to Noyelles.\n\nBefore the railway came, the port of Saint-Valery handled \"galets\" (flint or silica pebbles) brought on rafts from Cayeux. The galets were used in the building and ceramics industries.\n\nLocal shellfish taken from the Baie de Somme were sent to market at Abbeville. Shellfish not available locally were also brought in to Le Crotoy for use in a restaurant there.\n\nSaint-Valery handled timber, jute, textiles, soap, phosphates and coal. Phosphates were mined at Crécy-en-Ponthieu and transported via a metre gauge line from there to Noyelles, and thence to Saint-Valery. Freight between Noyelles and Saint-Valery was sometimes carried in standard gauge wagons, but hauled by the metre gauge locomotives. This practice continued until 1973.\n\nAfter the Second World War, a plan was put forward to extend the standard gauge to Le Crotoy and Cayeux, with a new line to at a cost of some FRF150-200 million. In 1963 another proposal was made to extend the dual gauge track to Lanchères at a cost of some FRF93 million. Even as late as 1968 plans were being proposed to extend the standard gauge to Cayeux, this time with the closure of the branch to Le Crotoy.\n\nThe line from Saint-Valery Ville to Cayeux was relaid with rails recovered from the standard gauge Woincourt-Orival line, which closed to passengers in May 1939 and completely from 1 January 1947. In 1949 the CFBS acquired some second hand steam locomotives after the closure of the Réseau Albert. Three second-hand railcars were acquired in 1955 and a new railcar was acquired in 1957, along with two second hand diesel locomotives. A third diesel locomotive was acquired in 1960. In 1971 a pair of De Dion-Bouton type OC1 bogie railcars (X157 and X158) were acquired from the Réseau Breton (RB), having been previously used on the Chemin de Fer des Côtes-du-Nord (CdN). X158 was subsequently transferred to the Chemins de Fer de la Corse, and is now preserved by the CdN Society at Langueux. A trailing railcar was also acquired from the RB in 1971, having previously been built as a powered railcar.\n\nThe CFBS steam locomotives were mainly confined to the sugar beet trains after the war. The very last CFBS steam train running on 5 April 1959. The steam locomotive from the raperie at Lanchères worked until 1965. The raperie itself closed in 1966, at the end of the '65-66 season.\n\nEven as late as 1958, the CFBS lines were carrying some 50-55,000 tonnes of freight, including 35-40,000 tonnes of sugar beet and 10,000 tonnes of galets. In that year, a railcar caught fire at Cayeux, and the fire destroyed the loco shed, which was rebuilt. In 1961, the SE merged with the Compagnie Générale de Chemins de Fer et de Transports Automobiles (CFTA). The CFTA had interests in road transport, and instigated a system of rationalisation and cuts. The company livery changed from green to red and cream. Both goods and passenger traffic declined during the middle '60s and the line from Noyelles to Le Crotoy closed with effect from 31 December 1969. CFTA worked the line to Cayeux for three more years, galets being carried by rail as late as 1970. The line from Saint-Valery to Cayeux closed with effect from 31 December 1972. The SNCF continued to use the standard gauge line between Noyelles and Saint-Valery for occasional freight trains. The SNCF line between Noyelles and Saint-Valery was last used on 6 February 1989 and closed with effect from 1 January 1993.\n\nLocal opposition to the closure of the line to Le Crotoy was strong, and a preservation group was formed on 13 November 1969, initially under the name of Association Ferroviaire Picardie, and from 14 March 1970 the Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme (CFBS). The initial aim of the society was to preserve the line from Noyelles to Le Crotoy as a tourist line. The first tourist trains ran on 4 July 1971, but although the railway had permission from SNCF to run into Noyelles, they were not allowed to drop or collect passengers there under an agreement with the local bus company. This arrangement lasting until 1986.\n\nWith the announcement that the Cayeux line was to close, the CFBS set up a new company, the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer Touristiques et Industriels de Picardie (CFTIP), which was founded 17 April 1973. From 1973 to 1981 it was the CFTIP rather than the CFBS which was responsible for running the trains. The CFTIP was unsuccessful in its bid to take over the freight traffic from Noyelles to Saint-Valery from SNCF. In 1976, there was a split within the CFBS/CFTIP, a splinter group, the Chemin de Fer Touristique de la Côte d'Opale (CFTO) running trains between Saint-Valery Ville and Cayeux. The CFTO folded in December 1977 and the Cayeux line reverted to the CFTIP. By the late 1970s, the growth in the numbers of passengers meant that more coaches were needed, but those inherited from the SE/CFTA were in poor condition. Nine coaches were acquired from Switzerland between 1978 and 1984.\n\nThe CFBS again suffered a drop in passengers in the early '80s, but in 1982 the CFTIP was wound up, and the CFBS confirmed as its successor in an agreement with SNCF and the Somme Département.\nAt the end of the operation of the public service by the CFTA, an association of volunteers passionate about railways, the nonprofit Association of Railway Bay of Somme (SFBC), established on March 13, 1970 decides to operate as a tourist railway line Sea Baths group linking Noyelles-sur-Mer in Crotoy, closed since December 31, 1969 . The operation of the line is then only during the summer. Winter is conducive to maintenance of the line and equipment.\n\nThanks to the financial support of different institutions (the municipalities served, Grand Picardy coast (formerly SMACOPI), General Council, Regional Council, State - DRAC, European Union etc.) enabled the CFBS to perform maintenance of the tracks, stations and equipment. All this caused a continuous increase in the number of visitors in the mid- 1990s, which increased from 20 000 to 100 000 per year. In 2011, the association exceeded the symbolic threshold of 150,000 passengers and there were more than 162 000 passengers carried in 2013.\n\nAlthough the whole line is preserved, the section from Saint-Valery to Cayeux is operated only on certain days between April and September, including all save 4 days in July and August. Five of the minor stations or halts are still in use, in addition to the stations in the above named towns.\n\nThe SFBC is an association made up of over 400 members, including at least 80 active volunteers, and employs the equivalent of 22 full-time employees. The CFBS self-finances its operating costs (salaries, maintenance, coal, etc.) and participates in investments (facilities, infrastructure, equipment etc.)\n\nThe CFBS operates its network with meter-gauge track, but dual-gauge track remains between the station Noyelles and Saint-Valery Port. Transhipment facilities for cargo still exist in Noyelles that are used in every Steam Festival.\nThe various lines are single track, with passing loops in the station, allowing trains to cross.\nExcept Noyelles station, equipped with a mechanical signaling system of the old SNCF type, there is little signalling on the line, and traffic safety is ensured by instructions. A Line Manager ensures the operational use of the network and can communicate by \"ground-to-train\" radio with all trains. Automatic level crossings are installed at intersections with major roads and unguarded crossings to other crossings.\nThe workshop equipment is installed in Saint-Valery Canal Station. Turntables exist at Noyelles, Saint-Valery Ville and Port, Le Crotoy and at Cayeux. However, the locomotives can travel in both directions of traffic without being rotated. E.332 is the only CFBS locomotive which cannot be turned on any of the turntable except Saint-Valery Port.\n\nThere is still a track connection with the SNCF which is commonly used during the Steam Festival.\n\nThe line from Noyelles sur Mer to Le Crotoy is metre gauge.\n\nThe line from Noyelles sur Mer to Saint-Valery Ville is of dual gauge, with metre gauge tracks laid within standard gauge track, thus having four rails. At Saint-Valery there is a branch to the Saint-Valery docks which is dual gauge, but having three rails only. The line from Saint-Valery Ville to Cayeux (Brighton Plage) is metre gauge.\n\nThe Festival of steam was organized for the first time in 1988 on the occasion of the centenary of the Network de Bains de Mer. The CFBS organized a steam engine rally in Noyelles-sur-Mer, the point of correspondence between the Network Bains de Mer and that of the SNCF . It quickly became a major event, and the CFBS reorganizes it every three years, with many steam engines from all over the Europe. It has become a major event for lovers of railways but also for the people of the Somme bay and tourists. The railway is of course put forward, but also the tractors, buses, rolls, saws ... and many other machines from the past are exhibited.\nThe last event took place on 27 and 28 April 2013 . The association has set up a website dedicated to the event, which recounts the various steam events (until 2009 ). For the 2013 event, many materials have come from other networks including seven steam locomotives (including 150 p. 13 of the Train City and 020 Peckett n o 12 \"Marcia\" of the Kent & East Sussex Railway ), several carriages and a Sprague-Thomson of Paris metro owned by ADEMAS . This event welcomed nearly 21,000 visitors including 7,250 travelers.\n\nFrom Le Crotoy to Cayeux the stations are:\n\nThis station is on the metre gauge branch from Noyelles, opened on 1 July 1887. There is a shed where the steam engines can be stored and light maintenance can be carried out.\n\nA small halt serving the village of Favières.\n\nA small halt serving the village.\n\nA station was opened at Noyelles in 1847, being on the standard gauge line between Boulogne and Amiens. In 1858 a single track branch opened to Saint-Valery sur Somme. Metre gauge branches opened to Le Crotoy and Cayeux in 1887, the latter being laid between the rails of the standard gauge branch to Saint-Valery. The final line to be built to Noyelles was a metre gauge branch to Forest l'Abbaye which opened on 24 August 1892 and closed to passengers on 10 March 1947 and freight on 1 February 1951.\n\nThis was the site of the original terminus of the standard gauge branch from Noyelles, opened on 5 June 1858. It is now the site of their depot, although some of the original buildings still survive.\n\nThis was the main station for Saint-Valery when the dual gauge line was opened in 1887, the station at Saint-Valery Ville then being a halt.\n\nThis station opened on 6 September 1887. The station has always been dual gauge.\n\nA small halt serving the villages of Pendé and Routhiauville.\n\nThis station is on the metre gauge branch from Noyelles to Cayeux, it opened on 6 September 1887 and serves the villages of Lanchères and Pendé.\n\nThis halt was opened in 1890 after local people called for a station to be built.\n\nThis station is the terminus of the metre gauge branch from Noyelles. It opened on 6 September 1887. In 1912, a extension was built to serve a or gauge railway worked by horses to bring galets (flints) for onward shipment. Another short extension was also built at Cayeux after WWII to serve the Sansom factory; this was in use until the 1960s.\n\nThe \"Association du Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme\" has restored a number of locomotives, railbuses, carriages and wagons to full use, others await overhaul or restoration. All vehicles are metre gauge unless otherwise denoted.\n\nNone of the original steam locomotives that worked on the Réseau des Bains de Mer have survived into preservation. The locomotive that most represents those that did work the line is the Haine-St.-Pierre loco, which carries works number 1316/1921. A group of eleven similar locos, works numbers 1304-14 inclusive were built in 1921 for the SE, and four of those are known to have worked on the Réseau des Bains de Mer system, including the CFBS lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CFBS is twinned with the Kent and East Sussex Railway, a preserved standard gauge railway in England. The twinning agreement was signed on 27 April 1996 at Noyelles. The K&ESR's P Class locomotive was present. The railway is also twinned with the Association des chemins de fer des Côtes-du-Nord on the northwest coast.\n\n", "id": "7741409", "categories": ["Railway lines closed in 1993", "Heritage railways in France", "Somme (department)", "Metre gauge railways in France", "Standard gauge railways in France", "Tourist attractions in Somme (department)", "Railway companies of France", "Transport in Hauts-de-France", "Railway lines closed in 1969", "Railway lines opened in 1858", "Railway lines opened in 1971", "Railway lines opened in 1887"], "title": "Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741453", "text": "KSYN\n\nKSYN (92.5 FM), known as \"Kissin' 92.5\", is a CHR radio station licensed to Joplin, Missouri. It serves the \"Four-State Region.\" Cities in KSYN's primary coverage area include: Joplin, Neosho, Monett, and Nevada, Missouri; Pittsburg, Parsons, Fort Scott, and Chanute, Kansas; Miami and Vinta, Oklahoma; and Bella Vista, Rogers, and Bentonville, Arkansas.\n\nKSYN was founded in 1960 by William B. \"Bill\" Neal. Following an injury that occurred during the Battle of the Bulge, Neal was transferred to Paris, France where he began his career in broadcasting with the Armed Forces Radio Service. In addition to KSYN, Neal owned WMBH and founded Joplin AM station KQYX. In 2000, Neal was awarded the Pioneer in Broadcasting Award from Missouri Southern State University in recognition of his work in the development of FM radio and for his role in popularizing the modern AM talk radio format. He is also one of only six individuals to be honored with the Lifetime Member award from the Missouri Broadcasters Association.\n\nThe 1960s & 1970sOn December 19, 1960, KSYN became the first FM radio station to operate in the Four State Region. It was the tenth FM station established in Missouri and the state's most powerful, with a 100,000 watt tower that stood more than 90 stories tall. In these early days, KSYN could be heard clearly as far away as Kansas City, Missouri and Tulsa, Oklahoma. It began carrying the \"American Top 40\" program with Casey Kasem during the early 1970s.\n\nWhile the increasing popularity of Rock 'n' Roll helped propel KSYN's rapid ascent to number one in listener ratings, Neal still had to overcome a fundamental problem: few people in those days owned FM receivers. To meet this challenge, KSYN provided free radios to area businesses and organizations so that they could hear for themselves the differences in sound quality between AM and FM. A small black and silver sign was provided with each radio for display reading, \"The Wonderful Sound of F.M. - KSYN\". To reach mobile listeners, the station gave away hundreds of FM car radios at live remotes and on the air to callers who answered trivia questions correctly. To those unable to obtain free FM radios, the station offered receivers for sale at wholesale prices.\n\nDuring this period, KSYN was known for large-scale, innovative promotions. In a 2000 interview with Missouri Southern State University, Bill Neal remarked that, \"Radio is about promotion.\" Translating this philosophy into action, the station regularly underwrote the costs of bringing popular artists to Joplin. It also developed an annual \"KSYN Olympics,\" which was held at Wildcat Park and Shadow Lake. Events included bikini contests, boat races, and numerous other competitions designed to entertain the large and often raucous crowds. One particularly memorable promotion involved a helicopter that showered $40,000 in cash and prizes over downtown Joplin. This promotion effectively closed downtown for a day, leading the city to inform the station owner that any future permit applications would not be viewed favorably.\n\nIn the late 1960s and throughout most of the 1970s, broadcasting hall of fame announcer Bob James hosted a popular news talk show on Sunday mornings that featured local and state public officials, high school and college coaches, and other newsmakers. James is perhaps best known for his coverage of the Connor Hotel collapse, which occurred November 11, 1978. During the days following the incident, KSYN provided in-depth coverage of the events from its mobile news unit, which was parked downtown near what remained of the hotel. James' reporting focused on the search and rescue efforts for three men who were trapped beneath the rubble. When, after 77 hours, rescue workers found one of the men alive in a corner of the hotel's basement, James was there to report the news that so many had been waiting to hear. With Bob James as News Director, KSYN was an important source for both news and entertainment.\n\nThe 1980sKSYN may have reached its apex in terms of popularity and influence in the early and middle 1980s. In 1985, for example, KSYN had 17.5 percent of the total listenership, winning the top spot for every segment of the day. Radio was still largely free of competition from other music delivery platforms; MTV was just catching on and the internet, MP3 players, and satellite radio had yet to be created. \n\nRather than sitting back and allowing the popularity of the format to carry the station, Bill Neal sought to cement KSYN as an indelible part of local popular culture. He accomplished this by further accelerating promotional activities. During these years, KSYN tee shirts and bumper stickers were ubiquitous throughout the Four State Area. The station regularly gave away thousands of dollars in cash, not to mention countless tee shirts, hats, cases of soft drinks, and Worlds of Fun tickets. And KSYN didn't just broadcast the music; it brought the artists who made the music to Joplin, sponsoring top shelf acts such as Joan Jett and The Blackhearts, Jefferson Starship, Air Supply, Stevie Ray Vaughan, John Waite, Survivor, Night Ranger, and Cheap Trick. In addition, KSYN's current moniker draws its heritage from this period when, in the early 1980s, it was known as \"Kissin 92.5, Your Number One Hit Music Leader.\"\n\nThe 1990sLed by Tulsa, Oklahoma's Garth Brooks, the early 1990s saw a powerful resurgence in country music. Seemingly overnight, country overtook rock as the most popular radio format. Put simply, country was in and rock was out. This phenomenon knocked KSYN from atop the listener ratings for consecutive years for the first time in its history. And while country music's popularity has receded from this high-water mark, it remains to this day the most popular format in the Four State Region.\n\nAlthough the early 1990s and country music brought an end to KSYN's 40-year reign at the pinnacle of listener ratings, this period is not without its high points. Chief among these is that the broadcasting station was refurbished. Compact disk players replaced tapes and records, improving sound quality. Computers took the place of several refigerator-sized mechanical processors, enhancing programming reliability. And remote satellite programs replaced overnight announcers, saving costs while adding an element of national entertainment to the lineup. In short, the station took a giant leap toward the 21st Century.\n\nBy 1995 rock had begun to recover and so had KSYN's listener ratings. Given the overall favorable dynamics, it was in this year that William B. Neal chose to conclude his career in broadcasting—a career that spanned more than a half century—by selling KSYN to Big Mack Broadcasting, Inc. Big Mack was owned by Chuck Dunaway who was, like his predecessor, an influential figure within the radio business, having been inducted into both the Texas and Ohio Broadcasting Halls of Fame.\n\nChuck Dunaway's career in radio began in 1952 as an announcer for KBST in Big Spring, Texas. Quickly rising through the ranks, in the late 1950s he assumed the afternoon drivetime slot for New York's top rated station, WABC-AM. Dunaway eventually parlayed his success as an announcer into station proprietorship, purchasing his first radio station in 1982 and eventually owning six in the Joplin market alone. Under Dunaway's relatively brief period of ownership, KSYN continued much as it had under Neal. Chuck Dunaway's legacy at KSYN could be described as that of a steady and experienced hand who bridged the gap between long-term owners.\n\nThe Modern Era\nIf one were looking to quickly categorize KSYN's history, it could be logically divided into two parts: the William B. Neal era, which spans from 1960 to 1995; and the James L. Zimmer era, which began in 1998 and continues into the present.\n\nSince 1998, KSYN has been owned by James L. \"Jim\" Zimmer under the Zimmer family's Zimmer Radio Group (1998–2006) and Zimmer Radio, Inc (2007–present). During the Zimmer era, the station has been brought fully into the modern, computer age and KSYN's position near the top of listener surveys has been re-established.\n\nUnder Zimmer, KSYN became only the second station in the Four-State Region to begin broadcasting in HD Radio and was one of the first to embrace the internet platform for content distribution. The station's HD2 channel, \"Kissin' HD2\", offers improved sound quality and a slightly different format than the primary \"Kissin 92.5\" in the form of more urban oriented music.\n", "id": "7741453", "categories": [], "title": "KSYN"}

At the outbreak of the Anglo-Satsuma War of 1864, he was appointed captain of the \"Tenu Maru\". Along with Matsuki Koan, he was taken prisoner by the Royal Navy when his ship was captured. He was chosen as one of 15 students to be sent to Great Britain to study at the University College, London in defiance of the Tokugawa bakufu's official national seclusion policy.\n\nIn 1865 Godai made contact with Thomas Glover who steered negotiations with the Platt textile machinery giant in Oldham, Lancashire, England. This visit led to the establishment of the Kagoshima Mill in Satsuma in 1867 - reputed to be Japan's first modern factory. Manchester engineers spent a year in Kagoshima to supervise building, factory production and the training of local workers. The \"Manchester Seven\" - as they became known had a special \"White Mansion\" constructed for their comfort and is today a museum. Godai's UK visit also included the Manchester Chamber of Commerce - reputed to have inspired the foundation of the pioneering Osaka Chamber and Industry.\n\nGodai later returned to Europe to negotiate with the Comte des Cantons de Charles Montblanc (1832–1893) to establish a joint venture commercial enterprise for the development of Satsuma's natural resources in exchange for European weapons and manufactured goods. This French–Satsuma trading company attracted French investment into the Satsuma domain to establish a steamship shipyard and textile (silk) spinning factories and to send promising students from Satsuma overseas. Its existence also allowed Satsuma to participate as if it were an independent country in the Paris Exhibition of 1867, much to the consternation of the Tokugawa-government representatives. At the same time, Godai used his contacts to purchase the latest warships to equip the Satsuma in preparation with the growing conflict to overthrow the Tokugawa regime.\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Godai became a \"San'yo\" (junior councilor), and used his foreign experience to defuse a number of incidents created against foreigners by xenophobic ex-\"samurai\". He resigned from government service in 1869, and turned his full attention to business. Basing himself in Osaka, he created several major joint stock companies involved in international trade, commerce and shipping, which he operated simultaneously. Godai went on to found the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and the Osaka Stock Exchange. He also participated in the Osaka Conference of 1875, which attempted to hold together the fragile coalition of feudal domains which dominated the early Meiji government.\n\nGodai was later implicated in the Hokkaido Colonization Office Scandal of 1881, which brought down the administration of Prime Minister Kuroda Kiyotaka.\n\n", "id": "7741458", "categories": ["1836 births", "People of Meiji-period Japan", "People from Satsuma Domain", "Shimazu retainers", "Japanese expatriates in the United Kingdom", "1885 deaths", "Meiji Restoration"], "title": "Godai Tomoatsu"}

It stars Danny Kaye and was directed by Henry Koster. The film also stars Walter Slezak, Gene Lockhart, Barbara Bates, Elsa Lanchester, Alan Hale Sr. and Rhys Williams. Original music by Sylvia Fine and Johnny Green.\n\nThe film is loosely based on Nikolai Gogol's play \"The Inspector General\". The plot is re-located from the Russian Empire into an unspecified corrupted region of a country that suddenly finds itself under the supervision of the First French Empire.\n\nGeorgi (Danny Kaye), an illiterate member of a wandering band of Gypsies led by Yakov (Walter Slezak) escapes from a travelling medicine show after he innocently lets slip that the elixir they're selling is a fraud. Tired and hungry, he wanders into the small town of Brodny and whilst trying to sample the contents of a horse's feedbag, he's arrested as a vagrant and sentenced to hang the next day by a corrupt police chief (Alan Hale Sr.), desperate to prove his efficiency.\n\nThe town is run by a corrupt Mayor (Gene Lockhart), whose employees and councillors are all his cousins and equally corrupt and incompetent, but they are frightened when they learn that the Inspector General is in their neighborhood, and probably in disguise. The band of officials and the mayor want to protect their town and their lives, so, acting foolishly they seal off every road to keep the inspector from entering their town. They mistake Georgi for the Inspector and ply him with food and drink whilst plotting to have him killed. Yakov wanders into the small town and convinces Georgi to stay on as an inspector general and accept the bribes the officials so willingly throw at him. Of course, Yakov wants to seize Georgi's misfortune and turn it into a new start for his own life.\n\nMeanwhile, hearing tales of his legacy and courageous efforts the mayor's wife instantly takes a liking to Georgi, hoping he will fall in love with her and whisk her away from the mayor and his lack of attention to her. However Georgi has fallen in love with a servant and wishes to marry her.\n\nNaturally, their plans go awry and Georgi, despite his innocence, discovers how corrupt they really are. And when the real Inspector arrives suddenly, he also realizes that Georgi is the most honest fellow he's met since leaving Budapest. The Inspector General names Georgi the new Mayor of Brodny and presents him the mayoral gold chain, having taken it from the old mayor saying, \"We'll put something else around your neck.\" Yakov becomes the new chief of police and Georgi gets the girl of his dreams.\n\n\nJohnny Green won a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Score for his work on the film. Kaye's wife Sylvia Fine wrote the original songs \"The Inspector General\" and \"Happy Times,\" both sung by Kaye in the film. \"Happy Times\" was, in fact, the working title of the film.\nAccording to Warner Bros records the film earned $2,154,000 domestically and $1,756,000 foreign.\n\"The Inspector General\" is one of a number of major Hollywood productions from the 1940s and 1950s that have lapsed into the public domain in the United States.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741551", "text": "Fort Terry\n\nFort Terry was a coastal fortification on Plum Island, a small island just off Orient Point, New York, USA. This strategic position afforded it a commanding view over the Atlantic entrance to the commercially vital Long Island Sound. It was established in 1897 and used intermittently through the end of World War II. In 1952, it became a military animal and biological warfare (BW) research facility, moving to civilian control in 1954 as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. However, the biological warfare mission continued under civilian control until 1969, when the US ended offensive BW research. The island is now being considered for sale or conversion to a wildlife refuge.\n\nFirst “owned” by the Corchaug and Montaukett Indian tribes the Plum Island was sold to Samuel Wyllys for a coat, a barrel of biscuits and 100 fishhooks. The original fort was constructed after the federal government acquired Plum Island from Abraham S. Hewitt, a former mayor of New London, Connecticut, for $25,000. It is not clear how Hewitt became owner of the property.\n\nFort Terry, named for Major General Alfred Terry, began construction in 1897 under the Endicott Program as part of the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound, and was expanded several times from the time of the Spanish–American War through World War II. The initial federal purchase was for 150 acres; however, the rest of the island was turned over to the federal government in 1901.\n\nIn 1898, before any of Fort Terry's batteries were completed, the Spanish–American War broke out. It was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast. A number of weapons were purchased from the UK and hastily mounted to give the nascent fort system some modern armament. By March 1898 a 4.7 inch/45 caliber gun was mounted at Battery Kelly under this program. It was later transferred to the Sandy Hook Proving Ground in New Jersey, possibly in 1903. A pair of emplacements for modern 8-inch M1888 guns on modified 1870s-era Rodman carriages were also built at nearby Fort Tyler, but these seem to have not been armed.\n\nBetween 1897 and 1906 the following batteries were constructed at Fort Terry:\n\nBattery Stoneman was named in honor of Brevet (Bvt.) Major General (MG) George Stoneman, who served with distinction during the U.S. Civil War, died 5 Sep 1894. Battery Steele was named in honor of Bvt. MG Frederick Steele, U.S. Army, who served with distinction during the Mexican–American War and the U.S. Civil War, and who died on 12 Jan 1868. Battery Bradford was named on March 13, 1902 in honor of Captain James Bradford, U.S. Artillery, who was killed on November 4, 1791, in action with hostile Indians at Fort Recovery, Ohio. Battery Floyd was named in honor of 2nd Lt. Robert Floyd, 3rd US Artillery, mortally wounded in the Battle of Chickamauga, GA, died on 23 Sep 1863. Battery Dimick was named in honor of Justin E. Dimick, an artillery officer mortally wounded in the Battle of Chancellorsville, VA, died on 5 May 1863. Battery Eldridge was named in honor of Capt. Bogardus Eldridge, U.S. Infantry, who was killed in action at Bocoor, Philippine Islands, 2 Oct 1899. Battery Dalliba was named in honor of Bvt. Major James Dalliba, assistant commissary of ordnance, who served 1811-1824 and died 8 Nov 1832. Battery Greble was named in honor of 1st Lt. John Greble, 2nd US Artillery, killed in action at the Battle of Big Bethel, 10 Jun 1861.\n\nBattery Steele was unusual in that the two 10-inch gun emplacements are on different levels on a hillside.\n\nAs an artillery post, Fort Terry was heavily armed as part of the Coast Defenses of Long Island Sound. The Army's forts of this type were garrisoned by the Coast Artillery Corps. By 1914 the fort had 11 gun batteries and facilities to control an underwater minefield. In addition the post was home to an advanced fire control system for both the guns and the minefield. The grounds also had a functional 36\" gauge railroad built in 1914. The Porter locomotive was used to haul munitions from bunkers to the artillery batteries.\n\nFort Terry served as an artillery post during the Spanish–American War, and it was intended to attack enemy ships as they headed toward New York City. Organized in 1907, it was initially manned by the 133rd Company, Coast Artillery Corps, organized in 1907. In 1916, they were re-designated as the 3d Company, and continued to serve in that capacity throughout World War I. Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Hero, Jr was in command of the post in August, 1915.\n\nFollowing the American entry into World War I in April 1917, changes were made at the stateside forts with a view to putting some coast artillery weapons into the fight on the Western Front. The Coast Artillery Corps manned almost all US heavy and railway artillery in that war, with stateside forts reduced to a minimum garrison to provide gun crews in France. The forts were also important as mobilization and training centers. The four 6-inch guns of Batteries Floyd and Dimick were dismounted in 1917, to be mounted on field carriages for service in France. The pair of 5-inch guns of Battery Kelly were apparently remounted at Fort H. G. Wright until scrapped in 1919. The 6-inch guns appear to have arrived in France, but for lack of training time none of the 5-inch or 6-inch batteries saw action in that war. The guns were never returned to Fort Terry. In 1918 four of Battery Stoneman's mortars were removed; this was to improve reloading time as reloading four mortars simultaneously in one pit was cumbersome. Many of the mortars removed under this program became railway artillery, but none of these were shipped to France during the war.\n\nFollowing the end of World War I, Fort Terry was declared surplus and put under the control of personnel at Fort H.G. Wright in caretaker status. Two anti-aircraft batteries with two guns each were built in 1920, probably armed with the 3-inch gun M1917. In 1924, Fort Terry was used by the Portsmouth (NH) National Guard Armory (the 197th Coast Artillery Regiment (Antiaircraft)) as their summer encampment and training location. The gun and machine gun battalions worked on night firing solutions at aerial balloon targets, tracked by the searchlight battalion. In 1930 the federal census for New York identified 133 people living on Fort Terry. In 1930 the Justice Department conducted a study on building a 1000-cell prison on the island, but it was deemed impractical and was not built. In 1932-34, the 3-inch gun batteries Hagner, Greble, and Campbell were disarmed.\n\nDuring World War II, the post was put to use as a training facility and supply depot. and as a look-out for German U-boats and planes. On 7 December 1941, the fort was listed as manned by the 242nd Coast Artillery Regiment (Harbor Defense) of the Connecticut Army National Guard. Today, on the east side of Plum Island, a network of trenches remains from the area's tenure as an artillery post. Fort Terry's guns were superseded by the pair of 16-inch batteries at Camp Hero in Montauk by 1944, so all except the four 3-inch guns of Batteries Eldridge and Dalliba were scrapped.\n\nDuring World War II the following batteries were built at Fort Terry:\n\nAfter World War II it was determined that gun coast defenses were obsolete. In 1948, the fort was once again declared surplus and disarmed with all guns scrapped.\n\nBeginning April 15, 1952, it served as a U.S. Army Chemical Corps facility. As such, it was under the control of the First Army. It was small and focused primarily on anti-animal biological warfare (BW) research aimed at enemy livestock. Anti-animal agents rinderpest and foot and mouth disease were the main areas of research. When the decision to use the Fort as a research facility was planned, it was envisioned that it would be staffed by less than 20 personnel.\n\nFort Terry's Chemical Corps installation covered three acres and included many of the amenities traditionally associated with U.S. military installations. Included on the grounds were various administration buildings, laboratories, a dock, a motor pool, a commissary, a hospital, a fire station, staff housing and animal housing.\n\nWhen the Chemical Corps took control of Fort Terry, in 1952, it required the remodeling of 18 original buildings on post. The Army had been developing plans for the animal disease facility at Fort Terry since 1951. A laboratory was planned for the circa 1911 Building 257, originally known as Combined Torpedo Storehouse and Cable Tanks building. The lab was not completed by the time the Chemical Corps transferred the fort to the USDA but it and the rest of the remodeled buildings were eventually incorporated into the civilian facility.\n\nIn 1954, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) took over the island, and began to use it as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. It was then staffed by at least 9 military and 8 civilian employees.\nMost of the disease research done by the USDA focused on biological warfare until Richard Nixon ended the U.S. bio-weapons program in 1969. Most of the original buildings and batteries still stand today and in many cases have been incorporated in one way or another into the island's new role as a disease research center.\n\nAs of August 2001, the fort and all of Plum Island was listed for sale with the Government Accounting Office under FORT TERRY POW SUB-STA number C02NY0619 as accepting bids, with $12,000 \"cost up to date\" for historical clean up. It is listed as \"no further action\", that is, no cleanup is needed under the FUDS cleanup program, no DOD-related hazards present.\n\nIn June 2003, the responsibility for Plum Island facilities was transferred from the USDA to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nA 2008 DHS report recommended that the remnants of Fort Terry, its buildings and batteries, be opened to the public and preserved. The Town of Southold, New York formed a Local Waterfront Revitalization Program (LWRP) which noted that many of the island's structures, including those at Fort Terry, could qualify for listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nOn 16 May 2016, the House unanimously passed “Save, Don’t Sell Plum Island”, Bill H.R. 1887 reversing the 2008 decision to put the island up for sale, which would lead to the destruction of the island, and lead to future development.\n\nThe original anti-animal biological warfare research mission at Fort Terry was \"to establish and pursue a program of research and development of certain anti-animal biological warfare agents\". The first agent that was a candidate for development was foot and mouth disease (FMD). Besides FMD, five other top secret BW projects were commissioned on Plum Island. The other four programs researched included Rift Valley fever (RVF), rinderpest, African swine fever, and a slew of miscellaneous exotic animal diseases. Among the miscellaneous diseases were 11 other animal pathogens. Shortly before the handover of the facility to the Department of Agriculture in 1954, Fort Terry's mission was altered. The number of pathogens studied was reduced to two, rinderpest and FMD, and the mission was changed to \"defensive\" research of those two diseases.\n\n\n", "id": "7741551", "categories": ["Buildings and structures in Suffolk County, New York", "Biological warfare facilities", "Forts in New York (state)", "Plum Island (New York)", "Southold, New York", "Long Island Sound"], "title": "Fort Terry"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741574", "text": "Chumash traditional narratives\n\nChumash traditional narratives include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the Chumash people of the northern and western Transverse Ranges, Santa Barbara—Ventura coast, and northern Channel Islands, in present-day Southern California.\n\nEarly analysts expected Chumash oral literature to conform to the regional pattern of Southern California narratives. However, little evidence was available before accounts from the papers of John Peabody Harrington began to be published in the 1970s. The narratives now seem to have stronger ties with central California than with the Takic and Yuman groups to the south.\n\nDespite their close ties to the Chumash, Spanish sources did little to collect information on native oral culture. In addition, the Chumash were roughly divided into 8 separate linguistic groups. Obispeño, Purismeño, Inezeño, Barbareño, Ventureño, Island, Cuyama, and Emigdiaño varied to a degree where they were closer to separate languages than similar dialects. The Chumash weren’t a cultural or linguistic sovereignty in the traditional sense; they were a conglomeration of autonomous settlements. Most recording of Chumash narratives occurred through anthropological study, specifically Harrington’s papers.\n\nLike other Native American universes, the Chumash mythical universe is ordered, but still very uncertain. Events occur at the whim of supernatural beings capable of kindness and malevolence. Supernatural beings can be both rational and irrational at times, as humans may be. Chumash narratives vary in plot, but the “hero’s journey” and “trickster’s story” appear frequently in Chumash oral culture. The motives inspiring the protagonist, however, appear dubious by Western standards. Whereas Western fictional heroes are called to action and make decisions based off a clear set of choices, Chumash protagonists act based on an abstruse imperative or “must”.\n\nMagic and death also appear commonly as literary devices. Conflict often arises between beings with innate magical powers and those who acquired their powers through magical objects or helpers. Death, wherever it occurred in native stories, was always reversible, and was usually undone with the aid of the aforementioned magical powers or special “medicines” bearing similar supernatural powers. Another commonly used literary device was inversion, where the opposite of what’s to be expected occurs, ex. supernatural beings consume only toxic materials, or events occurring at day versus night in the human world are chronologically switched in the underworld.\n\nTime is not a strongly defined topic in Chumash folklore. Very little detail is placed on the creation of the universe and there’s little chronological order to narratives, suggesting that Chumash culture valued the idea of progress over time in a different way than the West. The universe was believed to have changed only very slightly in its history; one of the few transformative events was the Flood. The Flood was believed to have transformed the so-called “First People” into present day plants and animals. Modern humans were created by supernatural powers, and death was introduced to deal with overpopulation. The Flood separated Chumash mythology into an unspecified, indeterminate past, and the world we see today. Chumash narratives would transform further with the arrival of Europeans.\n\nAgain, similar to Western folklore, Chumash narratives often began and ended with idiomatic phrases. “When Coyote was human” or, “Momoy was a rich Widow,” analogous to “Once upon a time” in Western culture, were introductions to stories about the two most commonly seen characters in Chumash narratives. As the West had, “and they lived happily ever after…,” so the Chumash had an idiomatic expression roughly translating to “I am finished, it is the end.” Most storytelling occurred at night, and some stories were told only in Winter. The Chumash highly valued storytellers, and certain narratives were made privy only to subjects of certain social status. Chumash storytellers would integrate stories from elsewhere into their own beliefs, but despite this, Chumash narratives are significantly distinct from those of neighboring cultures.\n\nThe Chumash believed their universe was divided into at least 3 worlds and groups of beings. The Middle world is occupied by humans. The first world above belongs to supernatural beings such as the Sun, and the Giant Eagle. The first world below is inhabited by monsters which enter the human world after dark. People were believed to be able to travel between worlds, but not without difficulty.\n\nPrior to the Flood, the First People dwelled in the Middle world. These people were thought to be largely humanoid with some floral or faunal characteristics related to the plants or animals they would become after the Flood. Unlike other native groups, the Chumash excluded much of the animal kingdom from their folklore. Most of the animals mentioned are birds. Plants, reptiles, mammals, and insects are mentioned occasionally, and fish only have one representative among the First People. Bears, rattlesnakes, elk, whales, and other seemingly impressive animals don’t appear as characters in Chumash folklore.\n\nAmong the First People, Coyote appears the most in Chumash narratives as the archetype hero/trickster. Coyote can be thought of as an analogy for man; he has conflicting virtues and vices. Often portrayed as an old man, Coyote is powerful and knowledgeable, but wasn’t born into the high social stratus of the supernatural beings like the Great Eagle. Also featured prominently among the First People was Momoy. Momoy, depicted as an old woman, turned into Datura meteloides (a narcotic plant) after the Flood. She was a wealthy widow who lived in a far-away place alone or with a daughter. She herself doesn’t bear power within the universe, but she can take brief glimpses into the future, and inform individuals only the probable outcomes of their actions. One who drinks the water that Momoy uses to wash her hands will fall into a coma and receive visions pertaining to their future or destiny.\n\nAccording to legends, the middle world was supported above the world below by two giant serpents, whose movements would cause earthquakes. The world above was held in place by the Giant Eagle. The middle world was believed to be flat and circular with a number of islands floating on an ocean. The Chumash live on the largest, most central island. To the West exists the land of the dead, filled with souls waiting to be reborn. The land of the dead contains 3 areas similar to purgatory, heaven, and hell: : wit, ʔayaya, and Šimilaqša.\n\nIn Chumash folklore, the soul is a separate entity from the body, but one only experiences their soul separating from their body at least 3 days after death, or as a harbinger of death. In the case where a living person saw their own soul, it was possible to avoid death by ingesting Momoy or toloache. Immediately following death, the soul oversees the destruction of their property and revisits locations frequented in life before heading Westward to the land of the dead in a ball of light.\n\nThe soul first encounters two widows who live by merely smelling food and water and bathe themselves in a spring. The soul then travels to a ravine, where it must pass two deadly boulders and two giant ravens who attempt to peck out the eyes of the soul, replacing them with poppies. Then, the soul must pass a tall woman with a scorpion-like tail. She draws attention by clapping and will sting anyone who comes too near. Finally, the soul reaches the ocean spanned by a single bridge or pole. Beneath the consistently rising and falling bridge exists evil souls petrified from the neck down. Two monsters attempt to scare the traveling soul, who, if lacking requisite knowledge or power, will fall into the sea and be transformed into a fish or amphibian. Souls who pass this final test enjoy Šimilaqša, a land ruled by a chief in a crystal house, the Sun. Here, one will eat, sleep, and play for eternity, or until they are reincarnated.\n\nThe discussion of who enters Šimilaqša varies among Chumash groups. The Ventureño, for example, believe the spirits of children and those who drown do not enter Šimilaqša, but will be reincarnated after 12 years.\n\nThe world above was inhabited by supernatural beings such as the Sun, the Two Thunders, and the ʔelyeʔwun, or Giant Eagle. They generally exist in human form, but have supernatural powers and usually only intervene in human affairs to a minimal extent. They can be malevolent if so inclined and have more control over the universe than any other beings.\n\nThe Sun was portrayed as an extremely old widower living with two daughters in a crystal house. He and his daughters subsist off human flesh and bones. He wears nothing but a feathered headband in which he tucks the bodies of small children. He carries a torch made of bark which he uses to light the world beneath him. His daughters wear aprons made of live rattlesnakes. Every day, the Sun travels a path around the world and returns to his daughters with corpses to eat. Every day, the Sun plays peon with the Great Eagle against the Coyote of the Sky and the Morning Star. On the Winter solstice, the Moon decides who has won the game for the year. If the Sun wins, there will be a rainy year and bountiful crop yields. If the Sun loses, more people will suffer and die. Some Chumash families apparently stayed indoors all day during the Winter solstice.\n\nThe Great Eagle was seen as a hands-off leader of the first people's social order. The Great Eagle would spend most of his time in the first world meditating, lost in thought. His relatives, falcon, and two hawks play a more active leadership role. The roles of everyone else of the first people follow no distinct hierarchy and reflect societal roles and positions of the Chumash themselves.\n\nThe Coyote of the Sky appears to be one of the few supernatural powers largely trusted by the Chumash. The Coyote of the Sky was believed to support the welfare of the first people and humans below. The Inezeño view him as a father figure and pray to him specifically.\n\nThe monsters of the world below, however, were thought to be intrinsically malevolent supernatural beings that always pose a threat to humans. They were often described as grotesque, nocturnal, and misshapen.\n\n\n", "id": "7741574", "categories": ["Chumash", "Traditional narratives (Native California)", "History of Santa Barbara County, California"], "title": "Chumash traditional narratives"}

He authored he influential \"Pratum Musicum\", which contains scores for lute solos, and more importantly settings of madrigals for multiple lutes and different ensembles involving lutes and voices. He also had an important influence on the next generation of lutists through his activity as a teacher of music in his own music school.\nEmmanuel Adriaenssen was born in Antwerp between 1540 and 1555. Little is known about his early life and training. It is known that he travelled to Rome in 1574 to study music. Upon his return to Antwerp he started a lute school with his brother Gysbrecht. The brothers had in 1587 a conflict with the musicians' guild of Antwerp because they practised as musicians without becoming members of the guild. Emanuel later became a master of the guild. \n\nHe married Sybilla Crelin in 1584 with whom he had six sons and one daughter. Their sons Alexander (1587-1661), Vincent (1595–1675) and Niclaes (1598–1658) became respectively a still life painter, a battle painter and a portrait painter. Prior to the Fall of Antwerp, Emmanuel was likely a Calvinist as he only had his first son baptised in a Catholic after the Fall of Antwerp. He was registered as a Catholic in the \"purge records\" of the Antwerp civic guard after the Fall of Antwerp. His wealth and good connections with the higher circles of Anwerp society may have protected him. Emmanuel was later appointed captain of the civic guard, an activity providing a regular income. In 1595 he took part in the liberation of the neighboring town of Lier, which had been occupied by troops of the Dutch Republic.\n\nAdriaenssen became a well-off burgher who frequented the local notables including probably from the nobility, who valued his virtuosity on the lute. He gained an international reputation thanks to his publications of lute music which found their way into the libraries of illustrious people, such as Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Constantijn Huygens, King John IV of Portugal and Cardinal Mazarin. Composers Adrian Denss (1594), Robert Dowland (1610), Georg Leopold Fuhrmann (1615), Jean-Baptiste Besard (1617), Wolfgang Printz (1690) and Ernst Gottlieb Baron (1727) mention him as a leading composer for lute. As a teacher, he played an important role because of the outstanding tablatures that he published and because he was the initiator of an Antwerp lute school whose pupils included, in all likelihood, Denss and Joachim van den Hove.\n\nEmmanuel Adriaenssen died in Antwerp between 2 February 1604, the date on which he made his last will, and 27 February 1604, the date of is funeral and burial in the St. James' Church, Antwerp. His wife remarried and emigrated later to Leiden in the Dutch Republic taking her youngest son Niclaes with her.\n\nThe \"Pratum Musicum\" was first published in Antwerp in 1584 and was reprinted with alterations several times until 1600. They constitute 3 editions:\n\n\nThe Pratum Musicum contains lute solos, and more importantly settings of madrigals for multiple lutes and different ensembles involving lutes and voices giving much study material for the researcher into renaissance performance practice. The book contains around 85 tablatures for fantasias, songs and dances. Most of the vocal pieces are in Italian. The Neapolitan songs, with their parallel fifths (which not required in Italian text, so it is a question here of a style marker) have a more rustic character. One of them, Del crud’amor, has an almost Oriental character. Various dances for solo lute also tend toward the rustic. \n\nThe ensemble pieces have been recorded by the Dowland Consort of Lutes and by the Liuto Concertato.\n", "id": "7741596", "categories": ["Flemish composers", "1604 deaths", "1550s births", "Lutenists"], "title": "Emmanuel Adriaenssen"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741610", "text": "Kamakura jubango\n\nThe Kamakura \"jubango\" (ten-game match) was a historically significant go match played in Japan in 1939, 1940 and 1941. It pitted Kitani Minoru and Go Seigen, close rivals for a decade and friends at a personal level, and both ranked 7 \"dan\", against each other.\n\nGo Seigen emerged victorious by a 6-4 margin. This match marked the beginning of the period of his dominance as the top player, which continued until the First Meijin Tournament in 1962.\n\nNine months before the match started, Kitani had defeated Honinbo Shusai, the Meijin, in Shusai's retirement game. The Honinbo title was to be open to competition, and both Kitani and Go took part in that tournament. Each failed to get through to the final match, which was contested by Sekiyama Riichi and Shin Kato, with Sekiyama becoming the first Honinbo under the titleholder system in 1941. The preliminaries of this first Honinbo tournament were under way during the Kamakura match. With wartime conditions, the pace of all competitions slowed considerably. All these players also took part in the Oteai competition. The first 9 \"dan\" to emerge from the Oteai was Fujisawa Kuranosuke, some years later (at this time 6 \"dan\"). At the time, it was hard to receive promotion even to 8 \"dan\". The pool of top players was rather small; Karigane Junichi was 8 \"dan\" but had stayed outside the system that had established itself around Shusai and the Nihon Ki-in.\n\nThe result of the match was the first step in the process by which Go Seigen would establish ascendancy over his rivals (except Sekiyama, who withdrew from competition because of bad health). He was promoted to 8 \"dan\" in spring 1942. Having taken on Kitani, against whom he had an unfinished \"jubango\" stopped at 3-3 in 1933 when Kitani was promoted, Go took on both Karigane and Fujisawa (whom he played in the end in three long matches), and then the new Honinbos Hashimoto Utaro and Iwamoto Kaoru. Go Seigen played again in the Honinbo tournament, but not after 1945. In later years various challenges allowed him to face the Honinbo of the time.\n\nApart from game 2, played in Shiba Park in Tokyo, and game 5 played in Gunma Prefecture, the match was held in various locations actually in Kamakura. The first game was in the Buddhist temple Kenchō-ji. Game 3 was in Engaku-ji, as were games 4, 6 and 9. The games 7, 8 and 10 were in the Hachiman Shinto shrine in Kamakura.\n\nThe starting conditions of the match were \"tagaisen\"; since the players were of equal rank: colours alternated, with Kitani winning the \"nigiri\". There was no \"komidashi\". Largely unexpectedly, Kitani went 1-5 down over the first six games, and so was subject to beating down. The final four games, beginning 29 December 1940, were therefore played at \"sen-ai-sen\", with Kitani taking Black twice, White, then Black. Of those final games, Go Seigen could win only the second, so that with a net score of 4-6 and a win with White Kitani had salvaged some of his reputation.\n\nAll ten games are masterpieces, with both players showing great spirit.\n\nThe match was sponsored by the \"Yomiuri Shimbun\".\n\n", "id": "7741610", "categories": [], "title": "Kamakura jubango"}

The history of the inheritance of the feudal territory associated with it is the most clearly known of all territories in what is today Tokyo.\n\nThe castle was strategically placed along the Shakujii River, near Sanbō-tera Pond, to control and defend the river valley. Though there may have been another similar fortification erected nearby during the Heian period (794-1185), it is likely that the last incarnation of Shakujii castle was first built after the Kamakura period (1185-1333). A dam was built around the same time, a short distance from the castle, at a spot selected by a diviner, to block the waterway.\n\nThe castle lasted into the Muromachi period (1336-1467) and was controlled by the Toshima clan. They, supported by Kanrei (Shōgun's deputy) Ashikaga Mochiuji, were in their prime during the rebellion of Uesugi Zenshū, which lasted from 1415 to 1417.\n\nHowever, roughly 40 years later, the Toshima took part in the 1477 Kyōtoku Rebellion, supporting the uprising of Nagao Kageharu. Toshima Yasutsune led the forces of Shakujii castle and nearby Nerima castle to reinforce his brother, Toshima Yasuaki, who was attacked at Hiratsuka castle. They were defeated by the army of Ōta Dōkan, a vassal of the Uesugi clan, who put down the rebellion. The Toshima then fled to Kozukue Castle. They were defeated there as well, and Shakujii castle was destroyed a short time later.\n\nRecently, attempts have been made to restore the castle. However, there is very little remaining above ground. Based on what digging has revealed, it has been difficult to determine the exact location, size, and extent of the fortifications and the moat.\n\n\"(Note: this article derives almost entirely from a translation of the article on the Japanese wikipedia.)\"\n", "id": "7741635", "categories": ["Former castles in Japan"], "title": "Shakujii Castle"}

The fire occurred when an arsonist set a wardrobe closet on fire at the Wincrest Nursing Home building, located at 6326 N. Winthrop Avenue. The alarm sounded at 11:30 a.m. and the fire was put out at 1:30 p.m. Although the building itself sustained minor smoke, fire and water damage, 23 people died from smoke inhalation. A 21-year-old housekeeper was arrested by authorities and was charged with multiple counts of arson.\n\nThe fire was described as the worst of its kind in Chicago's history, and caused the Board of Health to enact changes.\n\nIn its design plan, the building complex consisted of 28 rooms, which could accommodate 88 residents. The original brick building was demolished in 1966 as part of a three-stage construction project and was replaced by a three story building and a garden. The complex was finally completed in 1973.\n\nThe original nursing home complex was a 1,906 sq ft (177 m²) brick building consisting of two floors. In 1959, a second building was added to the rear which includes a garden. The addition increased the size of the complex to 5,179 sq ft (481 m²). The addition was built with precast concrete floor and roof slabs connected to steel beams and columns. In 1966, the brick building was removed and was replaced by a three story building; at the same time, a third floor was added to the original building constructed in 1959. Overall, the second addition expanded the complex to 9,466 sq ft (879 m²). In 1973, a third building was added with a 10 ft (3 m) corridor connecting to the existing building complex. The third building also consisted of three floors and had a floor area of 3,613 sq ft (336 m²). The construction of the third building, consisted of precast concrete floor slabs, metal roof deck on steel bar joists. All of the buildings were covered with a 5/8 inch fire rated plasterboard.\n\nAfter the entire complex was finished in 1973, it had nursing area, lounges, and a small kitchen with no cooking appliances, closets and bathrooms on the all three floors. The complex also had a laundry room, boiler room, storage room and chapel lounge which is located in the third building of the complex.\n\nIn the design plan, the nursing home complex only had two stairways. The first stairways are located in the first building, near the lobby area and the second stairway is located in the second building. Both stairways had doors that have wire mesh windows and are operated by hydraulic door closers. The complex also had only one elevator which also located in the first building across from the lobby stairway. The exterior walls of the building consisted of brick and concrete blocks surrounded by gypsum board. The interior walls also consistent of gypsum with the outer wall finish consisting of paint, wallpaper, ceramic tile and vinyl. Overall, the entire structural system of the building complex consisted of a reinforced concrete foundation and floor slabs up to thick. All of the floor slabs are supported by fire resistant columns and beams.\n\nAll of the patient rooms, lounge areas, and chapel on all three floors are had a natural ventilation system (i.e. open windows). The restroom area, enclosed garden area, nurses offices and other rooms in the building complex were ventilated by heater, air conditioner and ceiling fans. All of the buildings electrical system were composed of system II required emergency exit signs and corridor lighting system. The system operated an automatic transfer switch which operates the emergency lights in case of power failure. The third floor of the building complex had battery powered emergency lighting.\n\nThe nursing home was equipped with a manual and automatic fire alarm system that is connected directly to the fire alarm office of the Chicago Fire Department. The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated. The manual fire alarm system consisted of two pull fire alarm boxes located on each floor and one fire alarm box located at the entrance of the building. The automatic fire alarms are activated by heat sensors which are located on the third floor, both stairways and in the storage closet. The automatic fire alarm system also consisted of smoke detectors. On the third floor, three fire extinguishers and two public address loud speakers were installed.\n\nThe Wincrest Nursing Home was inspected by three departments (health, building and fire) on a monthly basis. The last inspection occurred on January 8, 1976 (21 days before the fire). All inspections showed no code or health violations.\n\nAt the time of the fire, the building was occupied by 83 residents, three nurses, 2 aides and eleven office, kitchen and maintenance staff. 28 of the residents were in the chapel room on the third floor of the building.\n\nFire was reported in room 306 by a nurse's aide who pulled the fire alarm box. The alarm was received by the Chicago Fire Department at 11:43 A.M (CDT). Attempts to put out the fire by staff proved to no avail. The first fire engine arrived at the scene of the fire 3 minutes and 40 seconds later as nursing home staff evacuated the burning building. More fire engines arrived seconds later as smoke was seen rising from the top of the building. At 11:46 A.M., firefighters fighting the fire, discovered the third floor heavily laden with smoke and trapped elderly patients in wheelchairs. The victims were immediately removed from the burning building and were transported to nearby hospitals.\n\nThe fire was put out at 1:28 p.m. CDT. The room where the fire broke out was completely gutted and the adjacent corridor sustained only moderate smoke and heat damage. Three other rooms also suffered heat and smoke damage. No smoke damage was evident on the second or first floors and water damage was minor. However, despite the minor damage to the building, 23 fatalities were reported due to smoke inhalation.\n\nAn investigation made by the Chicago Police Department and fire department. The survivors claimed that the fire was started in a plywood wardrobe closet in Room 306 which was unoccupied at the time. Although the actual cause of the fire was unknown, the Police Bureau of Investigation arrested a housekeeper who was charged with multiple counts of arson. It is unclear, however, how the authorities determined that the fire was an act of arson, and the arsonist's motives for starting the fire were never noted.\n\nThe investigation also indicated that the smoke and heat from the fire raced down the corridor and entered rooms where doors were left open. In addition, a window was left open, reducing the amount of smoke and toxic gas entering the chapel area and the lounge room thus preventing further fatalities. Investigators also cited the difficulty of moving elderly patients in wheelchairs to the nearby stairway and the inability of elderly patients of evacuating themselves from the third floor where the fire took place.\n\nThe City of Chicago and the Board of Health made several safety improvements after the fire. These improvements include:\n\n\n\n", "id": "7741710", "categories": ["Mass murder in 1976", "Nursing homes in the United States", "Building fires in the United States", "History of Chicago", "1976 fires", "1976 in Illinois", "1976 disasters"], "title": "Wincrest Nursing Home fire"}

Carrying a main battery of 18-pounder long guns, she was the first of a class of four frigates. She spent her entire career in The Channel, part of the Inshore Squadron under Sir Edward Pellew. She was wrecked in Audierne Bay in 1797, following an engagement with the French ship-of-the-line, \"Droits de l'Homme\".\n\n\"Amazon\" was one of four 36-gun, 18-pound, \"Amazon\"-class frigates built to a design by William Rule. She and her sister ship, , were ordered on 24 May 1794. Built to the same dimensions, they were: along the gun deck with a beam of and a depth in the hold of . They were 933 tons burthen a piece.\n\nWork began in June at Rotherhithe by Wells & Co, when the keel was laid down. Launched on 4 July 1795 \"Amazon\" was taken to Deptford where she was completed from 3 - 25 September. Including fitting, her construction had cost £24,681.\n\n\"Amazon\" was built to carry a main battery of twenty-six on her upper gun deck, eight on the quarter deck and two on the forecastle. She additionally carried ten carronades, six on the quarter deck and two on the forecastle. When fully manned, she had a complement of 264.\n\nIn 1795, while under the command of Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds, she was part of the Inshore Squadron under Sir Edward Pellew watching the French port of Brest to report any attempt by the French fleet to leave port. Pellew's force comprised the 44-gun ships and , the 38-gun frigate , \"Amazon\", and a second 36-gun frigate, . Cruising off Ushant, late in the afternoon of 13 April 1796, a ship was seen to windward. Pellew, ordered \"Révolutionnaire\" to sail an intercepting course while the rest of the squadron gave chase. \"Révolutionnaire\" eventually cut off the quarry, which turned out to be the French frigate, \"Unité\", and after a brief exchange of fire, forced her to surrender. A week later, on 20 April, \"Amazon\" was again in pursuit of an enemy frigate. With \"Argo\" in Plymouth and \"Révolutionnaire\" on her way home with her prize, the three remaining British frigates were lying-to off The Lizard, when 40-gun \"Virginie\" was spotted. \"Indefatigable\", being the best sailer, was first to engage, after a chase, lasting 15 hours. When \"Amazon\" and \"Concorde\" caught up, the French ship surrendered. Then on 13 June, \"Amazon\" contributed to the capture of the 16-gun \"Betsy\" and the 14-gun \"Les Trois Couleurs\" off Brest.\n\nOn 11 December 1796, \"Amazon\" was despatched with news that seven French ships of the line had arrived in Brest. This was part of the preparation for an invasion of Ireland. The French fleet left harbour and evaded the main British blockade fleet and sailed for Bantry Bay. However, storms scattered them and most returned to France having accomplished very little.\n\nIn the Action of 13 January 1797, \"Amazon\", in company with Pellew's ship \"Indefatigable\", encountered the French ship \"Droits de l'Homme\", a 74-gun ship of the line. Normally, frigates would not engage a ship of the line as they would be severely outgunned. However, there was a heavy sea and the French ship could not open her lower deck gunports for fear of flooding. This reduced her broadside considerably. \n\nPellew was seven miles ahead of \"Amazon\" when he first attacked the \"Droits de l'Homme\". An hour and a half later \"Amazon\" came up and poured a broadside into the Frenchman's quarter. The two frigates attacked her from either side yawing to rake her while avoiding much of her return fire. At 4.20 am on 14 January land was suddenly sighted ahead and the frigates broke off the attack and headed in opposite directions. \"Amazon\", going north, and more severely damaged, was unable to wear and ran aground at Audierne Bay, Isle Bas. Three crew had been killed during the battle and six more drowned, but the rest were able to reach shore. There the French captured them. The heavy seas pounding her on the beach destroyed \"Amazon\"; the \"Droits de l'Homme\", badly damaged in the battle, was also wrecked, with heavy casualties. \n\nThe court martial on 29 September 1797, routinely held by the Navy after the loss of any vessel, honourably acquitted Captain Reynolds and his officers of negligence in the loss of the ship.\n\n\n", "id": "7741747", "categories": ["Frigates of the Royal Navy", "Maritime incidents in 1797", "Shipwrecks of the Biscay coast", "Ships built in Rotherhithe"], "title": "HMS Amazon (1795)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741756", "text": "Alfred A. Tomatis\n\nAlfred A. Tomatis (1 January 1920 – 25 December 2001) was a French otolaryngologist and inventor. He received his Doctorate in Medicine from the Paris School of Medicine. His alternative medicine theories of hearing and listening are known as the Tomatis method or Audio-Psycho-Phonology (APP).\n\nTomatis' approach began as an effort to help professional singers in his native Nice based on his idea that errant hearing is the root cause of a variety of ailments. His Listening Test and later his Electronic Ear therapy were designed to alleviate these problems.\n\nAlfred Tomatis grew up in a musical family in France. His father was an opera singer, and he spent much of his childhood traveling with him and watching his opera performances from the wings. At an early age, however, he and his parents decided he was not fit for the stage. So he went into medicine and eventually became an Ear, Nose and Throat physician.\n\nSoon after he began his practice, his father began referring him opera colleagues with vocal problems. Tomatis soon discovered traditional treatments inadequate but also that there was very little research on the voice itself. He formulated the theory that many vocal problems were really hearing problems. His theory that \"the voice does not produce what the ear does not hear\", is the hallmark of his research and his method. He discovered that the voices of opera singers had damaged their own muscles of the middle ears. With damaged hearing, they were forcing their voices to produce sounds in registers they could no longer hear.\n\nIn his attempt to retrain his patients, he developed the Electronic Ear, a device which utilizes electronic gating, bone conduction transducers and sound filters to enhance the uppermost missing frequencies. The goal is to tonify the muscles of the middle ear in order to sensitize the listener to the missing frequencies.\n\nTomatis began treating a number of other problems with the same methods, including reading problems, dyslexia, depression, severe schizophrenia, and even autism. He found evidence that many of these problems result from a failure of communication, which has to do with listening and the ear.\n\nScientific reports showed that the ear starts forming a few days after conception and that the ear is fully developed by the fourth month of pregnancy. Tomatis theorized that information coming from the fetal ear stimulates and guides the development of the brain. He believed that a number of auditory communication problems begin in pregnancy, with the fetus not properly responding to the voice of the mother. Tomatis theorized that the whole body is involved in the production of speech and language. He stated that reading, even silent reading, is an activity of the ear. He recommended reading out loud, not only for children and by children, but also by adults, for 30 minutes a day. He claimed this not only stimulates the brain but is the best way to learn.\n\nHis most controversial method attempts to lead autistic children to recognize and respond to their mother's voice. The electronic ear, he maintained, could simulate the sound of the mother's voice as heard in the uterus, and to lead the child gradually to accept and respond to her real unfiltered voice. He reported that this method often brought startling results, with children crying with joy as they recognized their mother's voice for the first time.\n\nIn many of the differing issues he addressed, Tomatis believed that many problems of learning disabilities, dyslexia, schizophrenia, and depression were caused by some trauma resulting from broken relationships and poor communication. He found that treatment of these maladies requires the cooperation of the parents and even grandparents.\n\nIn his autobiography, Tomatis recounts the many run-ins he had with the medical establishment in both France and Canada, where he later worked. Eventually he left the orthodox medical community, admitting that his practice was beyond the scope of normative allopathic comprehension. He named his new field audio-psycho-phonology.\n\nTomatis reported in his autobiography that he regretted not providing scientific colleagues with more statistical evidence for his work along with his many publications, but he claimed that the benefits of his methods are difficult to measure.\n\nDue to the lack of scientific basis and the wide range of diseases it claimed to treat, French authorities have always considered Tomatis sound therapy as an alternative medicine which should not be promoted.\n\nThe results of a scientific study published in 2008\nreflect a lack of improvement in language using the Tomatis Method for children with autism. However, in 2010 Jan Gerittsen\nconducted a detailed case analysis of Corbet's reported findings on children on the Autism Spectrum Disorder. Gerittsen showed that for this particular research an individual case study design would have been the more appropriate research design method. His individual case study analysis captured with higher fidelity the effect of Tomatis Method in each of the participants. Given individual differences of children on the Autism Spectrum a group design study could omit to address the significant improvements which Gerittsen noted occurred in 60 % of the participants in the areas of language, daily living skills, social interaction and motor skills.\n\nTim Gilmor's meta-analysis, covering four smaller studies of the Tomatis method found that \"Positive effects sizes were found for each of the five behavioral domains analyzed\". These study results, although positive, are limited by major methodological issues such as small sample sizes and limited use of random assignment.\n\nGerittsen summarized 35 reteach studies documenting effects of the Tomatis Listening Method in a variety of cognitive, developmental / behavioral and aptitude domains. These include studies on children and adults with learning and developmental disabilities including auditory processing issues as well as applications for optimizing well-being and aptitude in musicians.\n\nIn 2013, Liliana Sacarin found significant early effects, after only 30 hours of Tomatis sound stimulation, in children 7-13 of age diagnosed with AD/HD when using standardized measures of performance, observed behavior and brain electrophysiology. The results of her doctoral dissertation evidenced statistically significant improvements in cognitive, attentional and behavioral measures for the Tomatis group when compared to the controls (non-Tomatis group). The Sacarin study reported that the qEEG group analysis resulted in significant brain electrophysiology changes for the Tomatis group but not for the controls.\n\nDespite criticisms of Audio Processing Integration in general and the Tomatis Method in particular, some of those treated, notably Gérard Depardieu, Sting and Maria Callas, maintain that they experienced highly beneficial results from working with Tomatis and his method.\n\nIn some websites it is reported, that in the years 2005–2007 the Ministry of Education in Poland had implemented the Tomatis Method in hundreds of schools with financial support of a programme initiated by the European Union, recommended and scientifically accompanied by the 'Instytut Fizjologii i Patologii Słuchu, Warszawa' (Institute for the Physiology and Pathology of the Ears, Warsaw). Research done in Poland (72 schools; 1333 children) proved that the training improved key school competences (ability to learn; social competences; language competences; music competences.\n\nTomatis adapted his techniques to target diverse disorders including auditory processing problems, dyslexia, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorders, autism, and sensory processing and motor-skill difficulties. It is also claimed to have helped adults fight depression, learn foreign languages faster, develop better communication skills, and improve both creativity and on-the-job performance. About some musicians, singers and actors it is also claimed they have said they had found it helpful for fine-tuning their tonal and harmonic skills.\n\nThe \"Tomatis Method\" uses recordings by Mozart and Gregorian Chant as well as of the patient's mother's voice. Tomatis' use of Mozart is not to be confused with so-called \"Mozart Effect\" popularized by American author and music researcher Don Campbell. Although Tomatis coined the phrase, his method is not directly related to claims that listening to Mozart increases intelligence.\n\nTomatis wrote fourteen books and over two thousand articles. His \"Ear and Language\", \"The Conscious Ear\", \"The Ear and the Voice\" and \"We are all Multilingual\" have been translated into English, the latter by author David Charles Manners.\n\nTomatis' awards and honors include:\n", "id": "7741756", "categories": ["Alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities", "2001 deaths", "Autism researchers", "1920 births", "French otolaryngologists"], "title": "Alfred A.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741769", "text": "John Anstis\n\nJohn Anstis (29 August 1669 – 4 March 1744) was an English officer of arms, antiquarian and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1702 and 1722. He rose to the highest heraldic office in England and became Garter King of Arms in 1718 after years of political manoeuvring.\n\nAnstis was born at St Neot, Cornwall on 29 August 1669. He was the first son of another John Anstis and his wife Mary, the daughter of George Smith. Anstis matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 27 March 1685 and entered the Middle Temple on 31 January 1690. On 23 June 1695 he married Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Richard Cudlipp of Tavistock, Devon. They had eight sons and six daughters. Anstis was called to the bar on 19 May 1699.\n\nIn March 1701, Anstis received permission from the Earl Marshal, Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk, to collect materials from the College of Arms library to assist in the defence of the jurisdiction of the Earl Marshal, which was under attack. Anstis was also elected to Parliament for St Germans in 1702. When the Garter King of Arms, Sir Thomas St George, died in March 1703 Anstis was in a position to advise Lady Howard on how to protect her son's rights from the threat of a royal nomination of a new Garter on the one hand and the assumption of the nomination by the deputy earl marshal. Sir Henry St George was nominated to be Garter and succeeded his brother in June 1703.\n\nAnstis did not stand for election to Parliament in 1705. In May 1707 Anstis was nominated Carlisle Herald of Arms Extraordinary and Norfolk Herald. This was part of a plan to persuade Garter St George to administer the office jointly with Anstis doing most of the work. In spite of the nomination, Anstis was never appointed to either post. Anstis's main rival to succeed St George was now John Vanbrugh, who had become Clarenceux King of Arms in March 1704 to strengthen his own claims to the office. In December 1710 Anstis used a change in administration to try again at securing the Gartership. On 20 January 1711 he was re-elected to Parliament in a by-election as MP for St Mawes and was then elected as MP for Launceston at the 1713 general election. He changed his strategy with St George. He continued to secure offices related to public records for himself and he remained loyal to the Tory ministry in Parliament. With his influential political friends Anstis was eventually able to obtain promise of an appointment to the office of Garter King of Arms, on 2 April 1714.\n\nAnstis was returned again as MP for Launceston in the 1715 general election and held the seat until the 1722.. By the time that Sir Henry St George finally died in August 1715, the political situation had shifted away from Anstis's political connections. Vanbrugh was nominated to the office and took measures to secure the passage of his grant. In addition, on 30 September 1715 Anstis was arrested on suspicion of involvement in plotting a Jacobite uprising in Cornwall. A protracted legal battle ensued as Anstis and Vanbrugh both claimed the title of Garter. Anstis eventually emerged victorious in May 1718.\n\nIn 1724 he obtained an order for publishing, as editor and assisted by Elias Ashmole, the \"Register of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, From its Cover in Black Velvet Usually Called the \"Black Book\"\", which was printed at his own expense. This was a transcript of the Latin \"Black Book of the Garter\", then the earliest surviving register of that order, written in about 1535, now in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. In the preface to his work he wrote:\n\"While we, with sensible regret, complain of the loss of these old annals whereby we are deprived of a great treasure, it hath been judged expedient to preserve the remains which have happily escaped this shipwreck. And therefore the eldest register remaining in the archives is now exhibited to publick view, less by the currency of time or any unforeseen accident it might be subject to the same unhappy fate. The original manuscript is a very large pompous volume in folio written in an handsome strong character on vellom, having the initial letters of each paragraph, together with the names of the companions and of the knights nominated in scrutinies, beautifully embellished with gold, placed on squares of gold and azure alternately...It hath been shewn in the introduction when and by whom this register was compiled and from what materials it was collected\".\n\nIn the following year he interested Robert Walpole in a plan for a new order of chivalry based on a revival of the medieval Order of the Bath. This led to his \"Observations Introductory to an Historical Essay on the Knighthood of the Bath\" is 1725 and to Anstis's drawing up the statutes for the new order.\n\nAnstis duly presided over the coronation of George II in 1727. In 1728 he embarked on extensive research to prove that his family was related to Archbishop Henry Chichele, the founder of All Souls College, Oxford. This research would have entitled his son, John Anstis, to a fellowship at the college. This was blocked by Archbishop William Wake, although Anstis did have his son made Blanc Coursier Herald in 1727. In 1737 he secured the succession of his office of Garter to John.\n\nAnstis died on 4 March 1744 at Mortlake, Surrey. He was buried at Duloe in Cornwall on 23 March according to his wishes.

He started his career playing football for the local village team Independiente in 1993, when he was between 17 and 18 years old. Scotti won the regional tournament title in his second season with Independiente in 1994. After three seasons in Independiente, in 1997 he joined to Central Español on trial. He spent only three months there before leaving for Montevideo Wanderers. In that club, Scotti played 12 games and scored one goal for the club during the Uruguayan first division tournament of that year.\n\nIn 1998, Scotti played for his first international club, the Chilean Primera División team Huachipato, in where Scotti had a good spell, for example, having much continuity, scoring goals and being elected the best player of the tournament in his position. He remained until the next season, because he was transferred to the Mexican club Necaxa. There, he achieved the third place FIFA Club World Championship 2000, after of beat 4–3 on penalties to Real Madrid.\nIn 2001, he returned to Uruguay to play again for Montevideo Wanderers.\nIn 2002, he was transferred to Nacional, winning the Torneo Apertura and the Campeonato Uruguayo, scoring a goal in the second final game.\n\nHe then moved to Russia in 2003 where he played for FC Rubin Kazan in the Russian Premier League until December 2006.\n\nIn January 2007, Scotti joined Argentine Primera División side Argentinos Juniors, on request of the team's coach Ricardo Caruso Lombardi.\n\nOn 31 December 2009, it was announced that Scotti had come to verbal agreements with Colo-Colo for an undisclosed fee. He put pen to paper on a one-year deal and joined Santiago club before new year's day alongside argentinian Matías Quiroga. After overcoming medical examinations and training he made his debut on 15 January 2010, in a friendly against Olimpia which Colo-Colo drew 3–3. His league debut came on 23 January, in a 3–2 loss against Unión San Felipe and his first goal for the club was in a 3–0 home victory over Palestino after an excellent free kick. Then, on 8 May, Scotti scored his second league goal in a 5–2 win to Cobresal, his goal being voted the week’s best according to CDF's top five weekly summary of goals.\n\nAfter the World Cup held at South Africa (which Scotti played with Uruguayan national team) he began to lose his shape, so that Diego Cagna (club’s coach) relegate him some games to the detriment of Miguel Riffo. On 7 November, Scotti played in the 2–2 Chilean derby draw with Universidad de Chile where was sent off after double yellow card following a challenge with adversary team striker Carlos Bueno.\n\nHowever Colo-Colo lost the race for the title with Universidad Católica in the penultimate matchday after a seven-point lead over San Carlos team, which finished when Scotti's side lost 2–1 with O'Higgins and Católica won simultaneously 3–2 over Cobreloa at Calama.\n\nScotti played for Uruguay in Copa América 2007 and in the FIFA World Cup 2010 where he scored a penalty in the shoot-out against Ghana.\nIn 2011, he won the Copa América, tournament where he scored a penalty in the shoot-out against Argentina in quarterfinals.\nOn 27 July 2010, he was reserved to play a friendly match against Angola in Lisboa.\n\nOn 23 June 2013, Scotti played against Tahiti in the 2013 Confederations Cup and missed a penalty at the 49th minute.

When she was a teenager, she kept a diary, which describes life in Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil which was then published in 1942. The diary was published under a pen name Helena Morley. When it was originally published it was in portuguese under the title \"\". The diary was then translated in to English by Elizabeth Bishop in 1957.\n\nShe was born in Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil to an English father and a Brazilian mother. Her father worked as a diamond miner. The diary chronicles Brant's daily life, and covers her teenage years until 1895.\n\nIn 1900 Brant married Augusto Mário Calderia Brant, they had five children together. Brant says that she published her diaries in order to act as a role model for younger females who may read the book. She wrote that the diary was a way to show young women what becoming an adult means, and in this way she is acting like a grandmother to the reader. One of her daughters, Ignez Caldeira Brant, married with Abgar Renault, Ministry of Education (Brazil) (1955-1956) e do Tribunal de Contas da União (1967-1973).\n\nBrant's only published work is \"The Diary of Helena Morley,\" which she began writing when she attended the Normal School. The diary discusses her daily life in the diamond mining town of Diamantina, romantic interests, but it also deals with heavier topics like loss. The book also discusses relationships, marriage in particular, but also social affairs and Brant's dreams. The topics of the book make it so that it could be a diary of a present day teenager rather than one 60 years ago Since Brant discusses her everyday life, insights about that point in history are able to be gained by reading the diary, particularly about the effects of the abolition of slavery. There is very little documentation about life post emancipation, making the diary an important resource for historians Brant is praised for her ability to add humor to the discussion of racism, which typically is associated with seriousness. Another reason Brant's book was so popular is the nostalgic that it brings the reader, the provincial life of a small town, that the reader is able to find peace in the description of the simple life.\n\nThe book attracted attention like many other diaries of young women. The prevalence of young female diaries is explained for many of the same reasons Brant's own diary is popular. That they allow the reader to feel young again and reminisce about when they were a teenager. Some of the first attention that was drawn to Brant for her work was after Alexandre Eulálio praised Brant for her work these praises placed Brant among classic Brazilian authors. French author Georges Bernanos also made the public aware of the book. Elizabeth Bishop was originally drawn to the work in 1952, then in 1957 Bishop published her English translation of the book. Bishop says that she was drawn to Brant's work because of Brant's impressive skills of observation and ability to recreate a scene using only words. Some have compared Brant's work to Jane Austen that even though she was from a small town in Brazil, its style is like work from England.\n\n", "id": "7741802", "categories": ["1880 births", "1970 deaths", "People from Minas Gerais", "Brazilian people of English descent", "Brazilian women writers"], "title": "Alice Dayrell Caldeira Brant"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741818", "text": "George Anyona\n\nGeorge Moseti Anyona (1945–2003) was a politician from Kenya.\n\nWhen he was released from prison in 1992, many people thought he would join Jaramogi Oginga Odinga's FORD-Kenya, but he opted to go alone by forming his own political party, the Kenya Social Congress (KSC). Though he easily won a seat in Parliament as had been anticipated, his Kitutu Masaba constituents squarely rejected his bid for the presidency, opting to vote for other candidates instead. Anyona's name however remains dominant among Kenya's political personalities because he is perceived by a large section of Kenyans as a brave man, who was strong enough to challenge the Kenya African National Union (KANU) government at a time when it was almost suicidal to do so.\n\nAnyona was born in 1945 in Tombe Village, Kitutu Masaba, Kenya.\n\nHe attended Tombe Primary School and Sengera Intermediate School before proceeding to the prestigious Alliance High School. From Alliance, he proceeded to Makerere University, Uganda where he studied Political Science, English, Economics and History. Before he ventured into politics in 1974, he worked for British Airways in Nairobi.\n\nThe same year he ventured into politics, he won the then Kitutu East Parliamentary seat. Anyona's political troubles began in 1977 when he was detained without trial by then President Jomo Kenyatta. He was released a year later by President Daniel arap Moi soon after he assumed power following the death of President Kenyatta. Anyona would again land in trouble in 1982, this time with his longtime friend and veteran politician Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. The two were arrested and detained without trial for attempting to form a political party Kenya African Socialist Alliance (KASA) to challenge the ruling party KANU. Shortly after they were detained, KANU sensed the danger the two politicians had exposed and immediately sought to seal the loopholes in the constitution. The result was the passing of a constitutional amendment making Kenya a \"de facto\" one-party state the same year. \nAnyona was released from detention in 1984 and for the rest of the 1980s shied away from active politics. His political comeback came in 1990 during the clamour for multi-party democracy in Kenya. To many Kenyans, this was one battle Anyona and Jaramogi could not shy away from because they were the ones who started it in 1982. Shortly after he re-entered Kenyan politics in 1990, Anyona was again arrested at a Nairobi pub and charged with sedition. Others arrested with him included Professor Edward Oyugi, Isiah Ngotho Kariuki, and Augustus Njeru Kathangu. After a marathon trial, they were jailed for seven years on charges of scheming to overthrow the Kenyan government and being in possession of seditious and proscribed publications. According to some documents presented in the trial, it was alleged that Anyona had gone as far as preparing a shadow cabinet to take over after he overthrew the government. However, it was later revealed by an Assistant Minister in the Office of the President, John Keen, that these allegations were nothing but government fabrications, aimed at silencing Anyona. In 1992, after filing appeals against their sentences, the four were released on bail. Shortly after that they were freed when the state opted not to oppose their appeals.\n\nWith the multi-party elections coming up in December 1992, all opposition parties hoped Anyona would give them his endorsement. FORD-Kenya in particular, then under Jaramogi Oginga Odinga was seen as Anyona's perfect destination. He was elected the FORD-Kenya Nyamira District Branch Chairman in absentia. In a surprising move however, Anyona rejected FORD-Kenya's overtures, opting instead to launch his own political party Kenya Social Congress, and vying for the Presidency. In the 1992 Multi-Party General Elections, he won easily the Kitutu Masaba Constituency parliamentary seat, becoming the only member of parliament from the KSC. Though his constituents expressed eagerness to send Anyona to parliament they were not nearly as eager to vote for him as a Presidential candidate.\n\nAnyona died in 2003 in a car crash in the outskirts of Nairobi.\n\n", "id": "7741818", "categories": ["Members of the National Assembly (Kenya)", "Road incident deaths in Kenya", "Alumni of Alliance High School (Kenya)", "1945 births", "Nyamira County", "2003 deaths"], "title": "George Anyona"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741845", "text": "Solomon and Sheba\n\nSolomon and Sheba is a 1959 American epic historical romance film directed by King Vidor, shot in Technirama (color by Technicolor), and distributed by United Artists. The film dramatizes events described in The Bible—the tenth chapter of the First Kings and the ninth chapter of Second Chronicles.\n\nIt starred Yul Brynner as Solomon and Gina Lollobrigida as Sheba; and features George Sanders as Adonijah, Marisa Pavan as Abishag, and David Farrar as the Pharaoh. The screenplay by Anthony Veiller, Paul Dudley, and George Bruce, was based on a story by Crane Wilbur.\n\nThe film's theme differs substantially from Biblical sources and is highly fictionalized, most notably in representing the Queen of Sheba as an ally of ancient Egypt in opposition to King Solomon of Israel, and in her having a love affair with Solomon.\n\nUnder the rule of King David, Israel is united and prosperous, although surrounded by enemies, including Egypt and its allies. The ageing King favours Solomon to succeed him, but his elder brother Adonijah (George Sanders), a warrior, declares himself King. When David learns of this, he publicly announces Solomon to be his successor. Adonijah and Joab, his general, withdraw in rage, but Solomon later offers his brother the command of the army, knowing that Adonijah may use it against him.\n\nIsrael continues to prosper under Solomon's rule. The Queen of Sheba (Gina Lollobrigida) conspires with the Egyptian Pharaoh to undermine Solomon's rule by seducing him and introducing Sheban pagan worship into Jerusalem. Solomon is indeed bewitched by her, and the two begin living together under the pretense of forming an alliance between their two kingdoms. The king's reputation is damaged, but at the same time Sheba—who sees the king's wisdom in the Judgment of Solomon—begins to truly fall in love with him and regret her plotting. Things come to a head when Solomon recklessly allows a Sheban 'love festival' (in fact an orgy in celebration of a pagan god) to be held within Israel. In an act of divine retribution, lightning from heaven destroys the Sheban altar and damages the newly built Temple in Jerusalem, and the land is beset with a deadly famine. Solomon is publicly rebuked by the people; the High Priest and Nathan the Prophet disown him.\n\nMeanwhile, Adonijah, banished by his brother after an assassination attempt, goes and strikes a bargain with Pharaoh; given an army, he will conquer Israel for Egypt, in exchange for being placed on the throne as a kind of viceroy. The tiny army mustered by Solomon (who has been abandoned by his allied states) is quickly routed, and Adonijah presses on to Jerusalem and makes himself king. Meanwhile, Sheba, now a believer in the power of the God of Israel, prays for Solomon to be redeemed and restored to power as Nathan the Prophet overhears.\n\nPursued by the Egyptians, who were sent to finish him off, Solomon thereafter devises a plan. He lines up the remnants of his army on a hill, prompting the enemy to charge. The Israelites, who have arranged themselves to face east, then use their highly polished shields to reflect the light of the rising sun into the Egyptians' eyes. Blinded, the Egyptians are prevented from seeing the chasm in front of which the Israelites have positioned themselves, and the entire army rushes headlong over the edge and falls to its death.\n\nMeanwhile, Adonijah, met with a tepid reaction to his coup, tries to stir up Jerusalem's population by ordering the stoning of Sheba. Midway through this hideous display, Solomon makes a triumphant return to the city. Adonijah attacks his brother, refusing to be deprived again of his throne, but is himself struck down. Joab, in retaliation, attempts to attack Solomon, but is struck down by Solomon's faithful retainers Josiah and Ahab. At Solomon's prayer Sheba is miraculously healed of her wounds; as he resumes his power, she returns to her homeland, now pregnant by Solomon.\n\n\nEdward Small announced plans to make a film about King Solomon as early as 1953. The following year Julius Epstein was writing a script for Small which was going to be produced by the team of Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse (who often made movies under Small's supervision). Small then announced he was developing the project with Arthur Hornblow Jr. and in 1955 Gina Lollobrigida was signed. United Artists agreed to distribute the following year. Small provided 75% of the film's anticipated $6 million budget, with United Artists provided 25%.\n\nLollobrigida came on board as financial partner, getting a percentage of the profits. The role of Solomon had been turned down by Tyrone Power and Yul Brynner; however, Power agreed to accept the part after the script was rewritten.\n\nPower's involvement meant the film became a co-production with Power's Copa Productions, headed by Ted Richmond. In the interim, Small and Hornblow had made \"Witness for the Prosecution\" together which was a hit but they decided to end their partnership. Small went into co-production with Copa Productions, with Hornblow retaining a financial interest.\n\nThe film was shot in Madrid and Valdespartera, Zaragoza, Spain. Production began on 15 September 1958, aiming for a mid-December finish.\n\nTwo thirds of the movie had been shot and the unit was in Madrid when on 15 November Tyrone Power filmed a duel scene with George Sanders, who played his brother. (The two had also filmed a sword fight in the 1942 film \"The Black Swan\".) The duel had to be repeated several times. Power finally dropped the sword and said he couldn't continue, complaining of a pain in his left arm. He was helped to his dressing room and given brandy. It is unclear what happened next, as stories differ. In one scenario, he was taken to the hospital in Gina Lollabrigida's car and died. Another scenario is that Power died in his dressing room. In order to keep his jaw from dropping, a scarf was put around his neck to \"walk\" him out of the studio to the car. This was done in part because Mrs. Power was at the hotel and knew nothing about what happened. Ted Richmond gave orders that no press was to be called, and Mrs. Power was not to be called. He died en route to the hospital. Mrs. Power was escorted to the hospital. A memorial service was held on 16 November at US Torrejon Air Force Base.\n\nProduction of the movie was halted. Because love scenes remained to be shot, another actor would have to be cast if the existing script was to be used; battle sequences had been filmed, but most of these could still be used, with close ups of the new actor added. Other possibilities discussed including rewriting the script to use Power's footage, or use Power for the first half of the movie (as \"young Solomon\"), then recasting another actor as Solomon for the second half. The issue was complicated by the fact that three different parties had full script, star and director approval: Small, Copa Productions, and Gina Lollobrigida.\n\nOn 16 November Small offered the part of Solomon to Yul Brynner, a friend of Power, and the actor accepted. This meant Brynner had to delay playing the lead role in \"Spartacus\", to which he had committed. However United Artists had not been told of Brynner's casting and were unsure of the conditions which had been granted to him. Ted Richmond wanted to pull out of producing and for a time there was some doubt if the film would go ahead at all.\n\nAnother option was to cancel \"Solomon and Sheba\" altogether: the production was insured up to $3 million in the case of the death of one of the six lead players; Lloyd's of London covered the daily $100,000 bill while the film was halted. However, in the end it was decided to proceed with Brynner in the role of Solomon.\n\nThe film was eventually completed over ten weeks after much difficulty with an estimated cost of $6 million. It was felt that this was relatively inexpensive, considering the scale of the movie; and Spain increasingly became a basis for Hollywood movies.\n\nThe film is probably most noted for an orgy scene (albeit no nudity) featuring Sheba (Lollobrigida) (see the lobby card) which was extremely licentious for Hollywood motion pictures of that era.\n\n\"Solomon and Sheba\" received its world premiere on 27 October 1959 at the Astoria Theatre, Charing Cross Road, London, where it was presented in 70mm.\n\n\"Solomon and Sheba\" received indifferent to negative reviews and Yul Brynner's performance was criticized by no less than the film's director, King Vidor, who stated that Tyrone Power had been much more believable as a conflicted king than Brynner, who apparently played it with too much self-assurance. \"Variety\", however, praised some of the film's sequences as \"magnificent production scenes\", and described Lollobrigida as showing \"the queen to be a woman of sharp brain as well as sensual beauty.\" The magazine also stated that Brynner \"does a fine job in presenting a Solomon who credibly suggests a singer of songs, yet finally is a man of ordinary flesh and blood who cannot resist Sheba.\"\n\nThe film was a box office success, earning an estimated $5.5 million in North American rentals, with a total gross of $12.2 million.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7741845", "categories": ["1950s drama films", "Films scored by Mario Nascimbene", "United Artists films", "Films based on the Hebrew Bible", "Religious epic films", "American drama films", "1959 films", "Solomon", "Films set in the 10th century BC", "Historical romance films", "Films directed by King Vidor", "English-language films", "American films", "Films adapted into comics", "Films shot in Madrid"], "title": "Solomon and Sheba"}
