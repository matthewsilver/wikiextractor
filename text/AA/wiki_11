{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741879", "text": "Manimahesh Lake\n\nManimahesh Lake (also known as Dal Lake, Manimahesh) is a high altitude lake (elevation ) situated close to the Manimahesh Kailash Peak in the Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas, in the Bharmour subdivision of Chamba district of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The religious significance of this lake is next to that of the Lake Manasarovar in Tibet.\nThe lake is the venue of a highly revered pilgrimage trek undertaken during the month of August/September corresponding to the month of Bhadon according to Hindu calendar, on the eighth day of the New Moon period. It is known as the ‘Manimahesh Yatra’. The Government of Himachal Pradesh has declared it as a state-level pilgrimage.\n\nThere are two trekking routes to the lake. One is from Hadsar village that is mostly frequented by pilgrims and trekkers. This route is easier and have adequate arrangement for basic food and accommodation during the pilgrimage season. The other one is from village Holi, which is for the more adventurous ones. This route climbs up further and then descends to the lake, providing a beautiful view. There is no other habitation, except for a small village on this route.\n\nAccording to one popular legend, it is believed that Lord Shiva created Manimahesh after he married Goddess Parvati, who is worshipped as Mata Girija. There are many legends narrated linking Lord Shiva and his show of displeasure through acts of avalanches and blizzards that occur in the region.\n\nLegend also mentions that Shiva performed penance on the banks of Manimahesh Lake. In the same vein, it is mentioned that Gaddis (Shepherd), the tribes of this region, adopted Lord Shiva as their deity. Gaddis are the people who reside in the Gaddi Valley which is the name of the upper regions of Ravi River where the Mount Chamba Kailash lies. Further, according to the legend, the Shiva, who lived in Mount Kailash, the highest mountain of the state, gifted the Gaddis with a Chuhali topi (pointed cap), which they wear traditionally along with their other dress of chola (coat) and dora (a long black cord about 10–15 m long). The Gaddis started calling the land of this mountainous region as 'Shiv Bhumi' (\"Land of Shiva\") and themselves as devotees of Shiva. The legend further states that before Shiva married Parvati at Lake Manasarovar and became the \"universal parents of the universe\", Shiva created the Mount Kailash in Himachal Pradesh and made it his abode. He made Gaddis his devotees. The land where Gaddis lived extended from west of Bharmaur, upstream of the confluence of Budhil and Ravi rivers, up to Manimahesh. Manimahesh was also considered the abode of the three Lords of the universe namely, Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma. Manimahesh was reckoned as the heaven (Kaliasa) of Lord Shiva. The waterfall seen at the Dhancho on the way to Manimahesh Lake, and which emanates from the lake, was considered as the heaven (Vaikunta) of Vishnu. The heaven of Bramha is cited as a mound overlooking the Bharmaur city. The Gaddis also believe that Shiva resides in the Mount Kailash for six months, whereafter he moves to the netherworld handing over the reigns to Lord Vishnu. The day he departs to the netherworld is observed by the Gaddis reverentially every year, which is the Janmashtami day, the eighth day of the month of Bhadon (August), the birthday of Lord Krishna (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu). Shiva returned from the netherworld to Bharamaur at the end of February, before the night of his wedding and this day is observed as the Shivratri day; Gaddis observe this also as a festive day since Shiva and Parvati returned to Mount Kailash in the Gaddi land.\n\nEtymology of 'Manimahesh' signifies a \"jewel (Mani) on Lord Shiva's (Mahesh's) crown\". According to a local legend, the moon-rays reflected from the jewel can be seen from Manimahesh Lake on clear full moon night (which is a rare occasion). However, it has been inferred that such a phenomenon could be the result of reflection of light from the glacier that embellishes the peak in the form of a serpent around Shiva's neck.\n\nA legend in which Lord Shiva himself is tricked is narrated. According to this narration linked to Dhancho where pilgrims spend a night on their way to Manimahesh Lake, Lord Shiva, pleased with the devotion of one of his ardent devotees Bhasmasur (an asura or demon) bestowed a boon, which gave powers to Bhasmasur under which Bhasmasur touching anyone would reduce that person to ashes. Bhasmasur wanted to try this boon on Shiva himself. He, therefore, followed Shiva to touch him and get rid of him. However, Shiva managed to escape and enter into the waterfall at Dhancho and take shelter in a cave behind the rolling waters of the fall. Bhasmasur could not get through the waterfall. Then, Lord Vishnu intervened and killed Bhasamasur. Since then the fall is considered holy\n\nA rare event of the first sun’s rays falling on the Mani Mahesh peak is seen in reflection in the lake like saffron tilak. This display in the lake has enhanced the legendary belief of the Gaddis on the sanctity of Manimahesh Lake at the base of the Mount Kailash, which they visit on an annual pilgrimage. This event has also contributed to the practice of taking bath in the lake on Janmashtami day or Radhashtami day, fifteen days after the birth of Lord Krishna.\n\nThe lake, of glacial origin, is in the upper reaches of the Ghoi nala(refer Leomann maps:India Himalaya Map 4) which is tributary of Budhil river, a tributary of the Ravi River in Himachal Pradesh. However, the lake is the source of a tributary of the Budhil River, known as ‘Manimahesh Ganga’. The stream originates from the lake in the form of a fall at Dhancho. The mountain peak is a snow clad tribal glen of Brahamur in the Chamba district of manimahesh range. The highest peak is the Mani Mahesh Kailas, also called ‘Chamba Kailash' (elevation ) overlooking the lake. The lake, considered a glacial depression, is sourced by snow-melt waters from the surrounding hill slopes. Towards the end of June with ice beginning to melt, numerous small streams break up everywhere, which together with the lush green hills and the myriad of flowers give the place a truly remarkable view. The snow field at the base of the mountain is called by the local people as Shiva’s Chaugan Shiva's playground. According to a belief, Lord Shiva stayed here with his consort Parvati.\n\nManimahesh is approached from three routes. Pilgrims from Lahaul and Spiti pass through Kugti pass. Pilgrims from Kangra and Mandi take the Karwarsi pass or Jalsu pass via Tyari village, near Holi in Bharmour. The easiest and popular route is from Chamba via Bharmour. The most popular is the Bhanrlour–Hadsar-Manimahesh route which involves a track from Hadsar village to the Manimahesh Lake. The highest altitude touched in this route is and it takes two days with an overnight stay at Dhancho. Season to be undertaken is June to October and it has a gentle grade. The path leading to the lake is well maintained.\n\nHalfway up this track is of open and flat meadow land to Dhancho. Tented accommodation is available here during August–September. Night halt is preferred here. Free kitchens are opened by people to feed pilgrims. But many prefer to go and pitch their tents next to the lake to feel a divine experience. En route, there is waterfall at Gauri Nallah known as the Dhancho fall. From Dhancho, it is a steep climb. This track has seen lot of improvements over the years. In the past the first climb was first done by crossing Dhancho nalla. It was so tough that people used to crawl to get across. Since they used to crawl like a monkey in this stretch it was known as 'Bandar Ghati' (monkey valley). Now this track is much improved and the newly constructed path is used. However, some still prefer to take the old route as an adventure and go through the Bandar Ghati.\n\nIn the past, on the trek from Dhancho, the bridge over the Mani Mahesh river was crossed to reach the left bank of the valley. After , the river was again crossed, over another wooden bridge, to the right bank.\n\nFrom this point, the climb passes through many zigzag paths along flowered meadows. Birch trees are seen in the vicinity, which indicates a gain in altitude as the trek proceeds. Along this stretch of the trek route, there are a number community kitchens (eateries) at about elevation. From this location, the trail to Mani Mahesh Lake could be discerned. The waterfall, flowing from the lake, is also seen at this stage. A further trek of through the grassy ridges leads to the Manimahesh Lake.\n\nEven though the Manimahesh Lake is of small size with shallow depth, its location, directly below Manimahesh Kailas peak and several other peaks and dangling glaciers, is an \"inspiration even to the least devout pilgrim.\"\n\nTrekking in the last reach is through the glacier fields of the lake. However, on the way, the walk is through the valley of flowers and wild medicinal herbs up to the lake. The lake is situated at the centre of a snowy field touching the sacred peak. The lake is surrounded by sandy boulders, small hilly mounds and prickly dry bushes, and there is no sign of any grass. It is called Shiv Chaugan (play ground of Lord Shiva). The lake appears as if it has penetrated the rugged valley. On a clear day the reflection of the abode of Shiva, the Kailash Mountain can be seen on the lake surface. All the year round, the place remains desolate, without any inhabitants, because none dares to stay here. The air is fresh but icy cold. There are almost no fauna in the lake at its precincts – no ants, snakes or any kind of wild life. A few Bird species are sighted rarely. The silence of the place is broken only when the pilgrims visit the place in large numbers, an evening before the holy dip (locally known as \"naun\") in the lake.\n\nAccording to legend, Lord Shiva performed penance for several hundred years here. The water cascades sprang out from his matted hair and took the form of the lake. The lake as formed appears like a saucer. It has two distinct parts. The larger part has icy cold water, called the 'Shiv Karotri' (the bathing place of Lord Shiva). The smaller part of the lake, which is hidden by the bushes, has lukewarm water and is called 'Gauri Kund', the bathing place of Parvati, Shiva's consort. Thus, men and women bathe in different parts of the lake. According to rites, the dip (called locally as \"naun\") in the lake is taken four times, if permitted or otherwise only once.\n\nIn the periphery of the lake, now there is a marble image of Lord Shiva, which is worshipped by pilgrims. The image is called the Chaumukha. The lake and its surroundings present an impressive view. The still, clear and unpolluted waters of the lake reflect the snow-capped peaks that overlook the valley. There is also a small temple in the shikhara style on the periphery of the lake. A brass image of Lakshmi Devi known as Mahishasuramardini is deified in the temple.\n\nThe holy pilgrimage to the Manimahesh Lake (revered by local people as resting place of Lord Shiva) is supported by the Government of Himachal Pradesh, Manimahesh Pilgrimage Committee and several voluntary organizations. For the Gaddi tribal population of the region, pilgrimage to the lake is most holy. It is held every year during the Hindu month of Badon on Radhastami, the 15th day following the festival of Janmashtami, corresponding to the Gregorian month of August or September. The Yatra or Jatra, as it is called, is also popularly known as the 'Manimahesh Yatra'. It is heralded by a procession known locally as \"holy chhari\" (holy stick carried by the pilgrims on their shoulders) trek undertaken by pilgrims and sadhus. Pilgrims undertake the holy trek barefoot and cover a distance of from the nearest road point of Hadsar to the Manimahesh Lake. Lord Shiva is the presiding deity of the yatra. The colorful procession of the \"chhari\" is accompanied by singing and recitation of hymns in praise of Lord Shiva. The Chhari trek, considered a tough trek, follows a set ancient route with stops at the designated places. To facilitate this trek, pilgrims are provided with facilities of transport (jeeps up to road ends), food and medical facilities and so forth. It is a two-day trek to the lake from Hadsar with a night halt at Dhanchho. Tents are available for hire at Bharmour or Chamba, Himachal Pradesh. Ponies are hired by some devotees for the trek. Direct trekking from Chamba is also an option undertaken by the devout, which is a nine-day trek; the route followed is Rakh (), Bharmaur, Hadsar (), Dhancho () and Manimahesh () with a brief halt at Bhiram Ghati. The return trip follows the same route.\n\nThe holy trek starts from the Laxmi Narayan temple and the Dashnami Akhara in Chamba town, with the sacred stick ('Chhari') of Gur Charpathnath carried by the pilgrims with participation of sadhus. The trek to the lake takes about 6 days. After the procession arrives at the lake, ceremonies are held all through the night. On the following day, pilgrims take a holy dip (\"naun\") in the lake. After taking bath in the holy waters of the lake, pilgrims circumambulate the lake three times as an act of reverence, seeking blessings of the Lord Shiva. However, before taking a final dip in the Mani Mahesh Lake, women devotees take a dip at the Gauri Khund, which is situated about a mile short of the lake while men take bath at Shiv Karotri a part of the main lake. The belief is that Parvati, Shiva’s consort bathed at the Gauri Khund, while Shiva took his bath at the Shiv Karotri. State priests of Bharmaur Brahmin family perform the worship (Pujas) in all temples within the lake precincts.\n\n", "id": "7741879", "categories": ["Hindu pilgrimage sites in India", "Sacred lakes of India", "Lakes of Himachal Pradesh"], "title": "Manimahesh Lake"}

It premiered on Broadway in 1972 and was staged in the West End twenty years later.\n\nTwo unemployed musicians, bass player Jerry and saxophone player Joe, witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago. In order to escape gangster Spats Palazzo and his henchmen, they dress as women and join Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopaters, an all-female band about to leave town for an engagement at a Miami Beach hotel.\n\nComplications arise when Joe, now known as Josephine, falls in love with beautiful band singer Sugar Kane, who has a slight drinking problem that tends to interfere with her ability to choose a romantic partner wisely. More than anything, Sugar wants to marry a millionaire, prompting Joe to disguise himself as the man of her dreams.\n\nMeanwhile, wealthy and elderly Osgood Fielding, Jr. is pursuing Daphne, unaware she really is Jerry in drag. As much as he knows he needs to reveal his true gender to his over-amorous paramour, Jerry is beginning to enjoy all the expensive gifts bestowed upon him on a regular basis.\n\nTotal chaos erupts when Spats and his gang descend upon the hotel and realize who Josephine and Daphne really are.\n\nProduced by David Merrick and directed and choreographed by Gower Champion, \"Sugar\" opened on Broadway at the Majestic Theatre on April 9, 1972 after 14 previews and closed on June 23, 1973 after 505 performances. The opening night cast included Robert Morse as Jerry/Daphne, Tony Roberts as Joe/Josephine, Elaine Joyce as Sugar Kane, Cyril Ritchard as Osgood Fielding, Jr., Sheila Smith as Sweet Sue, and Steve Condos as Spats Palazzo.

As for Bob Merrill's lyrics, they are the labored products of a man hovering over a rhyming dictionary. \"Sugar\" is almost a textbook case of a musical born after its time. It may well enjoy great wads of audience favor. But in the past three years, \"Company\" and \"Follies\" have altered the critical perspective by providing a musical form that is spare, intelligent, ironic, mature and capable of sustaining three-dimensional characters.\" He concluded, \"This is not to say that the big, old-fashioned musical is irrevocably doomed, but it must have a singular mood, manner and meaning all its own. Otherwise, all that remains, as \"Sugar\" indicates, is a sterile display of high-gloss techniques.\"\n\nDyan McBride, director of a 2012 San Francisco production of the musical, noted in an interview that \"Written in 1972, \"Sugar\" really has one of the last Golden Age of Broadway scores... You can feel contemporary Broadway starting to come... This is not a rock 'n' roll score; this is really a jazzy score.

It used to have a gross floor area of 120,000 square meters in the past when it was opened on November 8, 1985, a challenging period in the Philippines' political history with the EDSA Revolution just months away.\n\nThe mall's redevelopment began with the opening of The Block in July 2006. Among the developments were a new Annex building which opened in December 2008, and Sky Garden which opened in May 2009. The Car Park Plaza transformed into a lifestyle center in 2009. SM City North EDSA, a work in progress with the renovation of the City Center, and the development of the North Link.\n\nSM City North EDSA was built in a land which was then a marshland in a relatively remote location amidst a political crisis which saw interest rates to rise as high as 45 percent. The lot was previously owned by the Government Service Insurance System and was originally intended to be used to host houses for public school teachers. The mall opened on November 8, 1985. It was the first mall built by SM Prime Holdings Inc. and initially only had SM's fifth department store and first supermarket as its tenants. and at that time it had a gross floor area of 23 square meters.\n\nAs more tenants and entertainment venues were added, The SM City North EDSA then came to be known as the mall that institutionalized the \"one-stop\" shopping concept in the Philippines. It was the first to introduce \"malling\" as a pastime in the Philippines. A 4-level carpark, also known as the Annex 1, was constructed in February 1988; with the lower ground floor converted into an enclosed retail space. Another level was also added on its main mall. On July 28, 1989, a two-floor annex, also known as the original \"Annex 2\" was built providing more leasable space, a bowling alley and four additional movie houses. The main building and the annexes were expanded with a lower ground level, and the first level of The Carpark Plaza was converted into Cyberzone, a section reserved mainly for technology and gadget retail.\n\nOver the years, SM City North EDSA had seen four expansions and redevelopment, including the construction of Annex 3, which opened in 2006. On July 28, 2006, Annex 3, also known as The Block was opened featuring a hypermarket, its flagship toy store, an additional four movie theaters, retail shops, and restaurants. On February 8, 2007, as part of its massive redevelopment plan, the original Annex 2 was completely demolished and construction of a new building started. The current Annex 2 was reopened on December 12, 2008.\n\nFor two years (2014-2016), the SM City North EDSA was named as the largest solar-powered shopping mall in Southeast Asia for the installation of 5,760 solar panels, until that record was surpassed in May 2016 by the Robinsons Starmills Pampanga in San Fernando, Pampanga.\n\nSince its inception in 1985, and the construction of the original Car Park Plaza in February 1988 and the second Annex Building in July 1989, SM City North EDSA Complex's current edifice within the complex are composed of the City Center, Interior Zone (including the Car Park Plaza), The Annex, The Block, The Sky Garden, The Northlink, and The North Towers. The complex has further expanded beyond which is interconnected by a series of footbridges linked to different sides of the main mall structure.\n\nOpened on November 8, 1985, the original building consisted of only three floors. Its original structure has evolved through the years. The City Center has a total of 190,000 Gross Floor Area. Its fourth floor has recently been added to keep up with demand. The newly renovated city center has spherical skylights. As the hub of the retail complex, the City Center has various retail establishments, including the mall's main anchors: The SM Store (formerly SM Department Store) and the SM Supermarket. It is also the hub of leisure anchors such as SM Foodcourt, an entertainment center, and a newly modernized cineplex that incorporate the country's second IMAX Theater. The main dining establishments of the City Center are situated on the second level, where they break through the frontage in a sequence of linear casements which overlook the Sky Garden.\n\nThe Car Park Plaza or Annex 1 was the first additional building, built in February 1988. The original structure was a four-level parking lot. In the early 2000's the open-parking area right beside it were built up and made into its horizontal expansion to accommodate more vehicles and to integrate the newly constructed The Block. In the 2010's the building was expanded again this time vertically to by two floors via a steel structure that also integrated rooftop solar panels. The Car Park Plaza features the first outlet of the Cyberzone, which was later moved to The Annex building, and an additional 8,000 parking slots.

The total Gross floor area of Interior Zone is \n\nToday, the former Car Park and Cyberzone has been transformed into a \"lifestyle center\", named the Interior Zone, which opened in July 2009 and planned by Architects EAT from Australia, the 300 meter long \"lifestyle center\" is a shop for furniture, houseware, decor, upholstery, wallpaper, tiles and lighting fixtures. Also on the Annex 1 is a solar power plant located on the seventh level which features the installation of 5,760 solar panels that can generate up to 1.5 MW of power, which makes SM City North EDSA as the world's largest solar-powered shopping mall for two years until Robinsons Starmills in San Fernando, Pampanga reclaimed the title in 2016.\n\nThe original Annex 2 was built on July 28, 1989 (formerly The SM City Annex), consisting of three floors, as an expansion to the City Center. It featured close to 200 shops and restaurants; aside from four additional movie houses it also catered a bingo hall, an amusement center and a bowling alley. The lower ground floor (or basement) also served as the former administration office of SM City North EDSA along with a few beauty clinics and a junior anchor, Hardware Workshop. A footbridge was constructed at the left side of the City Center to have easy access to the mall. On February 20, 2002, the four movie houses were closed and on February 8, 2007, the original Annex 2 was closed and demolished as part of SM City North EDSA Complex's redevelopment plan.\n\nOn December 12, 2008, it reopened with high-end retails stores, specialty restaurants, a Cyberzone, a game arcade and a new bowling center. The current Annex 2 measured . Like The Block, The Annex has an exterior with undulating aquamarine ribbon consisting of perforated metal panels. The Annex has a curvilinear atrium, which stretches its length. In June 2009, SM City North EDSA reopened its bowling center located on the lower ground floor.\n\nThe Block, formerly one of the wide open parking areas to the right of the main building, was opened on July 28, 2006, this mall has five levels of retail shops and restaurants, four high-digital cinemas, and a 10,000 square meter SM Hypermarket on the ground level. The Block's architectural design is centered on a large oval courtyard, which has become a location for events and products launches. This is crisscrossed by multiple bridges on several levels and is lit through large circular skylights. The Block contained most of the high-end anchor stores owned or operated by SM which includes but is not limited to H&M, Uniqlo, Forever 21, and Vikings. \n\nSeveral bridge connections integrated The Block with the existing mall and carpark areas as well as the Skygarden and the North Towers.\n\nThe North Link is the latest addition to the complex. It is a six-storey structure primarily hosting BPO and other office tenants along with some retail stores. It is connected to other parts of the wall through bridgeways. The Northlink has an open deck at its top which is used for private use of the mall.\n\nA panoramic building with 5 cascading towers named the North Towers is located in the former site of the Super Sale Club warehouse beside The Block. The shortest tower facing North Avenue will be the Park Inn by Radisson Blu Hotel North EDSA while the remaining towers will be used as office spaces. The official opening of the mall component named The North Towers Mall happened on December 7, 2018. The building will be done in two phases, first involves the North Tower Mall and the 3 front buildings while the second phase involves the completion of the two remaining and tallest buildings. The overall Gross floor area of North Tower Mall is \n\nThe Sky Garden is a long, elevated curvilinear park which opened in May 2009. The Sky Garden's water features include two bubblers, a simulated river flowing at the central part of the park, and waterfalls at the end of the second floor which can also be used as a screen where promotional materials can be projected. The main feature of the Sky Garden's feature is the Sky Dome, an events venue which has a seating capacity of 1,500 seating and a floor area measuring .\n\nThe SM Cyber West Avenue is a 15-level structure that covers more than 42,000 square meters of GFA, and around 22,700 square meters of GLA for office space. The building is linked via Bridgeway to the SM North EDSA Mall Complex as well as the future nearby common station. It is targeted primarily for a business process outsourcing or BPO companies which houses Emerson Electric, Concentrix and Convergys. It sits on a 2,910 sq m. property at the corner of the main EDSA thoroughfare and West Avenue. The remaining leasable area mostly found on the ground and second levels feature a Save More supermarket and other support retail and commercial establishments.\n\nA 43 floor, three tower condominium complex owned and developed by SM Development Corporation (SMDC). Currently, Towers 4 and 5 was opened since 4th Quarter of 2017 and 2nd Quarter of 2018, which was known as \"Fern Residences\".\n\nThe first tower (Tower 1) was opened since 4th Quarter of 2017, while the second tower opened since 2nd Quarter (Tower 2) of 2018. The name of the first tower was known as \"Wilmington\" and the second tower was named \"Berkshire\".\n\nThere was a Warehouse building situated on a two-hectare lot within the SM City North EDSA Complex houses the former Super Sale Club. Sometime in 2008, it was leased to of its junior anchors, Ace Hardware and Bingo Bonanza, where both later moved to The Annex when it opened. After that, Kotse Network leased a portion of the Warehouse building. Part of the building was converted into a parking lot for its valet service until its subsequent demolition to give way for the North Towers.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7741889", "categories": ["Shopping malls established in 1985", "Shopping malls in Quezon City", "SM Prime Holdings"], "title": "SM City North EDSA"}

He was the eldest son of lieutenant colonel Fredrik Anders Jägerhorn and Ulrika Sofia Brunow. Colonel Fredrik Adolf Jägerhorn, vice commander of the Sveaborg fortress in 1808 was Johan Anders' brother.\n\nThe Jägerhorn af Spurila noble family tree can be documented to 15th century Finland with legends - inspired by the Song of Roland - going back to the 12th century when Swedish crusader king Eric the Saint of Sweden came to Finland and made an early ancestor of the family squire of the king.\n\nJohan Anders Jägerhorn was a military officer with the rank of major in the Swedish army and lieutenant colonel in the Russian army 1789.\n\nAs a participant in an officers’ plot against the Swedish king in Finland 1788, Jägerhorn advocated sovereignty for Finland. Condemned to death by the Swedes on the ground of treason, he was exiled to Germany. In Hamburg he befriended Lord Edward FitzGerald and acted as an intermediary between the Irish and the French before the rebellion of 1798. After two years’ imprisonment (1799–1801) in the Tower of London, he returned to Finland and was instrumental in shaping the constitution of newly autonomous Finland. After having been part of the Swedish kingdom for more than 600 years, Finland became an autonomous Russian Grand Duchy in 1809. Jägerhorn was thus one of the historical originators of Finnish independence. Finland declared independence on 6 December 1917.\n\nJohan Anders Jägerhorn was the founder and leader of a secret order called Walhalla-orden with its seat in the Suomenlinna fortress.\n\nHe was married to Ulrika Sofia Blomcreutz of Swedish nobility in 1783. Jägerhorn died in Porvoo, Finland on 6 March 1825. His only two daughters had died at early age in tragic accidents.\n\nIn 1981, Minister Desmond O'Malley of Ireland unveiled a commemorative plaque adorning Jägerhorn’s house in Porvoo, Finland and stated: \"If this man has spent 2 years of prison for the independence of Ireland, he is indeed worthy of this plaque.\"\n\n", "id": "7741897", "categories": ["Finnish exiles", "Russian military personnel", "19th-century Finnish people", "People from Vantaa", "Finnish nobility", "Swedish-speaking Finns", "18th-century Finnish people", "1825 deaths", "1757 births", "Swedish military personnel"], "title": "Johan Anders Jägerhorn"}

With its comic references to \"The Exorcist\" and \"Audition\", \"Buppah Rahtree\" gained a cult following through screenings at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival and the Fantasia Festival. Its sequels are (2005), Rahtree Reborn (Buppha Rahtree 3.1) (2009) and Rahtree Revenge (Buppha Rahtree 3.2) (2009).\n\nBuppah Rahtree is a loner female student at a Bangkok university who becomes the object of a wager by a group of male students to see if she can be bedded. Ake, the son of a wealthy family, takes the bet and courts young Buppah. She resists him at first, but one day sees him feeding pigeons in a park and talks to him. After she expresses her desire to fly away, they go on a ride in Ake's convertible. They continue to have a relationship, which culminates in a three-day weekend at Bang Saen, during which Ake has sex with her; he stays in bed with her the whole time. Ake shows videotapes of their sex to his friends, and for his efforts wins a bottle of Johnnie Walker, which he reflects to himself seems like a trivial prize for messing up another person's life. Ake breaks off all contact with Buppah.\n\nAfter her stepfather gives her a car ride, he takes her to a short-time hotel and sexually assaults her. She stabs him with a fountain pen he gaver her as a present and runs home to her apartment. Depressed, she contemplates suicide but is interrupted by a phone call from Ake, who wants to meet her. Ake tells her about the wager and apologizes. Though he plans to leave Thailand to study in England, he hopes to maintain their friendship. Buppah informs Ake she is two months' pregnant. Ake's mother tells him to convince Buppah to have an abortion. After the operation, he drives her back to her apartment, and it is obvious she is in pain. Ake leaves to get rice congee but does not return.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully attempting to collect rent, Buppah's landlady breaks into the apartment, where she discovers Buppah's corpse; Buppah bled to death due to complications from the abortion. When the authorities arrive, Buppah revives, and her vengeful spirit refuses to be dislodged. Mrs. See calls upon Maew, a false shaman who hustles locals, to exorcise the spirit. When he fails, Maew convinces his teacher, Master Tong, to try. For his effort, Master Tong is left with a knife in his back. A pair of Roman Catholic priests perform an exorcism, only to end up curse at and vomited upon by the ghost. As Buppah haunts the building, residents leave in droves, ruining Mrs. See's finances.\n\nIn England, Ake grows homesick and has turned to drug use. He returns to Thailand and offers to bring Buppah rice congee. Ake catches the eye of Muay, a young woman at the congee stand. Muay seduces Ake and has him take her to an old cinema, where they have sex. When Ake returns to Buppah's apartment, he has forgotten the congee. Buppah knows that Ake has cheated on her, and for his transgression, she amputates his legs. Muay comes to the apartment to find Ake. Buppah takes possession of Muay's body and compels Muay to cut her own legs off.\n\nMrs. See recruits a genuine shaman from Cambodia. The shaman and his men come to the apartment just as Muay is being possessed. They put a spirit cloth over Ake and on Buppah's corpse. Through a prayer, the shaman puts Buppah's spirit back into the corpse. They plan to take Buppah to a temple to be cremated, but on the way, the spirit cloth blows off the body, which is in the back of a pickup truck. Buppah takes control of the vehicle and causes it to crash into another truck.\n\nMuay, saddened by the turn of events, makes contact with Ake's father, who is angered and puzzled by the call. As it turns out, Ake has been dead for more than a month. Muay had sexual relations with Ake's ghost.\n\nBuppah returns to her apartment, where she will likely stay for eternity. Ake's ghost, now legless, sits outside in the hallway and apologizes to Buppah for the rest of his ghost eternity.\n\n\nA soundtrack album, Original Motion Picture Soundtrack: Buppah Rahtree, was released to accompany the film. It features a mix of Thai hip hop and pop music. Most of the tracks feature members of Joey Boy's rap collective Gancore Club, the heavyset duo BZ and Fukking Hero, who were also featured in the film as residents of a neighboring apartment to Rahtree's.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7741916", "categories": ["Thai films", "2003 films", "Ghost films", "Thai horror films", "Thai-language films"], "title": "Buppah Rahtree"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741928", "text": "Adobe AIR\n\nAdobe AIR (formerly Adobe Integrated Runtime) is a cross-platform runtime system developed by Adobe Systems for building desktop applications and mobile applications, programmed using Adobe Animate, ActionScript and optionally Apache Flex. The runtime supports installable applications on Windows, OS X and mobile operating systems including Android, iOS and BlackBerry Tablet OS. It also originally ran on Linux, but support was discontinued as of version 2.6 in 2011.\n\nAdobe AIR is a runtime environment that allows Adobe Animate content and ActionScript 3.0 coders to construct applications and video games that run as a stand alone app and behave similar to a native application on supported platforms. A Flash Player or HTML5 application used in a browser does not require installation, while AIR applications require installation from an installer file (Windows and OS X) or the appropriate App Store (iOS and Android). AIR applications have unrestricted access to local storage and file systems, while browser-based applications only have access to individual files selected by users.\n\nAdobe AIR internally uses a shared codebase with the Flash Player rendering engine and ActionScript 3.0 as the primary programming language. Applications must specifically be built for Adobe AIR to use additional features provided, such as multi-touch, file system integration, native client extensions, integration with Taskbar or Dock, and access to accelerometer and GPS devices. HTML5 applications may run on the WebKit engine included in AIR.\n\nNotable applications built with Adobe AIR include eBay Desktop, Pandora One desktop, TweetDeck, the former Adobe Media Player, Angry Birds, and Machinarium, among other multimedia and task management applications. According to Adobe, over 100,000 unique applications have been built on AIR, and over 1 billion installations of the same were logged from users across the world, as of May 2014. Adobe AIR was voted as the \"Best Mobile Application Development\" product at the Consumer Electronics Show for two consecutive years (CES 2014 and CES 2015).\nUsing AIR, developers can access functionality including text, vector graphics, raster graphics, video, audio, camera, and microphone capability. Adobe AIR also includes additional features such as file system integration, native client extensions, desktop integration and access to connected devices. AIR enables applications to work with data in different ways, including using local files, local SQLite databases (for which AIR has built-in support), a database server, or the encrypted local store included with AIR.\n\nDevelopers can access additional functionality by building AIR Native Extensions, which can access full device functionality being programmed in the native language.\n\nOn desktop platforms, AIR supports:\n\nOn mobile platforms, AIR supports many mobile hardware features:\n\nIn 2011, the addition of Stage3D allowed AIR apps access to GPUs for hardware acceleration. Several third-party frameworks have been developed to build upon the functionality of Stage3D, including the Starling Framework and Away3D. These frameworks are also compatible with AIR, and provide vital performance improvements to AIR apps published for mobile devices.\n\nAIR apps can be augmented in functionality with the usage of AIR Native Extensions (ANEs). Native extensions are plug-in code libraries that contain native code wrapped with an ActionScript API, allowing developers to access native features not otherwise usable in AIR, such as Apple Game Center or Google Cloud Messaging.\n\nNative extensions may be developed by anyone using publicly available tools; some are distributed for free or even as open source, while others are sold commercially.\n\nNative extensions may be programmed in the native language on each platform, allowing access to the full set of platform APIs provided by the developer. (C++ for Windows, Java for Android, Objective-C for iOS).\n\nAIR is a cross-platform technology and AIR applications can be repackaged with few or no changes for many popular desktop and mobile platforms. Different installation options exist for each platform.\n\nAIR applications may be published with or without the AIR runtime. Applications packaged with the AIR runtime are larger in file size, and are known as \"captive runtime\" applications. If the runtime is not embedded in the app, it must be installed separately.\n\nIn January 2009, Adobe claimed that there were over 100 million installations of Adobe AIR worldwide, and that \"the majority of AIR runtime installations occur at the time the first AIR application is installed by a user\". In May 2014, Adobe claimed that over 100,000 unique applications were built on AIR, and over 1 billion installations of the same were logged from users across the world.\n\nThe latest version of Adobe AIR, version 28, contains Adobe Flash Player 28, and is available for Windows 7 and later, as well as OS X 10.9 and later. Official support for desktop Linux distributions ceased in June 2011 with version 2.6.\n\nAdobe AIR applications can be published as native phone applications on certain mobile operating systems, such as Android (ARM Cortex-A8 and above) and Apple iOS.\nAdobe AIR runs applications within a contained Flash Player instance. It runs web applications via WebKit rendering engine. Multiple instances of the browser can be started within a single AIR application, but JavaScript content executes with some security limitations.\n\nAIR does not provide direct access to native GUI elements such as navigation bars or controls. Native extensions can be used to access additional native resources.\n\nThe AIR SDK is available as a free standalone download for software developers to make AIR applications. SDK users do not need to install any commercial software to use the SDK, although several options are available. AIR apps can be compiled from the command line using the AIR compiler included in the SDK; the compiler can also be called from an IDE to eliminate the need for the command line.\n\nAIR can also be used with Adobe Flex. Flex is an integrated collection of stylable graphical user interface, data manipulation and networking components, and applications built upon it are known as \"Flex\" applications. Flex GUIs are defined in MXML, similar to how Android and Microsoft Visual Studio define GUIs; however, Flex does not give access to native GUI components.\n\nAIR applications built without the Flex framework allow greater flexibility and performance, and are known as \"pure ActionScript\" applications. Video games built on the AIR platform are typically pure-Actionscript projects. Various open-source component frameworks are available for pure ActionScript projects, such as \"MadComponents\", that provide UI Components at significantly smaller SWF file sizes.\n\nAdobe distributes three commercial software products for developing of AIR applications in ActionScript:\n\nThird-party development environments that target the AIR runtime are also available, including:\n\nAdobe Flash Builder is the premium tool for Flex application development, since it includes an integrated drag-and-drop user interface builder, not found in competing tools like FlashDevelop.\n\nAdobe provides for AIR HTML5 and JavaScript development with Adobe Dreamweaver CS5, although any other HTML editor or text editor can be used.\n\nAdobe AIR can run a subset of JavaScript, with no ability to dynamically execute code when running in the application sandbox. According to Adobe, this restriction is designed to prevent malicious remote content from attacking a user's system. Because of this restriction, JavaScript frameworks that make use of dynamic JavaScript functions like eval() were not initially compatible with Adobe AIR. However, several frameworks including Dojo Toolkit, jQuery, and ExtJS were updated to run in Adobe AIR's application sandbox. Some frameworks like MooTools were already compatible.\n\nDreamweaver CS4/CS3 requires an additional extension to compile AIR applications, as does Flash CS3 in the form of an update.\n\nAdobe made a public preview release of AIR (then called Apollo) along with a software development kit (SDK) and extension for developing Apollo applications with the Flex framework, on March 19, 2007.\n\nOn June 10, 2007, Apollo was renamed to AIR and a public beta release of the runtime was launched. Public beta 2 of AIR SDK was released on October 1, 2007. Public beta 3, was released on December 12, 2007.\n\nVersion 1.0 of the Adobe AIR runtime and SDK was released on February 25, 2008.\n\nVersion 1.1 of Adobe AIR was released on June 16, 2008. This release included a number of new features including:\n\nIn addition, version 1.1 works on Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and 64-bit editions of Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, and Enterprise.\n\nAdobe AIR 1.5 was released on November 17, 2008. New capabilities included:\n\nReleased on February 24, 2009, AIR 1.5.1 was primarily a compatibility update that includes bug fixes and security updates.\n\nReleased on July 30, 2009, AIR 1.5.2 introduced a number of minor new features and compatibility issues. Some of the important fixes included:\n\nAdobe AIR 1.5.3 was released on December 8, 2009. It included fixes for a number of compatibility and security related issues. The BBC iPlayer Desktop manager v1.5.15695.18135 is the first version to use AIR 1.5.3.\n\nThe Adobe AIR 2 public beta was released on November 16, 2009 followed by the beta 2 on February 2, 2010 and the release candidate on May 11, 2010. In addition, Adobe AIR for Android was announced on February 12, 2010. AIR 2 was officially released for Windows, Mac OS and Linux on June 10, 2010 and Android on October 8, 2010. It dropped the ability to run on PowerPC Macs.\n\nAdobe AIR 2.5 was released on October 24, 2010 at the Adobe MAX 2010 conference.\n\nAdobe AIR 2.6 was released on February 24, 2011 for Android devices.

Among the factors that brought this about, one stood out in his own mind: at school religion was taught without life or understanding. Ghéon did not miss it. As F. J. Sheed says, \"His was a happy atheism.\" He replaced Catholicism with a semi-pagan cult of beauty in all its forms — nature, literature, music, painting.\n\nHe moved to Paris in 1893 to study medicine. Around the same time, he started to write poetry, along with his colleagues Francis Jammes and Stéphane Mallarmé. He also published avant garde criticism. In 1887 he met André Gide, who became his literary guide and friend for twenty years. Ghéon, writes Gide's biographer Alan Sheridan, \"was Gide's closest friend and companion on innumerable homosexual exploits.\" Ghėon actually drafted a militant text in favour of homosexuality, \"La Vie secrète de Guillaume Arnoult\", which was one of the inspirations for Gide's \"Corydon\". In 1909 they were founding members of the Nouvelle Revue Française (NRF). Ghéon also painted, studied music and travelled widely.\n\nIt was the sceptic Gide who occasioned the first cracks in Ghéon's paganism when he invited him to visit Florence with him in 1912. There Ghéon discovered the religious art of Giotto and Fra Angelico and was overwhelmed to the point of shedding tears. \"At St Mark's,\" he wrote, \"with Christ dying on the cross and the Virgin waiting for the angel in a bare and silent corridor..., even our senses had a soul. Art had transported me before, but never so high.\"\n\nHe served as an army doctor in the First World War. During this period he regained his Catholic faith, as described in his work \"L'homme né de la guerre\" (\"The Man Born from the War\"). His conversion was bound up with a devoutly Catholic naval officer, Pierre Dominique Dupouey, whom he met only three times in the space of a few weeks, but who impressed him greatly. It was again Gide who was the occasion for this fateful encounter: when Ghéon left for the Belgian front, Gide urged him to try to find Dupouey, who had once been his disciple and with whom he still corresponded. On Holy Saturday, 1915, Dupouey was killed in action on the Yser. By Christmas, Ghéon had returned to the Catholic faith.\n\nHe founded the \"Compagnons de Notre Dame\" (Companions of Our Lady), a sort of amateur theatre confraternity of young people, for which he wrote over 60 plays, usually on episodes from the Gospel or the lives of the saints. Ghéon's plays had clear similarities with the medieval mystery and miracle plays. The Companions of Our Lady performed with success in Paris and throughout France, as well as in Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, and Ghéon was awarded a prize for his work by the Académie française. He also wrote poems, saints' biographies, and novels, among them a three-part work, \"Les Jeux de l'enfer et du ciel\" (\"Games of Hell and Heaven\"), centred on the Curè d'Ars.\n\nGhéon died of cancer in a Paris clinic on June 13, 1944, a week after the Allied landing in Normandy and six days after the opening of his most recent play, \"Saint Gilles\".\n\nIn 2008 the writer and philosopher Fabrice Hadjadj, reviewing Catherine Boschian-Campaner's biography of Ghéon in \"Le Figaro\", wrote, \"Henri Ghėon is not a minor writer and his work speaks for itself. If his novels recall Dickens, his theatre loses nothing in comparison with Anouilh and Giraudoux. It was he alone who, in the first half of the 20th century, revived the popular burlesque and verticality of the medieval mystery plays, thus anticipating Dario Fo.\"\n\nHis \"Miroir de Peine\" was set to music by Hendrik Andriessen.\n\n\n", "id": "7741936", "categories": ["French-language LGBT writers", "1875 births", "Converts to Roman Catholicism from atheism or agnosticism", "People from Seine-et-Marne", "19th-century French novelists", "20th-century French dramatists and playwrights", "Gay writers", "LGBT dramatists and playwrights", "LGBT novelists", "1944 deaths", "French Roman Catholics", "LGBT poets", "French poets", "LGBT writers from France", "LGBT Roman Catholics", "French biographers", "French medical writers", "Roman Catholic writers", "19th-century French dramatists and playwrights", "20th-century French male writers", "20th-century French novelists", "19th-century French male writers", "Deaths from cancer in France"], "title": "Henri Ghéon"}

He recruited Dr. Charles Drew to help develop the organization and its processes to get the plasma supply project operational. Their work was estimated to have helped save the lives of thousands of Allied troops.\n\nScudder was born to John and Ellen Bartholemew Scudder in 1900 in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Rutgers University before deciding to be a surgeon. He completed medical school at Columbia University, where he also did graduate-level work on blood research and surgical procedures for its use. \n\nHis family was part of the Scudders in India, who devoted more than 1,100 combined years to Christian medical mission service. Four generations of the family and 42 members served in India.\n\nAfter obtaining his doctorate, Scudder began working and teaching at Columbia University-Presbyterian Hospital. There he worked in blood transfusion and surgery. He became an assistant professor of clinical surgery at Columbia University in 1935. He worked on research centering on whole blood, then on fractionated blood and plasmas. By 1940 he was doing research on blood fluid dynamics as well.\n\nIn late 1939, after World War II began in Europe, the Blood Transfusion Betterment Association (BTBA) of New York met with certain members of the British medical establishment about transfusion techniques. Plasma transfusion was possible at that time, but still experimental. No one had a good method for supplementing Britain's supplies with American blood plasma. This was crucial since, by all expectations, any war was expected to have the high casualties similar to those of World War I. \n\nThe managers of the BTBA turned to Dr. Scudder to organize the project. He recruited Charles Drew, one of his brightest graduate students and recently minted PhD, to lead the project. During the course of Plasma for Britain, Scudder often assisted Drew in organizing and communicating with project managers and other medical authorities. When Plasma for Britain was turned over to the British Military, Scudder returned to his teaching and research position at Columbia.\n\nScudder continued research in fields related both to blood work and surgery. He published papers on shock syndrome, banked blood, and using chemicals and X-rays to map the cardiovascular system. He co-authored many papers. \n\nIn the 1960s, when there was a conflict between the Red Cross and the for-profit American Association of Blood Banks, Scudder publicly supported the Red Cross. He stated that blood donation should be a matter of civic responsibility, not profiteering. \n\nHis health began to fail in the early 1970s. He died in December 1976 at the age of 76..\n\n\n\n", "id": "7741988", "categories": ["1971 deaths", "American hematologists", "Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alumni"], "title": "John Scudder (physician)"}

It is scored for soprano, mixed choir and orchestra or chamber ensemble.\n\nFive of its seven movements are based on text from the Latin Requiem Mass, while the second movement is a setting of \"Out of the deep\" (Psalm 130) and the sixth movement is an anthem \"The Lord is my Shepherd\" (Psalm 23) which Rutter had earlier written. The first movement combines the Introit and Kyrie, the third is \"Pie Jesu\", with soprano solo. The central movement is a lively Sanctus, followed by Agnus Dei and finally Lux aeterna. In the Agnus Dei and Lux aeterna, Rutter combines the liturgical Latin text with English biblical verses.\n\nFour of the movements of the Requiem were first performed at Fremont Presbyterian Church, Sacramento, California, on 14 March 1985. The first performance of the complete work was at Lovers' Lane United Methodist Church, Dallas, Texas, on 13 October 1985. It was published in 1986 by Oxford University Press\nRutter completed his Requiem in 1985. It bears the dedication \"in memoriam L. F. R.\", John Rutter's father, who had died the previous year.\n\nHe conducted the first performance on 13 October 1985 at Lovers' Lane United Methodist Church, Dallas, Texas, where the director of Music Allen Pote prepared the Sanctuary Choir and orchestra. Movements 1, 2, 4, and 7 had been performed on 14 March 1985 at Fremont Presbyterian Church, Sacramento, California, by the Sanctuary Choir and ensemble, prepared by Mel Olson and also conducted by the composer.\n\nThe Requiem was published in 1986 by Oxford University Press, with a singable English text also for the Latin passages.\n\nRutter scored the Requiem for mixed choir and orchestra. It features solos for cello, soprano and oboe. He prepared two versions, one for a chamber ensemble and one for orchestra. The ensemble consists of flute, oboe, timpani, glockenspiel, harp, cello and organ, while the orchestra has 2 flutes, oboe, 2 clarinets, bassoon, 2 horns, timpani, glockenspiel, harp and strings.\nRutter structured the work in seven movements, similar to the setting of Gabriel Fauré. One of the movements is \"The Lord is my Shepherd\", which he had written as an anthem in 1976.\n\nThe following table shows the title, Tempo marking, voices, time, key and text sources for the seven movements. The information is given for the beginning of the movements. Rutter frequently shifts tempo, key and time. The source for the details is the vocal score, unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe first movement consists of the Introit from the Requiem (\"Requiem aeternam\") and the Kyrie. The work opens with a steady beat of the tympani, to which instruments enter, first without a defined key. The voices enter in measure 7, stating in unison on the note C \"Requiem aeternam\". The text beginning \"Kyrie eleison\" is set in G major.\n\nThe second movement is entitled \"Out of the Deep\", the English version of Psalm 130, a psalm commonly used at Anglican funerals. It is set in C minor and begins with an expanded cello solo. Its motifs are picked up by the voices, first alto and bass in unison, in low register.\n\nThe third movement is the \"Pie Jesu\", a text that concludes the sequence Dies irae. Rutter, as before him Fauré and Duruflé, omit the sequence, but include the prayer to Jesus for rest. It begins with a soprano soloist singing with a very light accompaniment, with only slight involvement of the chorus echoing the words \"Dona eis requiem, Dona eis sempiternam requiem\".\n\nThe central movement is the Sanctus (with Benedictus), a lively, and exclamatory movement which is brightly orchestrated with bells, flute, and oboe and occasional timpani recalling the passage in Old Testament scripture in Isaiah chapter 6, and the worship of the six-winged seraphim in the heavenly throne-room of God.\n\nThe fifth movement is the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) of the Requiem. Rutter uses a steady beat on one note, similar to the timpani of the first movement. The Latin text is contrasted with another biblical passage, \"Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live\" from the Book of Job. The call Agnus Dei in measure 58 is the dynamic climax of the Requiem. After an instrumental interlude which quotes a melody associated with Easter, the voices sing very softly \"I am the resurrection and the life\", from the Book of John.\n\nThe sixth movement is Psalm 23, another psalm commonly used at Anglican funerals. It mentions the valley of the shadow of death, but is an expression of trust in God and hope for dwelling in his house forever.\n\nThe seventh movement includes words from the 1662 \"Book of Common Prayer\" Burial Service (\"I heard a voice from heaven...\") and the communion chant from Requiem (\"Lux aeterna\").\n\nThe work lasts about 40 minutes.\n\n\n", "id": "7742027", "categories": ["Compositions by John Rutter", "Psalm settings", "1985 compositions"], "title": "Requiem (Rutter)"}

I think it is possible to make the sentence of forced labour more effective, more moralising, less expensive and more humane by using it to further the progress of French colonisation.\"\"\n\nThe first batch of prisoners left the Breton port of Brest for the Îles du Salut on 31 March 1852. The prison at St-Laurent-du-Maroni was established on the banks of the Maroni River on 21 February 1858. All the prisoners sent from France were taken there before being transferred to other prisons or camps. The town of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni proper was founded on 16 March 1880; it was a penal town whose inhabitants were nearly all guards or liberated prisoners. The hospital was built in 1912, and the prison itself closed in 1946, the same year the whole colonial penal system was abolished.\n\nThe prison at Saint-Laurent was but a temporary stop for most prisoners. Only a small number of men ever stayed in Saint-Laurent for long, and they were nearly all employed in the penitentiary administration or were considered harmless and unlikely to try to escape.\n\nWhen a ship (such as \"La Loire\" or \"La Martinière\") arrived from Saint-Martin-de-Ré, the first order of the day was to separate the \"\"chevaux de retour\"\" (literally \"returned horses\", but meaning the escaped prisoners) and the recidivists from the rest, to send them to the Îles du Salut, from whose shores escape was considered impossible. (A few, however, succeeded; most famously, Henri Charrière, who later wrote \"\"Papillon\"\".) The new prisoners then stayed for a while in Saint-Laurent, where they were sorted into different camps or prisons. The ones considered to be shifty and eager to escape were sent to the islands along with the recidivists and ex-escapees. The least dangerous men, condemned to prison for petty offences, were offered jobs in the penitentiary administration. The prisoners were also separated by nationality, as there were special camps reserved for those from Indochina, and the Arabs often became guards.\n\nSince there was a hospital in Saint-Laurent, many prisoners faked illnesses to get sent there, where they had plenty of time to plot escapes (as experienced and written by, among others, Charrière). Since many prisoners worked in the hospital, this was not terribly hard to do.\n\nThose who were lucky enough to stay in Saint-Laurent were generally better treated than prisoners in other camps. Their work was simple, they were free to go wherever they wanted inside the prison, and were given better rations.\n\n\n", "id": "7742100", "categories": ["History of French Guiana"], "title": "Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni"}

Former names are \"Gay Enterprise\" and Solent Enterprise.\n\nThe vessel was built in 1971 for the Gosport Ferry service by James and Stone of Brightlingsea, primarily for cruising Portsmouth Harbour and the Solent. Originally called \"Gay Enterprise\", the name was changed in the winter of 1979, during her standby ferry duties, to \"Solent Enterprise\". It had a similar design to the company's two 1966 \"Queens\" (\"Portsmouth Queen\" and \"Gosport Queen\") but the interior was more comfortable because of its different duty. It was painted in later years in a blue livery with a large \"Solent Enterprise\" banner on its side barriers. In its later years of service, it was regularly used on ferry duties between Gosport and Portsmouth when either of the \"Queens\" were out of service. In 2001, Gosport Ferry Company purchased a new ferry, the \"Spirit of Gosport\", but the company also wanted to replace the \"Solent Enterprise\" in its cruising role. Both \"Queens\" therefore stayed on, and the \"Spirit of Gosport\" only had a few ferry duties in its first few months. In 2005, another new vessel was purchased, \"Spirit of Portsmouth\". This was fitted out with a covered top deck and a bar and to suit its cruise duties. This meant that \"Solent Enterprise\" was no longer required by the Gosport Ferry service and she was sold to Capital Pleasure Boats in 2005. Her new owners renamed her \"Sundance\" and she operated on the River Thames in London as a charter vessel catering for parties, corporate entertainment, weddings and other functions. Later, she was sold again and moved to Copenhagen to be used as a floating cafe. However, in the early hours of the morning of 11 February 2016, a fire broke out on board completely engulfing the top deck and left her badly damaged. \"Sundance\" was repaired and turned back into a houseboat but remains in Copenhagen today under new ownership.\n\n", "id": "7742138", "categories": ["Gosport Ferry", "Ferries of England"], "title": "Sundance (charter vessel)"}

The journal is currently published by John Wiley & Sons, and is edited by Helen Castle since 2001.\n\nIn its early days, the journal was more concerned with the British scene, but it gradually became more international. In 1946 Monica Pidgeon became editor and developed the magazine under the ownership of Standard Catalogue Company. Contributors during the 1960s included Theo Crosby and Kenneth Frampton.\n\nIt moved away from presenting mostly news towards theme-based issues. During the late 1970s and 1980s it was the bastion of Postmodernism, with frequent articles and special editions guest-edited by Charles Jencks, the theoretical father of postmodern architecture. At that time the journal was the mouthpiece of the publishers Academy Editions (marketed in the USA under St. Martins Press), based in Leinster Gardens, London (they also had their own bookstore), and they published very many well-known titles concerned with postmodernism. The long-standing Editor-in-Chief, until the mid-1980s, was Andreas Papadakis.\n\nThe content of the journal is seen during the latter half of its history as running parallel with the cutting edge of avant-gardism, promoting innovation as well as celebrity status – 'stararchitects'. Thus, at the height of Postmodernism in the late 1970s – when it often featured the works of Michael Graves, Robert Stern, Leon Krier, James Stirling, Robert Krier and Aldo Rossi – it also published Rem Koolhaas's later influential book \"Delirious New York\" (1979). An undercurrent to Postmodernism featured in the journal was that of \"architecture without a style\", a vernacular classical architecture, epitomised by the work of Quinlan Terry, Demetri Porphyrios and John Simpson.\n\nThe journal went partly into decline with the demise of postmodernism, though it then shifted its coverage towards Deconstructivism, folding in architecture, 'blob' architecture, biomorphism, and digital architecture. The shift in emphasis can be pinpointed to a single edition of the journal, devoted to the two polar positions at that time: \"Peter Eisenman versus Leon Krier: 'My ideology is better than yours.'\" ('Architectural Design', 9-10/1989). The current avant-gardist interest of the journal in biomorphism is a return to issues the journal was covering in the 1960s and 1970s, before posism, with the architecture of Archigram, Cedric Price and the thinking of Reyner Banham.\n\nThe publication became part of John Wiley & Sons in 1997 when it acquired AD's German publisher VCH who had acquired the title from Andreas Papadakis' Academy Editions in 1991.\n\n", "id": "7742140", "categories": ["Architecture magazines", "British magazines", "Magazines established in 1930", "Architectural design"], "title": "Architectural Design"}

The club runs a number of men's teams including 1st XV (National League 2 South), 2nd XV (Duchy League), Colts and a Select XV as well as a number of junior teams from age 7 through to 16. They are one of the most successful club sides in Cornwall, having won the Cornwall Cup 10 times and the Cornwall Super Cup 3 times, and are currently the second highest ranked club side behind the Cornish Pirates. Redruth enjoys a strong a rivalry with neighbours Camborne, with the two clubs meeting annually, in what is the world’s longest enduring rugby fixture.\n\nRedruth RFC was founded in 1875 by Henry Grylls and W H Willimot. By the 1900s, the club was the most successful in Cornwall, a position they were to hold for much of the 20th century. In the 1930s, the team moved to the Recreation Ground near Plain an Gwary. At the time, the Recreation Ground was the third largest rugby ground in England. When the leagues started in 1987, Redruth was in the provincial league of South-West 1, which they won. The team then won the old League Four South in 1991 and gained promotion. In 2005, the club reached its highest-ever ranking by winning promotion into National Division One. The team finished 4th position in the 2006–07 season.\n\nThe Recreation Ground is situated on Cardrew Lane in Redruth, around five minutes walk from the town centre and Redruth railway station. The ground consists of a main pitch with a wooden grandstand alongside the club-house on the west side, and terraced grass banking on the other three sides. The ground also has several bars adjoining the grandstand, and there is also a secondary pitch for 2nd XV and junior fixtures. There is parking for around 100 cars but this is often limited on match-days and it is recommended that supporters park nearby in town. \n\nThe capacity of the Recreation Ground has varied over the decades. Up until the 1980s it was considered the third largest rugby ground in England (behind Twickenham and Leicester Tigers home of Welford Road) with an official capacity of 21,172, which included a number of temporary stands. This capacity was actually exceeded in 1969 when the ground hosted the final of the County Championship between Cornwall and Lancashire, when 25,000 are believed to have watched the game. \n\nThe removal of the temporary stands, coupled with a more zealous approach to safety, saw the grounds capacity reduce to 12,000 in the 1990s to the current capacity (2018) of around 3,500. This modern figure includes 580 seated in the grandstand, the rest standing with approximately 1,500 on the east bank, 800 on the north bank, 400 on the south bank and a further 200 or so in front of the grandstand/next to club house. In 2018 the local police gave an estimate of 3,000 but since Redruth were reported to have achieved an attendance of 4,000 for a National 2 promotion playoff game as recently as 2005, this is a little conservative.\n\nAs one of the traditional rugby powerhouses in Cornwall, Redruth are also one of the best supported, second only to the Cornish Pirates, and, despite mixed fortunes over the past decade, they remain the best supported club in National League 2 South, having topped the attendance charts every year since they arrived in the division during the 2011–12 season. Although the Recreation Ground no longer sees the huge crowds of yesteryear (even for Cornwall games), the 4,000 that attended Redruth's playoff victory against Macclesfield remains the clubs best crowd for a competitive fixture over the past couple of decades. The club also still draws large crowds (1,000+) for the traditional yearly fixture against neighbours Camborne.\n\nBelow is a summary of the club's league attendance since the 2000–01 season. The club enjoyed its best crowds during the 2008–09 season in the old National Division Two, thanks to derby games against fellow Cornish clubs, Launceston and Mounts Bay, both of which drew crowds in excess of 2,000. In recent years attendances at the Recreation Ground have fallen as the club has found itself without a Cornish league derby following the relegation of Launceston at the end of the 2015–16 season. \n\nBelow is a summary of Redruth's performances in competitive rugby since the advent of the leagues in 1987–88.\n\n\nThe colts section is coached by Simon Blake. The team has consistently finished highly in the national Colts competition, and won the U-17s cup and U-18s Cornwall Cup competitions in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7742161", "categories": ["English rugby union teams", "Rugby clubs established in 1875", "Cornish rugby union teams", "Sports clubs in Cornwall"], "title": "Redruth R.F.C."}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742229", "text": "Women in the Russian and Soviet military\n\nWomen in the Russian and Soviet military have played many roles in their country's military history. Women of Russia and the Soviet Union played an important role in World Wars, especially during World War II.\n\nWomen served in the Russian armed forces in small numbers in the early stages of the war, but their numbers increased after heavy Russian losses such as at the Battle of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes and a need for increased manpower. One such recruit was Maria Bochkareva who served with the 25th Reserve Battalion of the Russian Army. After the abdication of Nicholas II of Russia in March 1917, she convinced interim prime minister Alexander Kerensky to let her form a women's battalion. The Women's Battalion recruited women between the ages of 13 and 25 and appealed for support in a series of public meetings, enlisting approximately 2,000 soldiers. The Battalion fought during the June Offensive against German forces in 1917. Three months of fighting reduced their numbers to around two-hundred and fifty.\n\nThe Women's Battalion was disbanded after a failed military coup known as the Kornilov Affair. Its leader, General Lavr Kornilov, had been strongly supported by Bachkarova, and the Women's Battalion were identified as potential sympathizers. The majority of the battalion's members were reformed as the First Petrograd Women's Battalion. This group was at the Winter Palace on the night of the Bolshevik Revolution, along with an untrained cadet detachment and a bicycle regiment. They mounted a resistance but ultimately fell, although there were only 5 deaths in the storming of the Winter Palace. The triumphant Bolsheviks officially disbanded the group. \n\nSeveral women pilots are known from the First World War. Princess Eugenie Shakovskaya was assigned duty as an artillery and reconnaissance pilot, having volunteered for the Imperial Russian Air Service in 1914 (one of the world’s first female military aviators) and flew missions with the 26th Corps Air Squadron in 1917 for nine months. Because of her connections to the Imperial family she was demobilized after the October Revolution. Lyubov A. Golanchikova was a test pilot who contributed her airplane to the Czarist armies; Helen P. Samsonova was assigned to the 5th Corps Air Squadron as a reconnaissance pilot. And in 1915, Nedeshda Degtereva had the distinction of being the first woman pilot to be wounded in combat while on a reconnaissance mission over the Austrian front in Galicia.\n\nWomen played a part in most of the armed forces of the Second World War. In most countries though, women tended to serve mostly in administrative, medical and in auxiliary roles. But in the Soviet Union women fought also in front line roles. Over 800,000 women served in the Soviet armed forces in World War II, mostly as medics and nurses, which is over 3 percent of total personnel; nearly 200,000 of them were decorated. 89 of them eventually received the Soviet Union’s highest award, the Hero of the Soviet Union, they served as pilots, snipers, machine gunners, tank crew members and partisans, as well as in auxiliary roles. Few of these women, however, were promoted to officers. \n\nFor Soviet women aviators, instrumental to this change was Marina Raskova, a famous Russian aviator. Raskova became a famous aviator as both a pilot and a navigator in the 1930s. She was the first woman to become a navigator in the Soviet Air Force in 1933. Raskova is credited with using her personal connections with Joseph Stalin to convince the military to form three combat regiments for women. The Soviet Union was the first nation to allow women pilots to fly combat missions. These regiments with strength of almost hundred airwomen, flew a combined total of more than 30,000 combat sorties, produced over twenty Heroes of the Soviet Union, and included two fighter aces. This military unit was initially called \"Aviation Group 122\" while the three regiments received training. After their training, the three regiments received their formal designations as the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment, and the 588th Night Bomber Regiment. Two of the units were honored with the Guards designation and renamed.\n\nThe Soviet Union also used women for sniping duties, and to good effect, including Nina Alexeyevna Lobkovskaya and Ukrainian Lyudmila Pavlichenko (who killed over 300 enemy soldiers). The Soviets found that sniper duties fit women well, since good snipers are patient, careful, deliberate, and should avoid tactical hand-to-hand combat. Women served also in non-combat roles as medics, nurses, communication personnel, political officers, as well - in small numbers - as machine gunners, tank drivers. Manshuk Mametova was a machine gunner from Kazakhstan and was the first Asian woman to receive the title Hero of the Soviet Union after she refused to retreat with the rest of her regiment.\n\nWomen constituted significant numbers of the Soviet partisans. One of the most famous was Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, who was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 16 February 1942. \n\nThe youngest woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union was also a resistance fighter, Zinaida Portnova.\n\nAfter the war, most women left the armed forces. Those that stayed to make a career in the post-war armed forces saw old attitudes return and promotion and opportunities more difficult. Also, some military academies closed their doors to women despite the supposed official policy of equality. In 1967, the Russian Universal Military Duty Laws concluded that women offered the greater source of available soldiers during periods of large scale mobilisation. Thus, several programs during the height of the Cold War were set up to encourage women to enlist. Participation in military orientated youth programs and forced participation in the reserves for ex-servicewomen up to the age of 40 are some examples. Universities contained reservist officer training which accompanied a place in the reserves themselves, especially for doctors. But some roles open to women during the war were later barred.\n\nWomen have had the legal right to serve in the Russian Armed Forces throughout the post Cold War period. In 2002, 10% of the Russian armed forces (100,000 of a total active strength of 988,100) were women.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7742229", "categories": ["Female aviators", "Soviet women in World War II", "Women in World War I", "Feminism in the Soviet Union", "Women in the Russian and Soviet military"], "title": "Women in the Russian and Soviet military"}

It consists of Ryan Maguire, better known by his stage name Kingston, and Ian Taggart, better known by his stage name Young God. They are known principally for their hip hop and instrumental music, made with a mixture of live instrumentation and sampling. Their name is \"a skydiving phrase alluding to beauty and death.\"\n\nKingston and Young God met and began collaborating on music in 2003. Young God, working under the name Rev. Left, began creating beats to rap over, but abandoned rapping and started producing exclusively around 2000. Kingston, working under the name Orphan, began his solo producing career collaborating with rapper Noah23 and the Plague Language collective (to which Young God also contributed production). Kingston entirely produced Noah23's debut album \"Cytoplasm Pixel\" in 1999, and the two collaborated closely until \"Jupiter Sajitarius\" in 2004, after which they parted ways. In the same year, Kingston worked on projects for Virtuoso's Omnipotent Records. He contributed a number of tracks to Jus Allah's scheduled Omnipotent debut \"All Fates Have Changed\", but the album was shelved. The tracks \"Vengeance\" and \"Drill Sergeant\" were later released on BSBD's \"Dirtnap\" mixtape, and a number of other beats recorded for the album were bootlegged on The Devil'z Rejects album \"Necronomicon\". One Kingston beat, \"Supreme (Black God's Remix)\" was included on the Babygrande Records release of \"All Fates Have Changed\" in 2005.\n\nThe duo, collaborating initially under the name Torso, signed their first record deal with Mush Records in 2005 to release the label's first double-disc album. During the album's production, the duo settled on their current name. The album, \"A Heap of Broken Images\", was released on June 23, 2006. The first disc featured twelve instrumental tracks with heavy live-instrumentation, while the second disc featured nine rap collaborations made with traditional hip hop sampling, and a closing instrumental. The guests included Rob Sonic, Mike Ladd, Jus Allah, Sabac Red, Wise Intelligent, A-Plus, Pep Love, Chief Kamachi, Myka 9, Virtuoso, Awol One and Holocaust. The album received acclaim from various sources, including Vapors, Word, Mean Street, UK Hip Hop and Allmusic, and landed the duo on URB's \"Next 100.\" Around the same time, the duo completed a collaborative project with Ceschi Ramos entitled \"Deadpan Darling\", which was never released due to the loss of most of the final mixes on a crashed hard drive.\n\nThe acclaim received for their debut album led to the duo landing a record deal with popular independent rap label Babygrande Records later in 2006. Their first release on the label was a full-length collaboration with Holocaust, titled \"\", released on September 5. Holocaust provided all the album's vocals with no guest appearances, and BSBD provided production for every track. The album included the duo's first 12-inch single \"The Ocean / No Image\". The duo's next album was a collaboration with another Wu-Tang affiliate, Sunz of Man and Black Market Militia member Hell Razah. Their album \"Razah's Ladder\" was released on October 23, 2007. Unlike \"The Holocaust\", the album included outside guest appearances, featuring Crooked I, Shabazz the Disciple, Ill Bill, Sabac Red and Prodigal Sunn. The duo strayed from the dark soundscapes featured on \"The Holocaust\", instead providing a soulful backdrop for Razah. Shortly before the release of \"Razah's Ladder\", the duo released their first mixtape, titled \"Dirtnap\", featuring various unreleased collaborations and two instrumentals from their forthcoming album.\n\nThe duo's next release was their first all-instrumental project, \"Late Night Cinema\", released on April 29, 2008. The dense instrumentals featured contributions from violinists, organists, trumpeters, synth players and vocalists, as well as guitar, keyboard and drum kit work from the producers themselves. The album received high acclaim from XLR8R, Music-Reviewer, PopMatters, SputnikMusic and RapReviews.com. RapReviews writer Pedro Hernandez stated \"With this album, Blue Sky Black Death pushes the limits of what hip-hop music can be\" and called it \"essential listening\". BSBD stayed active online throughout 2008, releasing two instrumental podcast blends titled \"Gifts in Jail Vol. 1\" and \"Gifts in Jail Vol. 2\", as well as a screwed version of \"Late Night Cinema\" titled \"Lean Night Cinema\".\n\nIn June 2008, after an online petition from fans, Babygrande released the acclaimed instrumentals from \"The Holocaust\" on vinyl and CD. BSBD then contributed twelve of thirteen tracks for Phoenix MC Gutta's debut album \"Heads Will Roll\", released on Babygrande on September 2. On September 30, Babygrande released the album \"The Evil Jeanius\", by pairing Jean Grae vocals with Blue Sky Black Death beats. November saw the duo's fifth release of the year, \"Slow Burning Lights\", an indie pop project with singer Yes Alexander), which was recorded and completed two years before its release.\n\n\"Third Party\", a collaboration with Alexander Chen of Boy in Static, was released on Fake Four Inc in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Blue Sky Black Death released a new album, \"Noir\", on Fake Four Inc. The duo also released \"For the Glory\", a collaborative album with rapper Nacho Picasso, in the same year.\n\nTwo more collaborative albums with Nacho Picasso, \"Lord of the Fly\" and \"Exalted\", were released in 2012.\n\nA follow up album with Yes Alexander entitled \"World Wide Romance\" was scheduled to be released sometime in 2013. The first single from the album \"Heart Attack\" was released in 2010.\n\nIn May 2013, BSBD released a single titled \"Valley of Kings\" which features Cam'ron, SAS and N.O.R.E. This was followed by the release of their new instrumental album \"Glaciers\" on October 1, 2013.\n\nOn February 14, 2014, Blue Sky Black Death released an unofficial remix of Frank Ocean's 2012 single \"Pyramids\", which included a chopped and screwed sample of Pimp C's verse from UGK's 1999 single \"Wood Wheel\".\n\nIn January 2014, the duo returned to their roots and looked to truly realize ideas which were previously seen in their earlier works. BSBD also had camoes from other Fake Four Inc. signers, Child Actor and JMSN, in their album Glaciers.\n\nIn December 2017 Blue Sky Black Death made a post on their official Twitter saying simply they were \"resting eternally\". In comment, Young God of Blue Sky Black Death replied the group hadn't been working on a project for some time but they were still in contact.\n\nBlue Sky Black Death\n\nNacho Picasso & Blue Sky Black Death\n\nOther collaborations\n\n", "id": "7742278", "categories": ["Musical groups established in 2003", "American hip hop record producers", "Alternative hip hop musicians", "West Coast hip hop groups", "Musical groups from San Francisco", "Hip hop duos", "Trip hop groups", "American musical duos", "Record production teams"], "title": "Blue Sky Black Death"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742303", "text": "Ballylaneen\n\nBallylaneen ( previously spelt as Baile Uí Laithín) is a small village in County Waterford, Ireland, approximately halfway between the villages of Kilmacthomas and Bunmahon on a hill by the River Mahon.\n\nThe village features a Catholic church (St. Anne's, built in 1824), a public house, a now closed shop-garage and about seven dwelling houses. It also has St. Anne's Holy Well, where people are said to have gone to pray for cures in the past (enclosed by a wall in 1974). The village was larger in the 19th century and gave its name to a parish of its own, which was administered from Mothel. Today Ballylaneen is part of Stradbally parish. The ruins of a large mill can be seen on the river Mahon, east of the village. This was one of five mills, which were sited on the river Mahon. The other four were at Mahonbridge (one) and Kilmacthomas (three). The present village is actually situated in the townland of Carrigcastle, while the old school and old graveyard are located in the townland of Ballylaneen.\n\nThere are two graveyards associated with the village. The newer of the two, adjacent to St Anne's church has one grave of interest: a flat horizontal tombstone commemorating Mark Anthony of Carrigcastle (1786 – 1 June 1867) who was an officer in the British Royal Navy and served in the battle of Trafalgar. The old graveyard (rarely used nowadays) is outside the present village on the Kilmacthomas road. It is the burial place of the poet Tadhg Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin (see below). Half a mile to the west of the village is an ancient stone-walled circular enclosure called Cathair Breac on a hill overlooking the village. On another hill south-west of the village in Carrigcastle, there is a subterranean neolithic corbel-roofed chamber, which was unearthed in the early 1970s.\n\nThe village had its own primary school, originally established under the British National School system. It was closed down in the 1950s, after which most of the pupils from the area attended Seafield near Bunmahon. The old school building is still standing adjacent to the old graveyard, and was recently refurbished as a holiday home. \n\nThe best-known teacher at the National School was the Gaelic scholar Tom Walsh (Tomas Breathnach) around 1910. While he taught there, promising children from other school catchment areas attended, including John Kiely of Stradbally (later FRCSI) and David Hill of Kilmacthomas (later MPSI). Tom Walsh translated the Latin inscription (composed by Donncha Rua mac Conmara) to Gaelic on the tomb-stone of Tadhg Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin. \n\nWalsh was succeeded by Tom Cashin NT who taught in Ballylaneen until the school's closure who features in accounts of the disappearance of Larry Griffin, the missing postman from Kilmacthomas (1929)).\n\nThe name Ballylaneen appears in a book title “The Road From Ballylaneen to Skellig Michael” by English writer Michael White, being randomly chosen for its good phonetic sound and its location near the south coast.\n\nThe old graveyard in Ballylaneen is the burial place of the famous Munster poet and religious writer Tadhg Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin. His tombstone is a flat upright monument with a curved top and a Latin inscription on the front. It's located a few metres from the gable end of the old National School building. The Latin epitaph was composed by the poet Donncha Rua mac Conmara (buried in Newtown, 4 miles away), who was a friend of his. The Irish translation on the black plastic plaque (shown right) was done by Tom Walsh (Tomas Breatnac), the teacher in the old National School in the early 1900s. Tadhg Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin (Timothy O'Sullivan) was born in Tuar na Fola (Tournafulla), Co. Limerick around 1715. He moved first to Cork, where he lived for about 30 years, and later to Co. Waterford and died in Waterford city in 1795. His writings include Timothy O'Sullivan's Pious Miscellany published in English in 1802 in Clonmel (his work was originally written and published in Irish while he was alive). His works were published again in Gaelic in 1868 by John O'Daly Publishers, 9 Anglesea St., Dublin (see reprint at https://archive.org/stream/piousmiscellanyo00suoft#page/n3/mode/2up), and there is considerable information in the preface written O'Daly, although O'Daly's account of Tadhg Gaelach's dates and birthplace are now agreed to be incorrect. Up to the time of his death, Tadhg Gaelach was admired and possibly sometimes looked after by a relatively prosperous local catholic farming family, the O'Callaghans. He was also a frequent guest of Ballylaneen Parish Priest, Rev Richard Morrissey, who is most likely to be responsible for Tadhg's being buried here. Other patrons of his included an O'Phelan (Faoláin) family of the Decies, and one of his songs is written in their honour (“Do Seoirse agus Domhnall Ó Faoiláin” to be sung to the air of “Bonny Jane”, see https://archive.org/stream/piousmiscellanyo00suoft#page/82/mode/2up). Tadhg Gaelach's hymns were published by an tAthair Pádraig Ua Duinnínin in Dublin in 1903.\n\n", "id": "7742303", "categories": [], "title": "Ballylaneen"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742322", "text": "Agriculture in Kyrgyzstan\n\nAgriculture in Kyrgyzstan is a significant sector of the economy. According to the CIA World Factbook, it comprises 18% of the total GDP and occupies 48% of the total labor force. Only 6.8% of the total land area is used for crop cultivation, but 44% of the land is used as pastures for livestock. Because of the many mountains of Kyrgyzstan, animal husbandry remains a significant part of the agricultural economy.\n\nCultivation is centered in the Ferghana Valley, Talas Province, and Chuy Province.\n\nAmong Kyrgyzstan's agricultural products are tobacco, cotton, potatoes, vegetables, grapes, fruits, and berries. As far as total production, the largest crop is assorted types of animal fodder to feed the livestock of the country. The second largest crop is winter wheat, followed by barley, corn, and rice.\n\nSignificant animal derived products include sheep, goats, cattle, and wool. Chickens, horses, and pigs are also present. In some regions, yaks are herded and bred.\n\nOf these, the top products for export are cotton and tobacco. Meat is also exported, but in less significant quantities. However, the country has over 9 million hectares of pasture and a favourable environment for the development of animal husbandry. Recently Kyrgyzstan concluded accords to export meat to Saudi Arabia from September, 2012.\n\nIn 2010, AOI-Kyrgyzstan, a Kyrgyz subsidiary of Alliance One International Inc., a global tobacco leaf merchant headquartered in North Carolina, United States, pleaded guilty to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), relating to bribes paid to Kyrgyzstan government officials in connection with its purchase of Kyrgyz tobacco.\n\nAlliance One was formed from a merger between Dimon Incorporated and Standard Commercial Corporation in 2005. AOI-Kyrgyzstan admitted that employees of Dimon’s Kyrgyz subsidiary paid a total of approximately US$3 million in bribes from 1996 to 2004 to various officials in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, including officials of the Kyrgyz Tamekisi, a government entity that controlled and regulated the tobacco industry in Kyrgyzstan. Bribes totalling US$254,262 were made to five local provincial government officials, known as \"Akims\", to obtain permission to purchase tobacco from local growers during the same period.\n\nThere was also significant incidence of child labor in the tobacco industry. In fact, the 2013 U.S. Department of Labor report on the worst forms of child labor indicated that 4.5% of children aged 5 to 14 were engaged in such working conditions in tobacco cultivation, and that despite the availability of education, evidence suggested that \"a limited number of schools required children to harvest tobacco on school grounds\". Despite adopting an action plan for the National Program against Human Trafficking for 2013-2016, \"interagency coordination on child labor continued to be poor\", according to the report. More recently in December 2014, the Department's \"List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor\" reported tobacco as a good still produced by Kyrgyz children, among others. To tobacco, the list added cotton, the cultivation of which was determined by national law as hazardous.\n\nThe organic movement began in Kyrgyzstan in 2004. At that time, 34 pioneer farmers were engaged in it. Today, Bio Farmer unites more than a thousand certified farmers and offers organic products such as cotton, sunflower seeds, beans, medical and aromatic plants, and dried apricots. According to experts, organic farming is most suitable to countries with generally small farms, cheap labor and a shortage of capital. Thus, organic farming may become Kyrgyzstan’s perfect future. In fact, the Kyrgyzstan Parliament just announced a plan to phase out all non-organic farming and switch to 100% organic agriculture by 2028.\n\n\n", "id": "7742322", "categories": [], "title": "Agriculture in Kyrgyzstan"}

Found in woodland, it is a trailing or twining vine with leaves with several small 'teeth' on the margins and bright yellow flowers in early spring. It adapts readily to cultivation and can be grown as a pot plant. The species was first described in 1817.\n\n\"Hibbertia dentata\" was first formally described in 1817 in \"Regni Vegetabilis Systema Naturale\" of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle by the prolific botanist Robert Brown. The species name is the Latin adjective \"dentata\" \"toothed\", referring to the toothed leaf margins. George Bentham classified it in the series Hemihibbertiae based on flower anatomy, defining members of the group having glabrous carpels and numerous stamens.\n\n\"Hibbertia dentata\" grows as a twining vine, the stems of which can be up to in length, and trail over rocks and other shrubs. The dark green leaves are ovate, measuring long by wide., and sit on 1 cm long petioles. The apex of the leaf blade can be pointed or blunt, while the leaf margins are toothed. They can be purple-tinged and covered in fur when young and smooth upon reaching maturity. The flowers appear mainly from July to November. They arise from axillary buds or on the ends of short stems. They have five petals that are long each, and over 30 stamens. The flowers generally wither within a day or two. The fruit is mature over November to January, splitting to release the seeds.\n\n\"Hibbertia dentata\" occurs in open forest or on the edge of rainforest along the east coast and hinterlands of New South Wales, extending into southeastern Queensland and eastern Victoria. Associated forest species in the Sydney region include mountain grey gum (\"Eucalyptus cypellocarpa\"), Sydney peppermint (\"E. piperita\"), messmate (\"E. obliqua\"), Sydney red gum (\"Angophora costata\"), turpentine (\"Syncarpia glomulifera\") and scrub species such as coastal tea tree (\"Leptospermum laevigatum\"). Within this habitat it is found on sheltered slopes in areas with good drainage, on clay-, shale- or sandstone-based soils that are high in nutrients.\n\n\"Hibbertia dentata\" can resprout after bushfire from its roots and flower within ten months. Seedlings have also been recorded in this time frame.\n\nThe flowers are visited by European honeybees, native short-tongue bees of the families Halictidae and Colletidae, and large hoverflies of the genus \"Melangyna\".\n\nAlthough not often seen in cultivation, \"Hibbertia dentata\" is an easy plant to grow in the garden and more shade-tolerant than the widely cultivated \"H. scandens\". Though fair drainage is required, the plant suffers if allowed to dry out and hence needs to be kept moist. It grows well as a pot plant. It was brought into cultivation in England in 1814. In 1817, it was described in the Loddiges periodical \"The Botanical Cabinet\" as being \"a fine subject for planting out in a conservatory,\".\n\nPropagation is relatively easy by cuttings of mature material, and seedlings may spontaneously arise in gardens where it is established.\n", "id": "7742341", "categories": ["Flora of New South Wales", "Flora of Queensland", "Hibbertia"], "title": "Hibbertia dentata"}

On 19 November 2009 Van Rompuy was selected by the members of the European Council, which is the institution of the European Union (EU) comprising the heads of state or government of the EU member states, as the first full-time President of that Council under the Treaty of Lisbon. He was appointed for the period from 1 December 2009 until 31 May 2012, though he only took up his position officially on 1 January 2010. On 1 March 2012 he was re-elected for a second (and last) term, to last from 1 June 2012 until 30 November 2014.\n\nBorn in Etterbeek, Brussels, to Dr., later Professor of Economics, Victor Lodewijk Maurits \"Vic\" van Rompuy (Begijnendijk, 27 February 1923 – Begijnendijk, 14 November 2004) and wife Germaine Geens (Begijnendijk, 1 December 1921 – Begijnendijk, 23 November 2004), he attended Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege in Brussels (until 1965), where Ancient Greek and Latin were his main subjects. During his early teens, he was an avid rock and roll fan, especially of US singer Elvis Presley. Later he studied at the and received a bachelor's degree in Philosophy (1968) and a master's degree in Applied Economics (1971). He worked at the Belgian Central Bank from 1972 to 1975.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1987 he was a Lecturer at the Handelshogeschool Antwerpen (now Lessius University College); from 1982 he was also a lecturer at the Vlaamse Economische Hogeschool Brussel (VLEKHO now Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel).\n\nVan Rompuy is married to Geertrui Windels, with whom he has four children: Peter (born 1980), Laura (born 1981), Elke (born 1983) and Thomas (born 1986). His eldest son, Peter, is active in the Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V) party and stood as a candidate in the Belgian regional elections of 2009.\n\nHis younger brother, Eric Van Rompuy, is also a politician in the CD&V and was a minister in the Flemish Government from 1995 to 1999. His sister, Tine Van Rompuy, is a member of the Workers Party of Belgium. He has another sister, Anita Van Rompuy, who is not politically active, married to Arne van der Graesen.\n\nVan Rompuy was the chairman of the national Christian People's Party's (CVP) youth council (1973–1977). From 1975 to 1980 he worked in the ministerial cabinets of Leo Tindemans and Gaston Geens. In 1978 he was elected a member of the national CVP's bureau (1978–present). He first was elected to the Belgian Senate in 1988 and served until 1995. In 1988 he shortly served as Secretary of State for Finance and for Small and Medium Enterprises before becoming the national chairman of the CVP (1988–1993).\n\nVan Rompuy was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Budget from September 1993 to July 1999 in the two governments led by Jean-Luc Dehaene. As budget minister, together with finance minister Philippe Maystadt, he helped drive down Belgium's debt from a peak of 135% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1993. It fell to below 100% of GDP in 2003.\n\nHe was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in the 1995 general election, but as he remained a minister, he was barred from taking the seat while holding that office. After his party's defeat in the 1999 Belgian general election, he became a member of the Chamber of Representatives. He was re-elected in 2003 and 2007. In 2004, he was designated Minister of State.\n\nBefore he was President, Van Rompuy expressed reticence about possible Turkish membership of the EU. In 2004, he stated \"An enlargement [of the EU] with Turkey is not in any way comparable with previous enlargement waves. Turkey is not Europe and will never be Europe.\" He continued \"But it's a matter of fact that the universal values which are in force in Europe, and which are also the fundamental values of Christianity, will lose vigour with the entry of a large Islamic country such as Turkey.\"\n\nAs President, Van Rompuy has avoided opposing Turkish membership. On 23 December 2010, he said \"Turkish reform efforts have delivered impressive results.\" He continued \"Turkey plays an ever more active role in its neighbourhood. Turkey is also a full-standing member of the G-20, just like five EU countries and the EU itself. In my view, even before an outcome of the negotiations, the European Union should develop a close partnership with the Turkish Republic.\"\n\nAfter eight years in opposition, CD&V (formerly known as CVP) returned to government. On 12 July 2007, was elected as the President of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, succeeding Herman De Croo.\n\nOn 28 December 2008, following the 2007–2008 Belgian political crisis, Van Rompuy was asked by King Albert II to form a new government after he was reluctant to take up the role of Prime Minister. He was sworn in as Belgian prime minister on 30 December 2008.\n\nOn 13 October 2009 Bloomberg reported that the government of Herman Van Rompuy would seek to tax banks and nuclear power to tame the deficit.\n\n\"We are in the early stages of a recovery and at this time it is important not to weaken burgeoning confidence and to lay the foundations of a sustainable recovery\" Van Rompuy said in a speech to parliament in Brussels. \"Most important is to keep the direction. That will also provide stability and support.\"\n\nOn 13 October Bloomberg reported the following about Government Debt Policy: \"Belgium will trim its budget deficit to 5.3% of gross domestic product in 2011 from almost 5.7% both this year and next, according to a slide presentation handed out by State Secretary for the Budget . told Parliament earlier today that the deficit would widen to 5.4% of GDP this year. Belgium's deficit will be little changed next year as the shortfall at the level of regional governments and municipalities will widen to 1.5% of GDP from 0.7%, offsetting efforts by the federal government to trim its deficit. Government debt will start exceeding one year's worth of national output , according to European Commission forecasts. Belgium had trimmed debt to as little as 84% of GDP in 2007, before bailouts of Fortis, Dexia SA, KBC Group NV and mutual insurer Ethias Group increased the nation's borrowing costs and inflated the debt ratio to 89.6% at the end of last year.\"\n\nOn 22 October 2009 Reuters reported that the government had signed a commitment with GDF Suez for nuclear power fees to Belgium. The outstanding dispute with GDF concerns the €250 million fee that Belgium is attempting to charge GDF for 2009 as part of its \"Renewable Energy Fund\" as stated in the article: \"Belgium has also charged nuclear producers a total of 250 million euros for 2008 and the same for 2009, as well as 250 million euros this year payable to a renewable energy fund. These fees remain in dispute. The producers are challenging the 2008 payment in Belgium's constitutional court. A spokesman for said the government would pass a law to enforce the 500 million euro charge for this year, adding that this could also be contested by GDF Suez.\"\n\nOn 19 November 2009, Van Rompuy was chosen unanimously by the European Council, at an informal meeting in Brussels, to be the first full-time President of the European Council; for the period of 1 December 2009 (the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon) until 31 May 2012. He took up his position officially on 1 January 2010.\n\nGordon Brown also praised Van Rompuy as \"a consensus-builder\" who had \"brought a period of political stability to his country after months of uncertainty\". This opinion is shared by others; he has been described as the painstaking builder of impossible compromises (\"l'horloger des compromis impossibles\") A statement made by Van Rompuy at a news conference after his selection illustrates his approach: \n\nBeing pro-europe, not all parties and fractions had positive words for Van Rompuy when he took office. Nigel Farage attacked the freshly appointed president by saying : \"you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low grade bank clerk\". He was fined 3000 Euros (ten days pay) for this by the Bureau of the European Parliament. These comments were a manifestation of the frustration of lack of democratic process in the appointment of Van Rompuy to presidency.\n\nIn a November 2009 press conference, Van Rompuy related to global governance by stating: \"2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of a financial crisis; the climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet.\" Van Rompuy referred to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009.\n\nIn or just before the first months of his presidency Van Rompuy visited all EU member states, he also organised an informal meeting of the heads of state of the EU. The meeting took place on 11 February 2010 in the Solvay Library (Brussels), topics to be discussed were the future direction of the economic policies of the EU, the outcome of the Copenhagen Conference and the then recent earthquake in Haiti.\n\nIn fact, the meeting was in part taken over by the growing sovereign debt crisis (at that time, Greece), which was to become the hall mark of Van Rompuy's first two years as President. With EU member states holding divergent positions on this issue, he had to find compromises, not least between France and Germany, at subsequent European Council meetings and summits of Eurozone heads of state or government leading to the establishment of the three-year European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM)and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) in May 2010 to provide loans to Greece (and later Ireland and Portugal) to help stabilise their borrowing costs, but subject to strict conditions.\nThe European Council also gave him the assignment of chairing a task force on economic governance, composed of personal representatives (mostly ministers of finance) of the heads of government, which reported ahead of schedule to the October 2010 European Council. Its report, which proposed stronger macro-economic co-ordination within the EU in general and the Eurozone in particular and also a tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact was endorsed by the European Council. The latter also charged him with preparing, by December 2010, a proposal for a limited change to the Treaty required to enable a more permanent financial stability mechanism. His draft – for an addition to Article 136 TFEU, pertaining to the Eurozone – was endorsed by the European Council at its October 2010 meeting.\nHis second year in office, 2011, was also marked by a deterioration of the Greek debt crisis, leading to Van Rompuy calling an extraordinary meeting of the Eurozone heads of state or government in July to adopt a first package of further measures (notably longer term loans at lower interest rates, private sector debt-writedown, further fiscal consolidation in Greece) and again in October (in conjunction with full European Council meetings) to contain contagion from Greece to other countries (through bank recapitalisation across Europe and by leveraging the firepower of the EFSF to about €1 trillion).\n\nHis first two years were also marked by his role in co-ordinating European positions on the world stage at G8 and G20 summits and bilateral summits, such as the tense 5 October 2010 EU-China summit. He called a special European Council at short notice in early 2011 on the emerging Libya crisis, which, in agreeing conditions for military intervention, made it impossible for Germany to oppose such intervention once the conditions were fulfilled.\n\nOn 1 March 2012 Herman Van Rompuy was re-elected unanimously as President of the European Council by the heads of state or government of the 28 EU member states. President Van Rompuy's second term has lasted for two and a half years, from 1 June 2012 to 30 November 2014. After this second mandate he could not have been re-elected because the European Council President's term of office can only be extended once.\n\nHerman Van Rompuy was also appointed as the first President of the Euro Summit, and this for the same term of office as his Presidency of the European Council. The Euro Summit meetings are to take place at least twice a year.\n\nIn 2014, Van Rompuy was awarded the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen for his EU role.\n\nWhen the EPP membership of Hungarian party Fidesz was suspended in 2019, EPP president Joseph Daul appointed van Rompuy – alongside Hans-Gert Pöttering and Wolfgang Schüssel – to a group of high-level experts who were mandated to monitor Fidesz’s compliance with EPP values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the European Council is, under the terms of the Lisbon treaty, a separate institution of the EU, it does not have its own administration. The administrative support for both the European Council and its president is provided by the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union.\n\nThe president does have, however, his own private office (\"cabinet\") of close advisers. Van Rompuy chose as his chief of staff (\"chef de cabinet\") Baron Frans van Daele, formerly Belgian ambassador to, variously, the USA, the UN, the EU and NATO and chief of staff of several Belgian foreign ministers. Also in his team are the former UK Labour MEP Richard Corbett, former Hungarian Ambassador to NATO Zoltan Martinusz, former head of the EU's economic & financial committee Odile Renaud-Basso, Luuk van Middelaar, his main speech writer, and Van Rompuy's long standing press officer Dirk De Backer.\n\nIn 2013 Frans Van Daele retired both as a diplomat and as chief of Staff of Van Rompuy, and was appointed chief of staff to king Philippe. He was succeeded as chief of staff of Herman Van Rompuy by Didier Seeuws.\n\n\nAlongside with José Manuel Barroso\n", "id": "7742342", "categories": ["Belgian Ministers of State", "European People's Party politicians", "1947 births", "Belgian economists", "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven alumni", "People from Etterbeek", "Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams politicians", "Flemish politicians", "Grand Officiers of the Légion d'honneur", "People from Brussels", "Presidents of the European Council", "Members of the Belgian Federal Parliament", "Belgian Roman Catholics", "Living people", "Presidents of the Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)", "Knights Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau", "Ministers of Agriculture of Belgium", "Grand Cordons of the Order of the Rising Sun", "Counts of Belgium"], "title": "Herman Van Rompuy"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742395", "text": "Thomas Madiou\n\nThomas Madiou (30 April 1814 – 1884) was a Haitian historian. His work \"Histoire d'Haïti\" (English: \"History of Haiti\") is the first complete history of Haiti from 1492 to 1846 (Madiou's present). It is considered one of the most valuable documents of Haitian history and literature.\n\nBorn in Port-au-Prince to \"fairly affluent parents\", Madiou left Haiti at the age ten to study in France at the Royal College of Angers (\"Collège Royal d'Angers\"). He later studied in Rennes, France and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Letters there. He then attended the Law School of Paris for two years before returning to Haiti. During his time in France, Madiou met Isaac Louverture, the son of Haiti's revolutionary hero Toussaint Louverture. This encounter supposedly sparked Madiou's interest in his country's past, and he returned to Haiti with the intention to write its history. Over a decade later, Madiou published three volumes covering Haiti's history from 1492 to 1807 with the Port-au-Prince publisher J. Courtois. A fourth volume (1843–46) appeared as part of Haiti's centennial in 1904. 150 years after the text's initial printing, the Haitian publishing house, Henri Deschamps, published the complete history, eight volumes spanning 1492 to 1846.\n\nIn \"Histoire d'Haïti,\" Madiou continued the work of earlier Haitian authors to combat racialized portrayals of Haiti's past, in particular the country's founding. He saw himself filling a crucial void by writing the first complete national history by a Haitian author. The history was valuable not only for Haitians but all members of the African Diaspora. To construct, his multi-volume history, Madiou relied heavily upon French written sources; however, he also recognized the importance of oral histories as a supplement to the written archive. He interviewed aging revolutionary veterans during his travels across the country with General Joseph Balthazar Inginac, the secretary-general for Haiti's longest serving nineteenth-century president, Jean-Pierre Boyer. His history tried to repair the reputation of the black leaders of the Haitian Revolution, especially Toussaint Louverture, portraying the struggle as a justified rebellion against the terrible oppression of slavery. This placed his work in contrast to the history written by Beaubrun Ardouin, appearing a few years after Madiou's, which tried to place the Haitian Revolution in the context of the other independence struggles in Latin America and deny it a class or racial character. Ardouin was trying to make Haiti fit into the community of nations in the Americas in the 1830s while Madiou was stressing what made Haiti unique.\n\nIn addition to his writing, Madiou served in various government positions, including director of the national high school and minister plenipotentiary to Spain. He also worked as Director of \"Le Moniteur\", the official government publication, and was a contributor to Haiti's small but vibrant press.\n\n\n", "id": "7742395", "categories": ["1884 deaths", "1814 births", "19th-century historians", "Haitian male writers", "Haitian historians", "People from Port-au-Prince"], "title": "Thomas Madiou"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742396", "text": "John Le Hay\n\nJohn Le Hay was the stage name of John Mackway Healy (25 March 1854 – 2 November 1926), an English singer and actor known for his portrayal of the comic baritone roles in the Savoy Operas. He also appeared in non-musical plays, adaptations of French comic operas and opérettes, and in Edwardian musical comedy, usually in comic roles, though sometimes in more serious character parts. As a skilled ventriloquist he appeared before royalty, and periodically he presented his own one-man entertainment during his half-century long stage career.\n\nLe Hay was born in Bethnal Green, London, although later he would say that he had been born in Ireland. His parents were John Healy (1820–1901) and his wife Sophia Elizabeth Mackway (1823– 1886), both Londoners. He had a younger brother, Joseph (1858–1931). His father worked as a manager in a pawnshop, where Le Hay began his working life.\n\nAs a young actor he made his first stage appearance at the King's Cross Theatre in London and then travelled with a minstrel troupe, where he developed his gift for ventriloquism. He was engaged in 1879 at the Royalty Theatre, London, where he worked as an understudy and appeared in the chorus of a revival of Stephenson and Sullivan's \"The Zoo\". Later that year he joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, serving in the chorus on tour. In July 1879, he survived a boating accident on the River Avon at Bathampton in which two other members of the touring company drowned. He appeared in the single copyright performance of \"The Pirates of Penzance\" in Paignton on 30 December 1879, as James, a role that was included in the libretto only for that performance. During 1880 and 1881, he continued in the chorus and also appeared as Mr. Liverby in \"In the Sulks\", and Benjamin Walker in \"Four by Honours\", curtain-raisers that accompanied \"H.M.S. Pinafore\".\n\nLe Hay married Marian Lowry (1854–1940), also a member of the D'Oyly Carte company, who performed under the stage name of Marian May for about a decade. The couple had three daughters and a son; two of these, Norah Sophia (1884–1970) and Millicent Marian Rylance (1888–1966), became actresses. From 1881 to 1883, Le Hay served as the principal comedian with a D'Oyly Carte touring company, playing J. W. Wells in \"The Sorcerer\", Sir Joseph Porter in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", and Major General Stanley in \"Pirates\". He also appeared briefly in the tenor role of Ralph Rackstraw in \"Pinafore\" and filled in as Frederic in \"Pirates\" on one occasion. \"The Western Mail\" praised his performance in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\":\nLe Hay left the D'Oyly Carte company in 1884; he toured as Dick in \"Vice-Versa\" and Coombes in the Victorian burlesque \"Silver Guilt\". and played in pantomime, in low comedies with Cooper Cole's Strand Company, and, for a year, was a member of the company headed by Edward Terry at the Gaiety Theatre in London. In 1886 he created the part of Tom Strutt in Alfred Cellier's comic opera \"Dorothy\", and played it throughout its run of 931 performances, which ended on 6 April 1889. A fortnight later he created the role of Crook in Cellier's next opera, \"Doris\". Over the following years, among other roles, he created or played leading roles in various other West End musicals and operettas: Private Smith in \"The Red Hussar\" (1889) Jacob in \"The Black Rover\" (1890), a revival of the comic opera \"Les cloches de Corneville\" alongside Leonora Braham (1890), and Prince Bulbo in Augustus Harris's production of a musical adaptation of \"The Rose and the Ring\" (1890–1891).\n\nIn 1891 Le Hay played Sir Guy of Gisborne in \"Maid Marian\" by Harry B. Smith and Reginald De Koven, after which he rejoined D'Oyly Carte for a year. Initially he was a member of a touring company, playing Punka, Rajah of Chutneypore, in \"The Nautch Girl\". In November Richard D'Oyly Carte brought him to London to play Master Guillot in the British premiere of Messager's \"The Basoche\" at the Royal English Opera House; \"The Era\" judged it his best performance to date. When \"The Basoche\" closed in early 1892 Le Hay rejoined the \"Nautch Girl\" company, playing Punka for the remainder of the tour.\n\nLater in 1892 Le Hay played Sacrovir in \"The Wedding Eve\", an adaptation of an opérette by Frédéric Toulmouche, with Decima Moore as its leading lady, after which he recreated his original role of Tom Strutt in a revival of \"Dorothy\". In 1893 he was in \"The Black Domino\", a melodrama starring Mrs. Patrick Campbell, in which Le Hay played a character role, and Arthur Williams provided the principal comic relief. The piece was preceded by a curtain-raiser, billed as an \"Entertainment\", given by Le Hay. He rejoined D'Oyly Carte for the last time in late 1893, creating the part of Phantis in \"Utopia, Limited\" at the Savoy Theatre, and playing it until the end of the run in June 1894.\n\nLater in 1894 Le Hay appeared with Lillian Russell in \"The Queen of Brilliants\", and then as Mats Munck in Gilbert and Carr's comic opera \"His Excellency\". He later played the same part in New York, with a George Edwardes touring company. In 1896, he played Alexander McGregor in the musical comedy \"My Girl\", an Edwardes production written by James T. Tanner, Carr and Adrian Ross, in a West End cast that also included Ellaline Terriss, Willie Warde and Connie Ediss. In September 1897 Le Hay starred with Florence St. John in a new production of Offenbach's \"La Périchole\" at the Garrick Theatre. Both performers received excellent notices: \"The Era\" described her performance as \"a complete triumph\", and his as \"inimitable\"; the critic in \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" wrote, \"Mr John Le Hay as the Viceroy was simply admirable. Not only have we not seen this part better rendered, but we can hardly imagine it so. … pure comedy\".\n\nLe Hay appeared in New York as Hassan in Hood and Sullivan's \"The Rose of Persia\" (1900, opposite Ruth Vincent as the Sultana), and as Coquenard in the American premiere of Messager's \"Véronique\" (1905). He toured America three times and South Africa once. His talents as a ventriloquist were in demand, and he appeared in that capacity on several occasions before King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace and Sandringham. From time to time Le Hay appeared solo or with his own small company in sketches at music halls. One of his later theatrical parts was in Thomas Hardy's \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\" in 1925, with Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies in the title role. The reviewer in \"Punch\" wrote, \"Mr John Le Hay gave us a superb little study of an old countryman which richly deserved the enthusiastic applause that rewarded it\".\n\nOn 1 November 1926 Le Hay was struck by a car on his way home from the Lyceum Theatre in London, where he had been appearing as Florent, the butler, in \"The Padre\". He died the next day at the age of 77. He was survived by his wife, Marian May, a former D'Oyly Carte performer.\n\n\n", "id": "7742396", "categories": ["Gilbert and Sullivan performers", "1854 births", "19th-century English singers", "English male singers", "1926 deaths", "English male stage actors"], "title": "John Le Hay"}

California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to refuse counsel and represent themselves in state criminal proceedings.\n\nThe defendant Anthony Faretta was accused of grand theft in Los Angeles County, California. Well before the trial began, the defendant requested permission to represent himself. Questioning by the judge revealed that he had once represented himself in a criminal case and that he believed that the public defender's office was under a heavy case load. The judge warned him that he was making a mistake and emphasized that he would receive no special treatment. The judge entered a preliminary ruling allowing Faretta to represent himself, however stating that he might reverse his decision if it seemed that he was unable to adequately represent himself.\n\nSeveral weeks later, but still before the trial, the judge initiated a hearing to inquire into Faretta's ability to defend himself. After questioning him on numerous topics, including hearsay and juries, the judge ruled that his answers were inadequate and he had not made an intelligent decision to waive counsel. In addition he ruled that Faretta had no constitutional right to his own defense. Therefore he rescinded his previous decision. During the trial the judge denied Faretta's motions to be co-counsel and other motions he attempted to make on his behalf. Subsequently he was convicted by a jury and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nThe California Court of Appeal, which relied on a recent California Supreme Court decision that had expressly decided the issue, ruled that Faretta had no federal or state right to represent himself. Appeal to the Supreme Court of California was denied.\n\nIn the opinion of the court by Justice Stewart, the Court held that a defendant in a state criminal trial has the constitutional right to refuse appointed counsel and conduct the trial when he or she voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so. However, such a defendant may not later complain that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court brought analogies to the Star Chamber, saying \"the Star Chamber has, for centuries, symbolized disregard of basic individual rights. The Star Chamber not merely allowed, but required, defendants to have counsel. The defendant's answer to an indictment was not accepted unless it was signed by counsel. When counsel refused to sign the answer, for whatever reason, the defendant was considered to have confessed.\"\n\nJustice Blackmun wrote a dissent where he questioned the additional procedural problems that would inevitably arise by the decision, arguing that such procedural problems would far outweigh whatever tactical advantage the defendant may feel he has gained by electing to represent himself. Blackmun concludes with the following: \"If there is any truth to the old proverb 'one who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client,' the Court by its opinion today now bestows a \"constitutional\" right on one to make a fool of himself.\"\n\n", "id": "7742402", "categories": ["Self-representation case law", "United States Supreme Court cases", "Legal history of California", "1975 in California", "United States Sixth Amendment self-representation case law", "1975 in United States case law"], "title": "Faretta v.

He was born in the early 1850s, and was the elder son of Joy Sankar Choudhuri of Teota. Teota zamindars were one of the well-known zamindars of Bengal. Their ancestral surname was Dasgupta (Dash-sharma).\n\nParbati Sankar was an active member of the British Indian Association, the Indian Association, the Indian National Congress, and the Dacca district board. He was also one of the founders of the Indian Industrial Association, which was set up to promote the material and economic development of the region. As part of the economic reconstruction programme, Parbati Sankar attempted to make use of the material raw resources available within the Teota zamindari (in Goalondo, Faridpur and elsewhere). His name is also associated with the formulation of a concrete and detailed plan (1890s) of extension of the railways to Manikganj, linking it up with the town of Dacca on the east and the river port of Goalando on the west.\n\nParbati Sankar is best remembered, however, for pioneering the 'dharmagola' system of co-operative grain banking, intended to alleviate scarcity and resulting famine. 'Dharmagolas' or grain banks were established at various places within the Teota Estate and elsewhere in Dinajpur and the system was a success. These grain banks were registered as formal co-operative societies in the second decade of the 20th century. Parbati Sankar wrote a number of articles in which he not only outlined the basic features of the 'dharmagola' system, but also clearly brought out its many virtues and advantages. He spoke on the \"Indebtedness of the Bengal peasantry\" at an annual session of the Congress (INC) in the early 1900s.\n\nParbati Sankar Rai was honoured with the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in 1912.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742492", "text": "An-Nisa, 34\n\nAn-Nisa, 34 (also known as Quran 4:34) is the 34th verse of chapter (\"surah\") #4 of the Quran (titled An-Nisa/The Women).\n\nThere are a number of translations that differ on the specific interpretations of the words.\n\nMarmaduke Pickthall:\n\nMuhammad Taqi Usmani\n\nAbdullah Yusuf Ali:\n\nSahih International, at Quran.com:\n\nAhmad Shafaat:\n\nMuhsin Khan, at Quran.com:\n\nMuhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri:\n\nLaleh Bakhtiar, PhD:\nMaulvi Sher Ali on behalf of the Ahmadiyya religion:\n\nThere are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent. Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence.\n\nIn the Prophet's farewell sermon as recorded in al-Tabari's History, and similarly in a \"hadith\" collected by Abu Dawud, he instructed husbands to beat their wives, but not severely (فَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ضَرْبًا غَيْرَ مُبَرِّحٍ \"fadribuhunna darban ghayra mubarrih\"; literal translation: \"beat them, a beating without severity\") if their wives commit an immorality or adultery in the husband's absence; according to the cited farewell address sermon in al-Tabari's history, for a wife to allow someone a husband dislikes to \"tread\" on his bed means to commit sexual indecencies in the absence of the husband. This is obtained not only from the context of the sermon and the hadith cited, but also from the cited Cliff Note 772 in Vol. IX of Al-Tabari's history. Ibn 'Abbas, a companion of the Prophet, is recorded in the Tafsir of al-Tabari for verse 4:34 as saying that beating without severity is using a \"siwak\" (small tooth cleaning twig) or a similar object. There are sources that say that Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade it. In a hadith collected by Abu Dawud, Muhammad told men not to hit their wives on the face.\n\nAnother hadith narration of the Farewell Sermon appears in Sunan Ibn Majah. The Arabic phrase mentioned above is here translated, \"hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark.\"\n\nThere have been several fatwas against domestic violence. Feminist writers have argued that society during Quranic times differed from modern times, especially in how children were reared and raised, creating a need for gender roles. However, these scholars highlight that the Qur'an can be interpreted differently as society changes.\n\nJonathan A.C. Brown gives the wider scholarly tendency when it comes to the verse:\n\nThe first part of the verse about men having authority over women is meant for obedience towards God, not the husband.\n\nThe Qur'an states that men are the guardians of women, and thus responsible for earning livelihood for the family and female relatives. Women, however, are given a degree of autonomy over their own income and property, provided this autonomy is exercised in a way that is agreeable to the wishes of the husband, provided his wishes not be in violation of Islamic principles. Nevertheless, they are responsible for educating the children, as God has given the one preference over the other. Man is also considered to be the head of the family. The Qur'an recommends that wives be obedient and adaptable to their husbands. Wives should also keep the secrets of their husbands and protect their honor and integrity. Islamic scholars consider this important in running a smooth family system.\n\nFor both men and women, \"zulm\"- known in English as actions of 'cruelty' against someone- is explicitly prohibited.\n\nThe equality of men and women is discussed in many places throughout the text. The Quran blamed Adam and Eve for the original sin as Satan talks to both of them.\nThe Qur'an is also very specific that both men and women should receive equal punishment for wrongdoings (24:2), and that both men and women are seen as equals under God, and will be rewarded for their faith by entering Heaven (4:124).\n\nIn her book \"Qur'an and Women\", scholar Amina Wadud writes about the importance of women in the time of the Prophet. During this time, women did not have access to the technology that women today have; giving birth and raising children was much more difficult due to diseases and lack of healthcare knowledge. For this reason, Wadud writes, \"The Qur'an establishes his [the husband's] responsibility as \"qiwamah\": seeing to it that the women is not burdened with additional responsibilities which jeopardize that primary demanding responsibility only she can fulfill.\" The need to reproduce and raise children contributed to the importance of gender roles in the time of the Prophet.\n\nScholar Ayesha Chaudhry writes that many Muslims have this fundamentally flawed way of examining the text, writing that \"Despite the potential for such verses [4:34] to have multiple plain-sense meanings, living Muslim communities place these interpretations in conversation with the pre-colonial Islamic tradition\".\n\nThe late Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Hussein Tabataba'i (1903-1981 AD) provides the following exegesis on 4:34 from both Sunni and Shi'ite sources in his Mizan:Ibn Abi Hatim has narrated through Ash’ath ibn ‘Abdil-Malik from al-Hasan that he said: “A woman came to the Prophet complaining against her husband that he had slapped her. The Messenger of Allah said: “Retribution”. Then Allah revealed the verse, “Men are maintainers of women… (4:34); so the woman returned without retribution [ad-Durr 'l-munthur, as-Suyuti]. [as-Suyuti] has narrated it from the Prophet through other chains too. Some of them say that the Messenger of Allah said: “I wanted one thing (retribution), but Allah decided otherwise\"...there were some instances where Allah had amended some prophetic orders by adding to or deleting from it, but it was only in his administrative order, not in matters of the law ordained by him for his people, otherwise it would have been an invalid nullification...the Messenger of Allah used to wonder aloud: \"How can you embrace the woman with a hand you had hit her with?\". It is narrated also in al-Kafi through his chain from Abu Maryam from Abu Ja’far (Imam Muhammad al-Baqir) that he said: “The Messenger of Allah said: “What! Does one of you hit his wife, and then attempt to embrace her?\". Countless such statements are found in the traditions; and one may understand from them the Islamic views on this subject.Al-Tabari (839-923 AD) wrote that, \"The Prophet never raised his hand against one of his wives, or against a slave, nor against any person at all.\" In fact, when the Prophet faced rebellion of his wives, rather than beat him, Al-Tabari accounts that he instead, \"stayed away from his wives for 29 nights.\"\n\nIn response to \"nushûz\", admonishment, leaving wives in their beds and \"idribihunna\" are permitted. Islamic scholars agree such actions can not be undertaken for any reason other than those mentioned in the Qur'an (see \"nushûz\").\n\nThis allots men authority over women due to following reasons:\n1: Because God has given some more strength than others.\n2: Because men spent from their property to support women i.e., \nclothing, residence, and sustenance.The word \"qawwamun\" is also used at Al-Quran 4:134. Here it is said that believers should be Qawwamun with fairness.\n\nOne of the reason men being \"qawwamun\" over women is that God has favoured some over others.\n\nSecond reason of men being \"qawwamun\" over women is that because men are responsible of earning for women.\n\nThe verse declares that pious women are:\n1: Obedient\n2: Guarding the unseen as God prescribes.\n\nThe verse commands women to be \"qanitat\". The term has been used in to refer to men and women alike, who are obedient to God. Some commentators use the term to mean obedience to the husband, while others assert that it means obedience to God. Some \"scholars\" agree that the husband does not have absolute control over his wife, and her first loyalty is to God.\n\n\"Hafizat\" is derived from \"hafaz\" meaning to guard. The subjective form is \"hafiz\" meaning a person who guards and \"hafizah\" meaning she who guards (feminine). \"Hafizat\" is plural of \"hafizah\" (both being feminine). It means that good women guard themselves in the absence of Husband as God prescribes.\n\nAnd those whose rebellion (\"nushûz\") is feared. It is advised\n1: to admonish them\n2: to leave them alone in beds\n3: to beat them\n\n\nThe first response to \"nushuz\" is \"wā'z\" (‘وَعَظ’), meaning to first admonish or scold the wife of her behaviour. There is strong agreement amongst Muslim scholars that this admonishment must be conducted in a spirit of reconciliation.\n\nAccording to tafsir ibn kathir, a well known commentary of Quran. He describes in his exegesis.\n\nShould the \"nushuz\" continue, the next step is to refuse to share the bed with the wife. Again Muslim scholars emphasize on the spirit of healing while conducting this action.\n\nAccording to tafsir ibn Kathir.\n\nThe term \"iḍribūhunna\" (usually translated, 'beat them') in 4:34 comes from the root \"ḍaraba\" (Arabic: ضرب). The word has been used many times in the Quran to mean: to hit, to travel the earth, to set up, to condemn and to give examples. Thus scholars interpret \"iḍribūhunna\" in different ways. Whereas many interpret it to mean \"to strike\", others hold that the term means \"to separate\". Such an action is to be administered only if neither the husband nor the wife are willing to divorce. In the context of this verse, iḍribūhunna has also been interpreted to mean \"go to bed with them\", the Arabic root word \"\"daraba\"\" being taken from the prosaic example \"the stud-camel covered the she-camel\".\n\nThe term \"daraba\" is translated by Yusuf Ali as \"beat,\" but the Arabic word is used elsewhere in the Qur'an to convey different meanings. The phrase, \"\"Daraba Allah mathalan\"\" translates to, \"Allah \"gives\" or \"sets\" an example.\" The use of this word might be compared to the way \"to strike\" is used in English, which can mean, \"to strike a pose,\" or \"to strike a bargain,\" not just referring to the physical act of hitting something. The use of \"daraba\" is also intentional, because a different Arabic word exists, \"\"daraba\"\" which is translated to, \"to strike repeatedly or intensely.\"\n\nMuslim scholars who permit hitting, emphasize that it must not be harsh, but rather light. Muslim men are never to hit their spouse's face, nor to hit them in such a way as would leave marks on their body. Scholars suggest that the response administered should be in proportion to the fault committed. Traditionally the idea of beating was \"with a toothbrush\" or \"with a folded handkerchief.\" Jonathan A.C. Brown resumes the situation:If a wife exhibited egregious disobedience (nushuz) such as uncharacteristically insulting behavior, leaving the house against the husband's will and without a valid excuse or denying her husband sex (without medical grounds), the husband should first admonish her to be conscious of God and proper etiquette. If she did not desist from her behavior, he should cease sleeping with her in their bed. If she still continued in her nushuz, he should then strike her to teach her the error of her ways. Shaffii law only allowed the husband to use his hand or a wound-up handkerchief (mina malfuf), not a whip or stick. All schools of law prohibited striking the wife in the face or in any sensitive area likely to cause injury. All except some Maliki jurists held that the wife could claim compensation payment (diya) from the husband for any injury she sustained, and Hanbalis, the later Shaffii school as well as the Maliki school, allowed a judge to dissolve the marriage at no cost to the wife if harm had been done. In effect, any physical harm was grounds for compensation and divorce since the Prophet had limited striking one's wife to 'a light blow that leaves no mark.' Causing any injury thus meant that a husband had exceeded his rights. All schools of law agreed that if the wife died due to a beating, her family could claim her wergild or possibly even have the husband executed.Many jurists interpret \"iḍribūhunna\" as \"more or less symbolic.\" Others, however, argue that a mere symbolic administration would be pointless and rather should be an \"energetic demonstration\" of the love of the husband. But it is agreed that the demonstration should not seriously hurt the wife.\n\nThe 2007 translation \"The Sublime Quran\" by Laleh Bakhtiar translates \"iḍribūhunna\" not as 'beat them' but as 'go away from them'. The introduction to her translation discusses the linguistic and shari‘ah reasons in Arabic for understanding this verb in context. The Prophet never beat his wives, and his example from the Sunnah informs the interpretation of this verse. This interpretation is supported by the fact that some other verses, such as 4:101 which contains word \"darabtum\" (derivation from \"daraba\"), demonstrate also the interpretation of Arabic word \"daraba\" to have meaning 'going' or 'moving'.\n\nThe Islamic scholar Tahir-ul-Qadri has given the same translation in his translation of the Quran \"\"Irfan-ul-Quran\"\": \"(...)and (if they still do not improve) turn away from them, striking a temporary parting.(...)\". This translation is further supported by the fact that the word \"\"darabtum\"\" is used in the same chapter (specifically, in ), which means to \"go abroad\" in the sake of Allah and which is derived from the same root word (\"\"daraba\"\") as \"\"idribuhunna\"\" in 4:34.\n\nThe book \"Woman in the Shade of Islam\" by Saudi scholar Abdul Rahman al-Sheha stated that a man may \"beat\" his wife only if it occurs without \"hurting, breaking a bone, leaving blue or black marks on the body and avoiding hitting the face, at any cost.\"\n\nA widely used 1930 English translation of the Quran by British Muslim scholar Marmaduke Pickthall determined the verse to mean that, as a last resort, men can \"scourge\" their wives.\n\nSome jurists argue that even when hitting is acceptable under the Qur'an, it is still discountenanced.\n\nIn his book \"\", University of Southern California scholar Reza Aslan, stated that false interpretations of the text have occurred because Quranic commentary \"has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men.\"\n\nThe Islamic prophet Mohammed himself, according to Islamic tradition, never once struck a woman in argument. This fact is sometimes cited in debates about the text.\n\nMuslim feminist writer Asra Q. Nomani has argued, Feminist writer Amina Wadud writes in her book, <nowiki>\"</nowiki>Inside the Gender Jihad: Women's Reform in Islam<nowiki>\"</nowiki>:\n\nIbn Ishaq has said that Muhammad in his The Farewell Sermon said that:\n\nNada Ibrahim of the University of South Australia states that three words—\"qawwamuna\", \"nushuzahunna\", and \"wadribuhunna\"—are mistranslated due to the lack of equivalent English alternatives. She explains that in particular, English language Qur'an commentators have not agreed to merely one translation of the word \"wadribuhunna\" and that \"A clear disagreement exists among English-language Qur’an commentators on how best to translate this word. All translations give an explicit negative connotation, and – when read out of context – further exacerbates any misunderstanding.\"\n\nIn quran’s Commentary exegisis of this part of verse is as following:\nIn this part of verse God says that if women obey then man are not allowed to make excuses against them..\n\nIbn Kathir in the commentary of this part of verse says\n\nIt means that God is exalted.\nIt means that God is great.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7742492", "categories": ["Domestic violence", "Women's rights in Islam", "Ayat", "An-Nisa"], "title": "An-Nisa, 34"}

It was the first attempt to codify the laws of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The code prescribed punishment for property crimes and limited court procedures. Much of the legal system was left uncodified and was governed by customs.\n\nThe date or the circumstances when the code was adopted are unknown. The historians conjured that the most probable date is February 1468 when the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania met in Vilnius. The code differed from privileges previously issued by the Grand Duke because the code granted no new rights to the nobility. Judging from the content, the code was intended for the nobility and landowners, who received Casimir's privilege in 1447 to try \"veldamai\", a class of dependent people that eventually became serfs. The code attempted to impose some consistency in the treatment of \"veldamai\". The document also did not specify the effective date or territory. Historians believe that the code was in effect in entire Lithuania up to the first Statute of Lithuania of 1529 even though no court cases are known that referenced the code.\n\nWritten in the Ruthenian language, the original document did not survive, but several copies are known from the end of 15th and beginning of the 16th centuries. The document was first published in 1826 by Ignacy Daniłowicz, law professor at Vilnius University. The document did not have a proper name and was named \"Casimir's Code\" or \"Casimir's Statute\" by modern historians. The original code was not divided into articles; modern historians have identified 25 articles.\n\nThe code prescribed various punishments for crimes and some court procedures. It dealt only with crimes against property (theft and robbery). The code primarily dealt with common thieves, but also addressed crimes by the Lithuanian nobility (such as cutting forest trees without permission or luring away \"veldamai\" from another noble). The nobility was to be tried and sentenced by the Grand Duke and the Council of Lords. Civil disputes between nobles were to be decided by the third-party judges. Peasants dependent on the Grand Duke were to be tried by \"tijūnai\" (high-ranking supervisors of royal estates), while those dependent on other dukes and nobles – by the nobles themselves or their appointed officials.\n\nA criminal first had to compensate the victim for the material losses (the stolen object was usually not returned to the victim, but transferred to the court). The code devoted special attention to this issue. Then criminal was subject to the actual punishment. There were four types of punishments: the stolen object was confiscated for the benefit of the court; if the object was not available, it was replaced by other compensation of equal value; flogging and putting into stocks; hanging. The death sentence was limited to repeated offenders, thefts of cows and horses, and other crimes that exceeded a certain monetary limit. The responsibility for the crimes did not extend to family members unless they knew or participated in the theft.\n\n", "id": "7742505", "categories": ["Legal codes", "Legal history of Lithuania", "15th century in Lithuania", "1468 in Europe", "Ruthenian language", "Legal history of Belarus"], "title": "Casimir's Code"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742542", "text": "Francesco Rugeri\n\nFrancesco Rugeri (Cremona, 1628; 28 October 1698), also known as Ruger, Rugier, Rugeri, Ruggeri, Ruggieri, Ruggerius, was the first of an important family of luthiers, the Casa Rugeri in Cremona, Italy. His instruments are masterfully constructed. His violins are inspired by Nicolò Amati's \"Grand Amati\" pattern. Francesco was the first to develop a smaller cello design, which has become the standard for modern cello dimensions. Today, Rugeri's instruments are nearly as renowned as Nicolò Amati's instruments.\n\nHe was perhaps the earliest apprentice of Nicolò Amati, another important luthier in Cremona Italy, although other sources call this association into question as there is no census record showing his presence in the Amati household. The lack of census records showing the Rugeri name may be explained by the possibility of Francesco not being an indoor apprentice, but one who lived and boarded at his own home while apprenticing. Antonio Stradivari's name never appears in the census records of the Amati household even though he was also a likely pupil of Nicolò Amati and lived and boarded with his own family. W.E. Hill & Sons also note that the unmistakable handiwork of Francesco Rugeri can be found, in certain of Nicolo Amati's works, and just like Antonio Stradivari and Andrea Guarneri, Francesco from time to time included the words \"Alumnus Nicolai Amati\" on his labels, further adding to evidence of his apprenticeship. For example, there exists a violin labelled \"Francescus Rugerius Alumnus Nicolai Amati fecit Cremonæ 1663\". Nicolò Amati was the godfather to Francesco's son, Giacinto, indicating that the two families at least shared a close relationship and close collaboration would seem likely.\n\nIn support of Rugeri being a pupil of Nicolò Amati, there is a court case brought in 1685 by a violinist who sought relief from the Duke of Modena as a victim of fraud. In this case, the violinist and composer Tomaso Antonio Vitali, bought a violin purporting to be a creation of Nicolò Amati. Yet under the Amati label was the label of Francesco Rugeri. There was a price difference in those days of 3 to 1 on Amati vs. Rugeri violins, so this was a serious matter. However, this case may also indicate that Rugeri, who was working in the shadow of the great Cremona makers—Amati, Guarneri, and Stradivari—resorted to a desperate act to make a sale. The result of the court case is not known, but either scenario could prove valid.\n\nSome researchers believe there is a closer educational association between Antonio Stradivari and Francesco Rugeri than has previously been recognized. Despite the long-held belief that Antonio Stradivari was the pupil of Nicolò Amati, there are important discrepancies between their work. Some researchers believe early instruments by Stradivari bear a stronger resemblance to Francesco Rugeri's work than Amati's. Additionally, the utilization of a small dorsal pin or small hole, invariably used not just by Nicolò Amati but all of his recognized pupils—with the exception of Antonio Stradivari, adds further evidence that Stradivari may have learnt his craft apart from Amati. This pin or hole was fundamental in the graduation of the thickness of the plates and was obviously a technique passed on through generations of pupils of the Amati. This dorsal pin is also not found in any of the instruments of the Rugeri family, suggesting Antonio Stradivari may have actually learnt his craft from Francesco Rugeri, although both being influenced by Amati. W.E. Hill & Sons concede that they fail to find the hand of Stradivari in any of Nicolo Amati's work, although the unmistakable hands of Andrea Guarneri and Francesco Rugeri are evident.\n\nCount Ignazio Alessandro Cozio di Salabue and other early violin connoisseurs such as the Mantegazza brothers seemed to confuse the families of the Rugeri working in Cremona with the family of Giovanni Battista Rogeri working in Brecia. These two separate families of violin makers both followed the Amati tradition of violin making however their work is distinctive from each other are not thought to be related. The Rugeri family included the words \"il Per\" or \"detto il Per\" in their labels. This nickname appears also in almost all of the religious and legal documents pertaining to the Rugeri family from 1669 onward and was probably meant to distinguish them from the many other Rugeri families in the region.\n\nFrancesco lived and worked just outside of the walls of Cremona, Italy in the Parishes of San Bernardo at No. 7 Contrada Coltellai and also in the Parsish of San Sebastiano His most productive period was during the 1670s–1680s during which time he closely followed the instruments of Nicolò Amati, sometimes even placing Amati labels in his instruments. His success peaked after Nicolò Amati's decline and before the rise of the workshop of Antonio Stradivari. Francesco's violins were characterized by a high level of craftsmanship and a very slightly higher arch. After 1670, Francesco was ably assisted by 3 of his sons in his workshop. The Rugeri tradition was carried on and developed by Francesco's son, Vincenzo Rugeri, who was the only of his sons to later have an independent successful career as a luthier.\n\nInstruments created by Rugeri are highly desirable owing to their high level of craftsmanship and tone.\n\nFrancesco was buried in the Church of San Trinita.\n\nFrancesco Rugeri was the first to make an important contribution to cello making in the development of a smaller version of the cello that is now the standard. His cello is smaller from the cellos made by other same period Cremonese luthiers, Amati and Stradivari. Cellos made by the others luthiers are quite massive and fairly unmanageable for modern players' usage unless severely cut down in size.\n\nFrancesco is the founder of Rugeri family, also known as Ruggieri Family. Three of his four sons follow his footsteps by involving in string instruments making.\n\nOther luthiers in the family are:\n\n", "id": "7742542", "categories": ["Bowed string instrument makers", "18th-century Italian people", "1698 deaths", "17th-century Italian people", "Luthiers", "Italian musical instrument makers", "Year of birth uncertain"], "title": "Francesco Rugeri"}

It was founded in 1931.\n\nThe \"Verbond\" claims a membership of some 3,700, spread in ten different congregations throughout the country. The biggest one is the congregation in Amsterdam, with some 1,700 members. Other congregations exist in The Hague, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Arnhem (LJG Gelderland), Tilburg (LJG Brabant), Enschede (LJG Twente), Heerenveen, Zuidlaren (LJG Noord-Nederland) and Almere (LJG Flevoland). The NVPJ's rabbis are: Menno ten Brink, David Lilienthal, Awraham Soetendorp, Edward van Voolen, Marianne van Praag, Tamara Benima and Albert Ringer. It publishes its own magazine six times a year, \"Levend Joods Geloof\" (lit. Living Jewish Faith).\n\nThe \"Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom\" has separate organisations for women (FLJVN) and youngsters (Netzer Holland); there is also a separate Zionist organisation based on Progressive Jewish grounds, ARZA. It is also connected to four Jewish cemeteries: one in Hoofddorp (1937) and one in Amstelveen (2002). The Liberal communities in The Hague and Rotterdam also have their own cemetery in the town of Rijswijk, Beth Hachaim. The cemetery was founded in 1990 after several requests from members from both communities. The Congregation in Twente has its cemetery Gan ha-Olam in Enschede.\n\nProgressive Judaism was brought to the Netherlands in the 1930s by German immigrants, many of them fleeing Nazi persecution. The first Progressive rabbi in the Netherlands was Meir L. Lasker, followed by German-born Rabbi Norden. The first congregation was founded in 1931 in The Hague, in the same year followed by one in Amsterdam. The congregations grew rapidly throughout the years, mostly because of the arrival of thousands of German Jews (of whom most were part of the Reform tradition). On 18 October 1931, the \"Verbond van Liberaal-Godsdienstige Joden\" (lit. Union for Liberal-Religious Jews) was founded. Services were held regularly, and the Union published its own paper, \"Nieuw Joods Leven\" (lit. New Jewish Life).\n\nAt the eve of World War II, the Amsterdam community alone had some 900 members; ten years earlier, Progressive Judaism had virtually been non-existent in the Netherlands – the religious landscape was limited to Ashkenazi Orthodox Judaism and a smaller community of Sephardi Jews.\n\nWorld War II saw the destruction of most of Jewish life in the Netherlands during the Holocaust; more than 75% of Dutch Jews were killed by the Nazis. But the community was vibrant, and small initiatives were started in the years after the Second World War to revitalize Jewish life again, although this was hard in a country where the Jewish community had diminished from more than 140,000 in 1940 to a mere 25,000 in the 1950s. A new Liberal community was started in Amsterdam in 1946; the community had some 50 members, only a fraction of the 900 six years earlier.\n\nIt was not until the 1960s that Progressive Judaism started to grow once again in the Netherlands. Much of its success was related to the hard work of Rabbi Jacob Soetendorp, rabbi for the Liberal community in Amsterdam since 1954. Because of his hard work, new communities started to spring up again within the Jewish Netherlands – sometimes much to the disagreement of the Orthodox Jewish community in the Netherlands, combined in the \"Nederlands Israëlitisch Kerkgenootschap\", which, until this day, does not fully recognize the \"Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom\".\n\nThe 1990s and the first years of the 21st century saw a new impulse to Progressive Judaism in the Netherlands with the establishment of three new communities: one in Utrecht in 1993; one in Heerenveen (\"Beth Hatsafon\") in 2000; and one in Almere (\"Beth B'nei Jonah\") in 2003.\n\nThe Levisson Instituut was founded in 2002 with the aim to provide rabbinical training for Dutch Jewish students affiliated with the NVPJ. The institute is based on the premises of the University of Amsterdam and receives educational assistance from the Leo Baeck College in London, amongst others. \nCurrently, seven students are training at the Institute and are providing liturgical and pastoral support within the Liberal communities.\nDean of Studies is Swedish-born Rabbi David Lilienthal.\n\n\n", "id": "7742585", "categories": ["1931 establishments in the Netherlands", "Judaism in the Netherlands", "Jewish Dutch history", "Reform Judaism", "World Union for Progressive Judaism", "Jewish organisations based in the Netherlands"], "title": "Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742705", "text": "Richard Garrett &amp; Sons\n\nRichard Garrett & Sons was a manufacturer of agricultural machinery, steam engines and trolleybuses. Their factory was Leiston Works, in Leiston, Suffolk, England. The company was founded by Richard Garrett in 1778.\n\nThe company was active under its original ownership between 1778 and 1932.\n\nIn the late 1840s, after cultivating a successful agricultural machine and implement business, the company began producing portable steam engines. The company grew to a major business employing around 2,500 people. Richard Garrett III, grandson of the company's founder, visited The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, where he saw some new American manufacturing ideas. Richard Garrett III introduced flow line production – a very early assembly line - and constructed a new workshop for the purpose in 1852. This was known as 'The Long Shop' on account of its length. A machine would start at one end of the Long Shop and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added. There was also an upper level where other parts were made; they would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level. When the machine reached the end of the shop, it would be complete.\n\nIn 1914, following a major fire at the works, it was decided to build a new factory on land that had been owned as a demonstration farm next to the station. From then on the sites were always known as the \"Old Works\" and the \"New Works\".\n\nThe company joined the Agricultural & General Engineers (AGE) combine in 1919, and the combine entered receivership in 1932.\n\nThe company was purchased by Beyer Peacock in 1932 after the collapse of AGE. The business continued as Richard Garrett Engineering Works until the works finally closed in 1981.\n\nToday, part of the old works is preserved as the Long Shop Museum. Some of the offices are used as flats but the rest of that site has been demolished and the land used for housing. Some of the New Works is still used as industrial units while the offices have been converted to flats and more built on the site, known as Colonial House.\n\nThe majority of the steam engines produced by Garrett were portable engines – combined with their fixed steam engines and semi-portables, they represented 89% of the works' output.\n\nGarrett produced a wide range of traction engines and ploughing engines, 49% of which were exported.\n\nThe construction of steam rollers was generally apportioned to Aveling & Porter by the AGE combine, limiting the production of these engines by Garrett. 90% of the rollers produced by Garrett were exported. Garrett rollers were produced under licence under the name \"Ansaldo-Garrett\" by Gio. Ansaldo & C. of Italy.\n\nRichard Garrett and Sons are perhaps best known for their steam tractors, the most popular design of which was the Number 4 compound tractor, commonly referred to as the \"4CD\".\n\nThe company produced steam wagons of both the undertype and overtype configurations. Their first steam wagons were three relatively unsuccessful undertypes constructed between 1904 and 1908.\n\nThe failed undertype wagons were followed by a relatively successful line of overtypes, the first being constructed in 1909. These wagons were developed using the experience Garrett's designers had gained producing the tractors. The majority of these wagons were fitted with superheaters, a feature used as a marketing point against the un-superheated Foden wagons. The overtype wagons were initially produced in a 5-ton capacity, with a 3-ton design following in 1911. By the early 1920s, the overtype wagon market was declining in the face of competition from undertype steam wagons and petrol wagons. In 1926 a last-ditch attempt was made to produce an updated design of 6-ton capacity using components from the new undertype designs, but only 8 were produced. Overall, 693 overtypes were produced to the firm's designs.\n\nThe final Aveling & Porter overtype wagons were assembled by Garrett, under the arrangements made at the formation of AGE.\n\nBy 1920 the success of the Sentinel undertypes was evident, and Garretts decided to re-enter the undertype wagon market. Their first prototype was produced in 1921, driven by a two-cylinder engine with piston valves actuated by Joy valve gear. Unusually for the time, the wagon was fitted with Timken roller bearings on the crankshaft, countershaft and axles. This design was built under licence as the \"Adamov-Garrett\" by Adamov of Czechoslovakia from 1925. In 1926 a prototype rigid six-wheeled wagon was produced. In 1927 a poppet valve engine replaced the earlier design, this being used until the end of production in 1932. 310 wagons were produced in this second phase of undertype construction.\n\nFrom 1916 Garrett produced a range of electric vehicles. Their first foray into the market was with a 3½ ton battery-powered vehicle, intended for local deliveries. They later produced trolleybuses, beginning in 1925 and manufacturing over 100 such vehicles over the next five years, and refuse collection vehicles. Notable amongst these was the GTZ, 54 of which were made for Glasgow Corporation.\n\nGarrett were a pioneer in the construction of diesel-engined road vehicles, and their two 1928-built experimental \"Crude Oil Wagons\", known as \"COWS\" in the works, are believed to be the first British-built wagons fitted with diesel engines from new. These vehicles were constructed using the chassis and running gear from the undertype wagon designs, one a four-wheeler and the other a six-wheeler, both fitted with a McLaren Benz engine.\n\nThe \"COWS\" proved the concept of a diesel wagon, and in 1930 the company embarked on designing a production vehicle. Due to the company being part of the AGE combine, the engine chosen for the design was a Blackstone's design, the BHV6. The first vehicle, designated the \"GB6\", was completed in 1931 and a test programme was initiated. The venture was not successful, primarily due to the unreliability of the Blackstone engine, and the perilous economic state of the works at that time. After the company was bought by Beyer Peacock, a half-hearted attempt was made to market the design with a Gardner engine fitted, but no wagon was ever produced.\n\n\n", "id": "7742705", "categories": ["Manufacturing companies established in 1778", "Steam road vehicle manufacturers", "1932 disestablishments in England", "Trolleybus manufacturers", "Bus manufacturers", "1778 establishments in England", "Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1932"], "title": "Richard Garrett &amp; Sons"}

It premiered in Norway on October 13, 2006, and received huge positive reviews and was hailed as one of the best modern Norwegian horror movies.\n\nOn February 7, 2017, it was reported that WWE Studios has acquired the exclusive English-language remake rights to the franchise and has sealed a deal for an option to purchase the screenplay Casey La Scala is writing. The American remake will be named \"Cold Prey\".\n\nAs the film begins, a boy with a large birthmark covering one eye runs frantically through a blizzard in Jotunheimen, being pursued by an unknown entity. Eventually, he stumbles, and his unseen pursuer catches up to him. Despite his pleas, the person proceeds to bury him alive in the snow.\n\nYears later, a young group of friends consisting of Jannicke, her boyfriend Eirik, and their friends, Mikal, Ingunn, and Morten Tobias are going on a snowboarding vacation in Jotunheimen. They drive to a secluded area in the mountains to avoid the crowds. When they arrive at the peak, they immediately begin snowboarding down the mountain slopes. Morten Tobias suddenly takes a bad fall and breaks his leg. Jannicke takes charge and sets his leg but realizes they can't care for it properly out in the elements. They also have no cell reception and the car is too far away to get there before dark. Wandering over a hill, they spot a lodge and decide to seek help there.\n\nWhen they get to the lodge, Eirik discovers that the place is deserted. He breaks in through a window and unlocks a door. As Jannicke looks for medical supplies she comes across a box that contains superglue and a single shotgun shell. Jannicke treats Morten's broken leg with alcohol and the superglue. Eirik, Mikal and Ingunn go explore the abandoned resort, while Jannicke stays to keep Morten company. The three discover the generator, which Eirik fixes, and power is restored to the resort. Afterwards, Mikal and Ingunn run off by themselves. While exploring the various lodge suites, they discover a room in disarray with a bed burnt to cinders. Eirik, on his way back to the parlor, hears a clanking noise from down in the cellar, and assumes it's Mikal and Ingunn. He calls for them to be more careful, but he receives no reply. With the lights back on, music playing and plentiful amounts of food and alcohol, the group relaxes in the parlor. Jannicke finds the hotel's guestbook and discovers that the last guest checked in some time in 1975 and there is a message reading \"We hope you find your son\". Inside the book, there is a picture of a family that includes the boy with a birthmark over his eye. \n\nThe group settles in for the night with Mikal and Ingunn running off to a suite, Jannicke and Eirik cuddling under blankets in the parlor, and Morten Tobias alone on the couch. Making out in bed, Mikal begins to get aggressive and Ingunn shoves him off. He then leaves in a huff. Ingunn hears a strange noise and, thinking it's Mikal returning, enters the hall. She's suddenly attacked by an unknown shape and runs through the halls screaming for help but is drowned out by the music playing in the parlor. Before she can reach Mikal, who's sitting at the bar, she's stabbed by a pickaxe and dragged away. \n\nThe next morning, Eirik leaves to go for help and Mikal heads to the suite to apologize to Ingunn. Eirik stumbles across Ingunn's body in the snow. He's then smashed in the head by the blunt end of a pickaxe. Mikal gets no answer from Ingunn so he and Jannicke explore the basement. They find items that were invented long after the lodge closed in the 1970s and become nervous. Jannicke goes to talk to Ingunn and enters the suite to discover it's covered in blood. She brings Mikal and Morten Tobias to the suite just as a blast of wind flows through the hallway from an open door. They realize someone else is in the lodge and barricade themselves in an empty suite. Footsteps are heard in the hall and someone begins to slam against the door, trying to get in. When they eventually leave, Mikal tells Jannicke they should run. She points out that Morten Tobias can't and Mikal says they should just leave him. Jannicke refuses and Mikal escapes through a window. Jannicke and Morten Tobias watch through the window as Mikal hides in a shed. Suddenly, a massive Mountain Man appears outside wearing animals skins and goggles. He enters the shed and Mikal tries to run, but becomes stuck in a bear trap. The Mountain Man breaks Mikal's neck.\n\nJannicke drags Morten Tobias to a pantry and tells him to memorize the label on a can until she gets back. She narrowly misses being spotted by the Mountain Man as he drags Mikal's body inside. Jannicke runs to the shed where she finds some skis, a sled, and a shotgun. She runs into the parlor where she picks up the discarded shotgun shell and loads the gun. She goes back to the pantry and tells Morten Tobias that she has a plan.\n\nThey go down to the basement where Jannicke kills the generator, alerting the Mountain Man to their whereabouts. Morten Tobias finds a box cutter and puts it in his pocket. Jannicke waits for the Mountain Man to appear so she can shoot him but discovers the keys she gave to Eirik on the floor. When she enters the back room she finds Eirik tied up but alive. Unable to free him, she goes back to wait for the Mountain Man. When he appears, he goes straight into the back room. Jannicke points the gun at him, but he shuts off his flashlight and disappears into darkness. Thinking quickly, Jannicke shuts the door and locks him in the back room but refuses to leave him in there with Eirik. Opening the door, she shoots but is knocked askew by Morton Tobias who realizes the Mountain Man is using Eirik as a human shield. The Mountain Man impales Eirik with his pickaxe, killing him. Morten Tobias tells Jannicke to run. He tries to stop the Mountain Man with a saw but to no avail, and The Mountain Man kills him. Jannicke grabs her skis and runs outside into the darkness only to be knocked out by the Mountain Man. \n\nWhen she awakes, she's on the sled, buried under her dead friends. The Mountain Man brings them to a deep ravine and begins tossing the bodies over one by one. Jannicke grabs the box cutter out of Morten Tobias's pocket and lies still. Jannicke is the last to be dragged off the sled and, as the Mountain Man grabs her, she stabs him in the neck with the box cutter. They struggle over the pickaxe and end up on the ground by the edge of the ravine. As the Mountain Man is about to stab Jannicke, she rips off his goggles revealing a birthmark over his eye. Taken by surprise, the Mountain Man lets his guard down. Jannicke grabs his pickaxe and stabs him in the stomach, sending him over the ravine.\n\nIn a flashback, we see the Mountain Man as a boy, running from his pursuer. As he's covered in the snow, he looks up to see the faces of his parents, burying him alive.\n\nThe Mountain Man hits the bottom of the ravine, surrounded by the bodies of Jannicke's friends. Jannicke, exhausted collapses into the snow.\n\n\nThe movie was shot at the peak of Jotunheimen. Helicopters flew the 20 tons of equipment to the top of the mountain where the temperature was below −25 degrees Celsius.

Early virtual modelling involved the fixing of arbitrary lines and points in virtual space, mainly to produce technical drawings. Modern packages include advanced features such as databases of components, automated engineering calculations, visual fly-throughs, dynamic reflections, and accurate textures and colours.\n\nAs an extension to CAD (computer-aided design) and BIM (building information modelling), virtual reality architectural sessions are also being adopted at increasingly faster rates. As this technology enables participants to be immersed in a 1:1 scale model, essentially experiencing the building before it is even being built.\n\nRough study models can be made quickly using cardboard, wooden blocks, polystyrene, foam, foam boards and other materials. Such models are an efficient design tool for three-dimensional understanding of a structure, space or form, used by architects, interior designers and exhibit designers.\n\nCommon materials used for centuries in architectural model building were card stock, balsa wood, basswood and other woods. Modern professional architectural model builders are taking advantage of twenty-first century materials, such as Taskboard (a flexible and lightweight wood/fiber board), plastics, wooden and wooden-plastic composites, foams, foam board and urethane compounds.\nA number of companies produce ready-made pieces for structural components (e.g. girders, beams), siding, furniture, figures (people), vehicles, trees, bushes and other features which are found in the models. Features such as vehicles, people figurines, trees, street lights and other are called \"scenery elements\" and serve not only to beautify the model, but also to help the observer to obtain a correct feel of scale and proportions represented by the model.\n\nIncreasingly, rapid prototyping techniques such as 3D printing and CNC routing are used to automatically construct models straight from CAD plans.\n\nArchitectural models are being constructed at much smaller scale than their 1:1 counterpart.\n\nThe scales and their architectural use is broadly as follows:\n\nSometimes model railroad scales such as and are used due to ready availability of commercial figures, vehicles and trees in those scales, and models of large buildings are most often built in approximately that range of scales due to size considerations.\n\n", "id": "7742793", "categories": ["Architectural communication", "Architecture", "Crafts"], "title": "Architectural model"}

On 24 April 2011 he netted his first Spanish top flight goal in a 1–0 home win against Deportivo de La Coruña, adding a second two games later against Racing de Santander in a 2–3 home loss, but the team from Alicante was eventually relegated after only one year.\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Gomes signed a one-year deal with Football League Championship club Blackpool after his contract with Hércules expired.\n\nHe made his competitive debut on 18 August by starting and playing 56 minutes in a 2–0 success at Millwall, and finished his first and only season with 27 overall appearances (no goals).\n\nOn 14 June 2013, Gomes moved teams and countries again, penning a two-year contract with APOEL FC from Cyprus. He made his debut against NK Maribor on 31 July, in a 1–1 home draw for the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. During the 2013–14 season he appeared in three games in the group stage of the UEFA Europa League, and helped his side conquer the treble of league, Cup and Super Cup.\n\nGomes scored his first official goal for APOEL on 21 March 2015, in his team's 2–2 home draw against Apollon Limassol for the league playoffs. In his second year, he played every game in his team's Champions League campaign.\n\nOn 25 May 2015, one day after winning his second consecutive double, Gomes left the club as it was announced his contract would not be renewed.\n\nGomes made two appearances for Portugal at under-21 level, his first call-up being in March 2007.\n\n\n", "id": "7742885", "categories": ["Segunda División players", "FC Steaua București players", "Portuguese footballers", "LigaPro players", "Nea Salamis Famagusta FC players", "Clube Oriental de Lisboa players", "Odivelas F.C. players", "Association football midfielders", "Portugal under-21 international footballers", "Doxa Katokopia players", "Primeira Liga players", "Portuguese expatriate footballers", "English Football League players", "G.D.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742919", "text": "The Alien (unproduced film)\n\nThe Alien was an unproduced Indian-American science fiction film in development in the late 1960s which was eventually cancelled. It was to be directed by celebrated Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray and co-produced by Columbia Pictures. The script was written by Ray in 1967, loosely based on Bankubabur Bandhu (\"Banku Babu's Friend\" or \"Mr. Banku's Friend\"), a Bengali science fiction story he had written in 1962 for \"Sandesh\", the Ray family magazine, which gained popularity among Bengalis in the early 1960s. \"Bankubabur Bandhu\" was eventually adapted into a television film by Satyajit Ray's son Sandip Ray, and a play by the theatre group Swapnasandhani Kaushik Sen, in 2006.\n\nThe plot revolves around a spaceship that lands in a pond in rural Bengal. The villagers begin worshiping it as a temple risen from the depths of the earth. The alien, known as \"Mr Ang\", establishes contact with a young village boy named Haba (meaning \"Dumb\" in Bengali) through dreams and also plays a number of pranks on the village community in the course of its short stay on planet Earth. The plot contains the ebullient presence of an Indian businessman, a journalist from Calcutta and an American engineer.\n\nRay's biographer W. Andrew Robinson describes one particular scene from the screenplay as follows: \"In a series of fantastically quick, short steps over the lotus leaves, the Alien reaches the shore of the pond. He looks down at the grass, examines the blade and is off hopping into the bamboo grove. There the Alien sees a small plant. His eyes light up with a yellow light. He passes his hand over the plant, and flowers come out. A thin, soft high-pitched laugh shows the Alien is pleased.\"\n\n\"The Alien\" had Columbia Pictures as producer for this planned US–India co-production, and Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando acting in lead roles. However, Ray was surprised to find that the script he had written had already been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Michael Wilson (Ray's representative in Hollywood). Wilson had copyrighted the script as co-writer, despite not being involved in any way in its creation. Marlon Brando later dropped out of the project and though an attempt was made to bring James Coburn in his place, Ray became disillusioned and returned to Calcutta. Columbia expressed interest in reviving the project several times in the 1970s and 1980s but nothing came of it.\n\nWhen the film \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" was produced in 1982, Ray noted similarities in the movie to his own earlier script. Ray discussed the collapse of the project in a 1980 \"Sight & Sound\" feature, with further details revealed by his biographer Andrew Robinson (in \"The Inner Eye\", 1989). Ray claimed that Steven Spielberg's film \"would not have been possible without my script of \"The Alien\" being available throughout America in mimeographed copies.\" When the issue was raised by the press, Spielberg denied this claim and said \"I was a kid in high school when his script was circulating in Hollywood.\" \"Star Weekend Magazine\" disputes Spielberg's claim, pointing out that he had graduated from high school in 1965 and began his career as a director in Hollywood in 1969. \"The Times of India\" noted that \"E.T.\" and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977) had \"remarkable parallels\" with \"The Alien\". These parallels include the physical nature of the alien. In his screenplay, which Ray wrote entirely in English, he described the alien as \"a cross between a gnome and a famished refugee child: large head, spindly limbs, a lean torso. Is it male or female or neuter? We don't know. What its form basically conveys is a kind of ethereal innocence, and it is difficult to associate either great evil or great power with it; yet a feeling of eeriness is there because of the resemblance to a sickly human child.\"\n\nThe 2003 Bollywood film \"Koi... Mil Gaya\", directed by Rakesh Roshan, appears to be based on Satyajit Ray's \"The Alien\". In particular, the film appears to parallel \"The Alien\" more closely than \"E.T.\" in that it revolves around an intellectually challenged person coming in contact with a friendly alien.\n\nIn 2003, Satyajit Ray's son Sandip Ray began working on adapting Ray's original 1962 story \"Bankubabur Bandhu\" into a Bengali television movie of the same name. The adapted film, directed by Kaushik Sen, was eventually shown on television in India in 2006. This version is based on Ray's original story \"Bankubabur Bandhu\" where the protagonist was a school teacher named Banku Babu, in contrast to his script for \"The Alien\" where the protagonist was a boy named Haba.\n\n", "id": "7742919", "categories": ["Indian-American films", "Films involved in plagiarism controversies", "Cancelled films", "Bengali-language literature", "Unproduced screenplays"], "title": "The Alien (unproduced film)"}

Licensed to Ogden, Utah, United States, the station serves the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. The station is currently owned by Cumulus Media. The station's studios are located in South Salt Lake (behind the I-15/I-80 interchange).\n\nPrior to March 1986, KBER was known as KDAB, and was licensed to Ogden (as KBER is to this day). It was known then as \"B101\". KBER began on 106.5, but moved to its current dial position in March 1990. It was purchased by Citadel Broadcasting during that time. It also morphed into \"101 The Bear\". The station employed a number of on-air talent including \"Uncle Nasty\". Uncle Nasty's irreverent style translated into an instant following especially with Men 18-34. Uncle Nasty was on air 7pm to 12am, then moved to morning drive a year later. In 1998 the station reverted to the more familiar \"KBER 101\" slogan of its earlier years and is currently a top rated mainstream rock station in Salt Lake City Utah. By 2008, the station's sister station KHTB became a modern rock station, carrying mostly newer rock. KBER gradually began to change its playlist to include more classic rock songs, although it has since returned to a mainstream rock format. Later on, Mediabase & Nielsen BDS began reporting KBER on the mainstream rock panel. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.\n\nThe station arrived as one of the leading FM radio stations in the market with on air personalities Street and Katherine, Tom Collins, Kevin Lewis, John Edwards, Mark Christiansen and Jay \"J-bear\" Stevens to name a few. The early to mid 90's were the wild days with Cory \"Porn Master\" Draper, Casey \"The Night Rocker\" Baird, Kevin \"Easy\" Eason, Alan \"Dr. Rock\" Bain, Mark \"Erection\" Erickson, \"Young Hung\" Brandon Young, Ron Harrison, Allen \"My Wife has me by the Balls\" Handy, Helmut \"No longer a part timer\" Von Schmidt, Chris Howey \"Opie Asswipe\", Jamie \"Hymie Escalante\" Valle'e, the screaming weather man, Patrick \"Skye Bleu\" Burton, Michael Hayes, Nate \"The Hitman\" and others. Those were the days of Mike Marble's wildly successful KBER-RAFTERS Showcase Concert Series.\n\nThe Ron & Allen Morning Show was wildly popular and they even had their own television show called \"Rock Utah\" which aired on local channel 30. Some of the more memorable events the morning show perpetrated were the \"Heterosexual Pride Parade\", a wrestling match between Ron and the \"Punisher\" against Allen and Hymie, which raised money for the MDA, Hymie taking the morn show and some listeners skydiving, Allen and Hymie driving a top fuel dragster at Bonneville Raceway, and a hoax which had listeners believing that Allen Handy had been arrested by the Secret Service. The show was every bit as wild as anything being done at the time in the largest markets, including Howard Stern in New York City. After Ron Harrison was summarily dismissed for an on-air stunt, Allen Handy and Michael Hayes took over as \"Handy & Hayes\" for several months carrying on the tradition of placing within the top 1-2 stations in the 18-34 demographic within Salt Lake City's market.\n\nDarby (now with sister station KENZ) hosted the midday show prior to Kelly Hammer taking over in 2008. Prior to Darby, the midday shift was hosted by Helen Powers, who went on to work for a number of other radio stations.\n\nMornings during the week on KBER previously featured the syndicated \"Bob and Tom Show\" (1998–present). The morning show is now handled by Victor Cade along with co-host Rebecca Cade (no relation). Marci Wiser is the mid-day rock diva. Mick and Allen's \"Freak Show\" airs in the afternoons and is followed by Helmut Radio. Mick and Allen returned to KBER in 2005. Weekends are currently hosted by Alan Bain, Casey Baird (who returned to KBER in 2016) and Victor Cade. \"The Jimbo Show\" airs Saturday nights 7 - midnight. Jimbo is also on Mick & Allen's \"Freakshow\". At 8 PM on Sunday nights, \"Corky\" hosts the \"Salt Lake Soundcheck,\" which is one of only a handful of shows that airs local talent on Utah radio. Mitch is on Sunday nights following the \"Salt Lake Soundcheck\" as well as some weekday over-nights. Weekday overnights are also hosted by radio veteran Michael Cain. Along with regular shows, the station also does live broadcasts during business or station promotions at various events. Every year, KBER hosts an event known as \"The North Pole Express\" which is a take on the story \"The Polar Express\" and is an event co-hosted by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It is held at Soldier Hollow, outside of Heber, Utah.\n\nKBER broadcasts an HD signal along with analog on 101.1 MHz. Its transmitter is located southwest of Salt Lake City on Farnsworth Peak. As with its sister FM stations, the station has an ERP of 25,000 watts. This, along with the characteristics and elevation of Farnsworth Peak allow KBER to be received in most of northern Utah, specifically the Wasatch Front.\n\n", "id": "7742920", "categories": ["Radio stations established in 1986", "Mainstream rock radio stations in the United States", "Radio stations in Utah", "Cumulus Media radio stations", "Media in Salt Lake City"], "title": "KBER"}

The word 'Azeez' is the Qur'an's honorific title designated for Potiphar.\n\nThe Bible (Genesis 39:5-20) narrates her treatment of Joseph, slave to her husband Potiphar:\n\nA story about Zuleikha is told in Sefer haYashar, where she was mocked by other aristocratic Egyptian ladies, her circle of friends, for being infatuated with a Hebrew slave boy. Inviting her friends to her home, Zuleikha gave them all oranges and knives to slice them with. While they engaged in this task, Zuleikha had Joseph walk through the room. Distracted by his handsomeness, all the ladies accidentally cut themselves with the knives, drawing blood. Zuleikha then reminded her friends that she had to see Joseph every day. Following this incident, her contemporaries no longer mocked her.\n\nChristian and other scriptural commentators have regarded Zuleikha as a sinner and villainess. Notable exceptions are the great Sufi mystic poets Rumi and Hafiz. For Rumi, Zuleikha's obsession with Joseph is a symptom and manifestation of the soul's great deep longing for God. This, he insists, is true of any person's deep love for another. Jewish commentators also see some good motives in her actions. Rashi comments that the wife of Potiphar saw through astrology that she would have children through Joseph. The astrological calculations however were slightly off. Asenath, her daughter (by adoption, in some accounts) became the wife of Joseph and therefore the wife of Potiphar begot grandchildren (not children) through Joseph.\n\n", "id": "7742992", "categories": [], "title": "Zuleikha (tradition)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742998", "text": "Agricultural &amp; General Engineers\n\nAgricultural & General Engineers Limited (AGE) was a holding company formed on 4 June 1919 during a postwar economic \"boom\" to combine five British engineering companies: Aveling & Porter, E H Bentall, Blackstone, Richard Garrett and J & F Howard. The holding company's business was described to the judge considering its 1932 winding up as: \"agricultural, transport, road, constructional and general engineers\".\n\nIt paid no dividend on any class of its shares and after a catastrophic trading loss in 1931 and allegations of fraud was liquidated following Barclays Bank's successful application for the winding up order made by the court in April 1932. Many of its subsidiaries were revived as independent businesses.\n\nThomas Lake Aveling and Frank Garrett wanted to bring together a number of agricultural machinery businesses into one strong combine where they would be rationalised and their efficiency improved. They planned to end competition between members in their home market and create a business large enough to compete with the North American firms in export markets. \n\nHowever the centralisation of purchasing, which was soon dispensed with, sales and finance in expensive London headquarters created a heavy financial burden not justified by its benefits. As it turned out lack of competition in the home market seemed to inhibit innovation and responses to market conditions. Subsidiaries moved rather late from steam to internal combustion engines. The substantial profits of some combine members shored up weaker members and supported the expensive headquarters and that left no income for the shareholders.\n\nShares were offered to the general public in November 1919 for the funds needed to carry out this large holding company plan and the issue was completed and listed on the London Stock Exchange a week later. The principal subscriptions may have come from the previous owners of the new subsidiaries. \n\nConstituent companies were assigned sectors of the market to reduce competition within the group. The group headquarters were located in AGE's own impressive Aldwych House in Aldwych, London, but most of the member companies were in rural areas. Negotiations for the site in Aldwych were completed in early January 1920, AGE were in occupation in early 1924 and the building was finally completed in 1926.\n\nFollowing difficult trading conditions the company's capital was \"heavily written down\" in 1924 from £8 million to £6.7 million.\nIn October 1928 the chairman was able to report there were close on 10,000 \"workpeople\" in AGE's employ and the various works covered a total of 350 acres. The sharp slumps and difficult strikes of the 1920s had not been foreseen and with ample capital large extensions were made to the works and plants of the constituent businesses. By 1924 plant and buildings were utilised to less than one-third of their capacity. Speaking to shareholders in October 1928 the chairman hoped they would become fully employed in the 1930s.

Goethals made her acting debut in the Broadway production of \"Coastal Disturbances\" in 1987, and later became known for her role in \"Home Alone\" (1990) playing the sister of Macaulay Culkin's character in the film. Throughout the 1990s, Goethals went on to star in several independent films and television shows, including a leading role on the sitcom \"Phenom\" (1993), as well as a small role in \"Jerry Maguire\" (1996).\n\nIn 1999, Goethals graduated from Vassar college with a B.A. in French before returning to acting. In 2005, she landed a recurring guest appearance on \"24\", and also gained recognition and critical acclaim for her starring role in the black comedy horror mockumentary, \"\" (2006).\n\nGoethals was born and raised in New York City, New York, the daughter of Rosalind, a teacher and single mom who raised Angela and her sister Sara. She is a great-great-granddaughter of George Washington Goethals, the chief engineer of the Panama Canal, and namesake of New York's Goethals Bridge. Goethals was a cheerleader at Stuyvesant High School and was introduced to the acting world by actress Jeanie Hackett, a family friend, who took her to several auditions. At the age of nine she got her first professional acting job, as the understudy to Sarah Michelle Gellar in \"The Widow Claire\", an off-Broadway play written by Horton Foote. Two years later Goethals appeared as the daughter of Edwin Booth, portrayed by David Strathairn, in a workshop production of \"Booth: A House Divided\", at The Players, New York City.\n\nGoethals appeared in her first movie, drama \"Rocket Gibraltar\", two years later. The cast included Burt Lancaster, Kevin Spacey and Macaulay Culkin. Her sister Sara also had a small part. Later that year Goethals also appeared in \"Heartbreak Hotel\", a film directed by Chris Columbus about the fictional kidnapping of Elvis Presley.\nGoethals's first starring role came in the 1993 TV series \"Phenom\". She played Angela Doolan, a young tennis player struggling with the challenges of life including her single mother (Judith Light), obsessive tennis coach (William Devane) and bratty younger sister (Ashley Johnson). It ran for 22 episodes before being cancelled by network ABC in May 1994.\n\nIn 1990, Goethals played Linnie, the sister of main character Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin), in \"Home Alone\". The blockbuster family comedy, directed by Chris Columbus, is about a young boy facing two inept burglars when he's left home alone. The movie made nearly $500m worldwide. Goethals was one of only three main cast members not to return in the sequel, \"\", two years later.\n\nGoethals's next role in a blockbuster movie came in 1996's \"Jerry Maguire\", a film that starred Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Renée Zellweger. Goethals played Kathy Sanders, Jerry's client who fakes tears when he calls her to inform her of his departure from the agency.\n\nIn 1999, Goethals graduated from the private liberal arts college, Vassar, with a bachelor's degree in French, in which she is fluent, and she rode in the IHSA Zone II Region 1 at the Advanced Walk-Trot-Canter level. In February 2002 she moved back to Los Angeles to pursue film and television.\n\n2002 saw Goethals star as Polly in Comedy Central's first original movie, \"Porn 'n Chicken\". The movie was based on the true story of the Porn 'n Chicken Club at Yale University. Its members gathered weekly to eat fried chicken and watch porn. The club made headlines in 2001 when members announced plans to make their own porn film, entitled \"\"The StaXXX\"\". Despite a trailer being released for their film, it was never finished and no further footage ever emerged. Later in 2002, Goethals also starred in the 1980s based sitcom \"Do Over\". The show featured Penn Badgley as 34-year-old Joel Larsen, catapulted back in time to 1981 and forced to relive his school life.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7743069", "text": "Missouri Compromise\n\nThe Missouri Compromise was the legislation that provided for the admission of Maine to the United States as a free state along with Missouri as a slave state, thus maintaining the balance of power between North and South in the United States Senate. As part of the compromise, slavery was prohibited north of the 36°30′ parallel, excluding Missouri. The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3, 1820, and President James Monroe signed it on March 6, 1820.\nEarlier, on February 1819, Representative James Tallmadge Jr., a Jeffersonian Republican from New York, submitted two amendments to Missouri's request for statehood, which included restrictions on slavery. Southerners objected to any bill which imposed federal restrictions on slavery, believing that slavery was a state issue settled by the Constitution. However, with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates, both sections possessing 11 states, the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage. Northern critics including Federalists and Democratic-Republicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana Purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the three-fifths rule, which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a states' slave population. Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds. \"[Northern] Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments, not on expediency, but in egalitarian morality\"; and \"The Constitution, [said northern Jeffersonians] strictly interpreted, gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten [the] removal [of slavery], including the refusal to admit additional slave states.\".\n\nWhen free-soil Maine offered its petition for statehood, the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills, making Maine admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union with slavery unrestricted. Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso, excluding slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by those Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri. Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky, in a desperate bid to break the deadlock, divided the Senate bills. Clay and his pro-compromise allies succeeded in pressuring half the anti-restrictionist House Southerners to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso, while maneuvering a number of restrictionist House northerners to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state. The Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4, 1819, the House sustaining its northern antislavery position, and the Senate blocking a slavery restricted statehood.\n\nThe Missouri Compromise was controversial at the time, as many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectional lines. The bill was effectively repealed in the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, and declared unconstitutional in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" (1857). This increased tensions over slavery and eventually led to the Civil War.\n\nThe Era of Good Feelings, closely associated with the administration of President James Monroe (1817–1825), was characterized by the dissolution of national political identities. With the discredited Federalists in decline nationally, the \"amalgamated\" or hybridized Republicans adopted key Federalist economic programs and institutions, further erasing party identities and consolidating their victory.\nThe economic nationalism of the Era of Good Feelings that would authorize the Tariff of 1816 and incorporate the Second Bank of the United States portended an abandonment of the Jeffersonian political formula for strict construction of the constitution, a limited central government and commitments to the primacy of Southern agrarian interests. The end of opposition parties also meant the end of party discipline and the means to suppress internecine factional animosities. Rather than produce political harmony, as President James Monroe had hoped, amalgamation had led to intense rivalries among Jeffersonian Republicans.\nIt was amid the \"good feelings\" of this period – during which Republican Party discipline was in abeyance – that the Tallmadge Amendment surfaced.\n\nThe immense Louisiana Purchase territories had been acquired through federal executive action, followed by Republican legislative authorization in 1803 during the Thomas Jefferson administration.\n\nPrior to its purchase in 1803, the governments of Spain and France had sanctioned slavery in the region. In 1812, the state of Louisiana, a major cotton producer and the first to be carved from the Louisiana Purchase, had entered the Union as a slave state. Predictably, Missourians were adamant that slave labor should not be molested by the federal government. In the years following the War of 1812, the region, now known as Missouri Territory, experienced rapid settlement, led by slaveholding planters.\n\nAgriculturally, the land comprising the lower reaches of the Missouri River, from which that new state would be formed, had no prospects as a major cotton producer. Suited for diversified farming, the only crop regarded as promising for slave labor was hemp culture. On that basis, southern planters immigrated with their chattel to Missouri, the slave population rising from 3,100 in 1810 to 10,000 in 1820. In a total population 67,000, slaves represented about 15 percent.\n\nBy 1818, the population of Missouri territory was approaching the threshold that would qualify it for statehood. An enabling act was provided to Congress empowering territorial residents to select convention delegates and draft a state constitution. The admission of Missouri territory as a slave state was expected to be more or less routine.\n\nWhen the Missouri statehood bill was opened for debate in the House of Representative on February 13, 1819, early exchanges on the floor proceeded without serious incident. In the course of these proceedings, however, Representative James Tallmadge Jr. of New York \"tossed a bombshell into the Era of Good Feelings\" with the following amendments:\n\nA political outsider, the 41-year old Tallmadge conceived his amendment based on a personal aversion to slavery. He had played a leading role in accelerating emancipation of the remaining slaves in New York in 1817. Moreover, he had campaigned against Illinois' Black Codes: though ostensibly free-soil, the new Illinois state constitution permitted indentured servitude and a limited form of slavery. As a New York Republican, Tallmadge maintained an uneasy association with Governor DeWitt Clinton, a former Republican who depended on support from ex-Federalists. Clinton's faction was hostile to Tallmadge for his spirited defense of General Andrew Jackson over his contentious invasion of Florida.\nTallmadge had to back from a fellow New York Republican, Congressman John W. Taylor (not to be confused with legislator John Taylor of Caroline County, Virginia). Taylor also had antislavery credentials: In February 1819, he had proposed similar slave restrictions on Arkansas territory in the House, but failed 89-87. He would lead the pro-Tallmadge antislavery forces during the 16th Congress in 1820.\n\nThe amendment instantly exposed the polarization among Jeffersonian Republicans over the future of slavery in the nation.\nNorthern Jeffersonian Republicans formed a coalition across factional lines with remnants of the Federalists. Southern Jeffersonian united in almost unanimous opposition. The ensuing debates pitted the northern \"restrictionists\" (antislavery legislators who wished to bar slavery from the Louisiana territories) and southern \"anti-restrictionists\" (proslavery legislators who rejected any interference by Congress inhibiting slavery expansion).\nThe sectional \"rupture\" over slavery among Jeffersonian Republicans, first exposed in the Missouri crisis, had its roots in the Revolutionary generation.\n\nFive Congressmen in Maine were opposed to spreading slavery into new territories. Dr. Brian Purnell, professor of Africana Studies and U.S. history at Bowdoin College, writes in Portland Magazine, \"Martin Kinsley, Joshua Cushman, Ezekiel Whitman, Enoch Lincoln, and James Parker—wanted to prohibit slavery's spread into new territories. In 1820, they voted against the Missouri Compromise and against Maine's independence. In their defense, they wrote that, if the North, and the nation, embarked upon this Compromise—and ignored what experiences proved, namely that southern slave holders were determined to dominate the nation through ironclad unity and perpetual pressure to demand more land, and more slaves—then these five Mainers declared Americans \"shall deserve to be considered a besotted and stupid race, fit, only, to be led blindfold; and worthy, only, to be treated with sovereign contempt.\"\n\nThe Missouri crisis marked a rupture in the Republican Ascendency – the national association of Jeffersonian Republicans that dominated national politics in the post-War of 1812 period.\n\nThe Founders had inserted both principled and expedient elements in the establishing documents. The Declaration of Independence of 1776 was grounded on the claim that liberty established a moral ideal that made universal equality a common right. The Revolutionary War generation had formed a government of limited powers in 1787 to embody the principles in the Declaration, but \"burdened with the one legacy that defied the principles of 1776\": human bondage. In a pragmatic commitment to form the Union, the federal apparatus would forego any authority to directly interfere with the institution of slavery where it existed under local control within the states. This acknowledgment of state sovereignty provided for the participation of those states most committed to slave labor. With this understanding, slaveholders had cooperated in authorizing the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, and to outlawing the trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1808. Though the Founders sanctioned slavery, they did so with the implicit understanding that the slaveholding states would take steps to relinquish the institution as opportunities arose.\nSouthern states, after the War for Independence, had regarded slavery as an institution in decline (with the exception of Georgia and South Carolina). This was manifest in the shift towards diversified farming in the Upper South, and in the gradual emancipation of slaves in New England, and more significantly, in the mid-Atlantic states. Beginning in the 1790s, with the introduction of the cotton gin, and by 1815, with the vast increase in demand for cotton internationally, slave-based agriculture underwent an immense revival, spreading the institution westward to the Mississippi River. Slavery opponents in the South vacillated, as did their hopes for the imminent demise of human bondage.\nHowever rancorous the disputes among Southerners themselves over the virtues of a slave-based society, they united as a section when confronted by external challenges to their institution. The free states were not to meddle in the affairs of the slaveholders. Southern leaders – of whom virtually all identified as Jeffersonian Republicans – denied that Northerners had any business encroaching on matters related to slavery. Northern attacks on the institution were condemned as incitements to riot among the slave populations – deemed a dire threat to white southern security.\n\nNorthern Jeffersonian Republicans embraced the Jeffersonian antislavery legacy during the Missouri debates, explicitly citing the Declaration of Independence as an argument against expanding the institution. Southern leaders, seeking to defend slavery, would renounce the document's universal egalitarian applications and its declaration that \"all men are created equal.\"\n\nArticle One, Section Two of the US Constitution supplemented legislative representation in those states where residents owned slaves. Known as the three-fifths clause or the \"federal ratio\", three-fifths (60%) of the slave population was numerically added to the free population. This sum was used to calculate Congressional districts per state and the number of delegates to the Electoral College. The federal ratio produced a significant number of legislative victories for the South in the years preceding the Missouri crisis, as well as augmenting its influence in party caucuses, the appointment of judges and the distribution of patronage. It is unlikely that the three-fifths clause, prior to 1820, was decisive in affecting legislation on slavery. Indeed, with the rising northern representation in the House, the South's share of the membership had declined since the 1790s.\n\nHostility to the federal ratio had historically been the object of the now nationally ineffectual Federalists; they blamed their collective decline on the \"Virginia Dynasty\", expressed in partisan terms rather than in moral condemnation of slavery. The pro-De Witt Clinton-Federalist faction carried on the tradition, posing as antirestrictionists, for the purpose of advancing their fortunes in New York politics.\n\nSenator Rufus King of New York, a Clinton associate, was the last Federalist icon still active on the national stage, a fact irksome to Southern Republicans. A signatory to the US Constitution, he had strongly opposed the three-fifths rule in 1787. In the 1819 15th Congress debates, he revived his critique as a complaint that New England and the Mid-Atlantic States suffered unduly from the federal ratio, declaring himself \"degraded\" (politically inferior) to the slaveholders. Federalists, North and South, preferred to mute antislavery rhetoric, but during the 1820 debates in the 16th Congress, King and other old Federalists would expand their critique to include moral considerations of slavery.\n\nRepublican James Tallmadge, Jr. and the Missouri restrictionists deplored the three-fifths clause because it had translated into political supremacy for the South. They had no agenda to remove it from the founding document, only to prevent its further application west of the Mississippi River.\n\nAs determined as Southern Republicans were to secure Missouri statehood with slavery, the three-fifths clause failed to provide the margin of victory in the 15th Congress. Blocked by Northern Republicans – largely on egalitarian grounds – with sectional support from Federalists, the bill would die in the upper house, where the federal ratio had no relevance. The \"balance of power\" between the sections, and the maintenance of Southern preeminence on matters related to slavery resided in the Senate.\n\nNorthern voting majorities in the lower house did not translate into political dominance. The fulcrum for proslavery forces resided in the upper house of Congress. There, constitutional compromise in 1787 had provided for exactly two senators per state, regardless of its population: the South, with its small white demographic relative to the North, benefited from this arrangement. Since 1815, sectional parity in the Senate had been achieved through paired admissions, leaving the North and South, at the time of Missouri territory application for statehood, at eleven states each.\n\nThe South, voting as a bloc on measures that challenged slaveholding interests and augmented by defections from Free State Senators with Southern sympathies, was able to tally majorities. The Senate stood as the bulwark and source of the Slave Power – a power that required admission of slave states to the Union to preserve its national primacy.\n\nMissouri statehood, with the Tallmadge amendment approved, would set a trajectory towards a Free State trans-Mississippi and a decline in Southern political authority. The question as to whether the Congress could lawfully restrain the growth of slavery in Missouri took on great importance among the slave states. The moral dimensions of the expansion of human bondage would be raised by Northern Republicans on constitutional grounds.\n\nThe Tallmadge amendment was \"the first serious challenge to the extension of slavery\" and raised questions concerning the interpretation of the republics' founding documents.\n\nJeffersonian Republicans justified Tallmadge's slavery restrictions on the grounds that Congress possessed the authority to impose territorial statutes which would remain in force after statehood was established. Representative John W. Taylor pointed to Indiana and Illinois, where their Free State status conformed to the antislavery provisions in the Northwest Ordinance.\n\nFurther, antislavery legislators invoked Article Four, Section Four of the Constitution, which required that states provide a republican form of government. As the Louisiana Territory was not part of the United States in 1787, they argued, introducing slavery into Missouri would thwart the egalitarian intent of the Founders.\n\nProslavery Republicans countered that the Constitution had long been interpreted as having relinquished any claim to restricting slavery within the states. The free inhabitants of Missouri, either in the territorial phase or during statehood, had the right to establish slavery – or disestablish it – exclusive of central government interference. As to the Northwest Ordinance, Southerners denied that this could serve as a lawful antecedent for the territories of the Louisiana Purchase, as the ordinance had been issued originally under the Articles of Confederation, not under the US Constitution.\n\nAs a legal precedent, they offered the treaty acquiring the Louisiana lands in 1803: the document included a provision (Article 3) that extended the rights of US citizens to all inhabitants of the new territory, including the protection of property in slaves. When slaveholders embraced Jeffersonian constitutional strictures on a limited central government they were reminded that Jefferson, as US President in 1803, had deviated from these precepts when he wielded federal executive power to double the size the United States (including the lands under consideration for Missouri statehood). In doing so, he set a Constitutional precedent that would serve to rationalize Tallmadge's federally imposed slavery restrictions.\n\nThe 15th Congress debates, focusing as it did on constitutional questions, largely avoided the moral dimensions raised by the topic of slavery. That the unmentionable subject had been raised publicly was deeply offensive to Southern Congressmen, and violated the long-held sectional understanding between free and slave state legislators.\n\nMissouri statehood confronted Southern Jeffersonians with the prospect of applying the egalitarian principles espoused by the Revolutionary generation. This would require halting the spread of slavery westward, and confine the institution to where it already existed. Faced with a population of 1.5 million slaves, and the lucrative production of cotton, the South would abandon hopes for containment. Slaveholders in the 16th Congress, in an effort to come to grips with this paradox, would resort to a theory that called for extending slavery geographically so as to encourage its decline: \"diffusion\".\n\nOn February 16, 1819, the House Committee of the Whole voted to link Tallmadge's provisions with the Missouri enabling legislation, approving the move 79-67. Following the committee vote, debates resumed over the merits of each of Tallmadge's provisions in the enabling act. The debates in the House's 2nd session in 1819 lasted only three days. They have been characterized as \"rancorous\", \"fiery\", \"bitter\", \"blistering\", \"furious\" and \"bloodthirsty\".\n\nNorthern representatives outnumbered the South in House membership 105 to 81. When each of the restrictionist provisions were put to the vote, they passed along sectional lines: 87 to 76 in favor of prohibition on further slave migration into Missouri (Table 1) and 82 to 78 in favor of emancipating slave offspring at age twenty-five.\nThe enabling bill was passed to the Senate, where both parts of it were rejected: 22 to 16 opposed to restricting new slaves in Missouri (supported by five northerners, two of whom were the proslavery legislators from the free state of Illinois); and 31 to 7 against gradual emancipation for slave children born post-statehood. House antislavery restrictionists refused to concur with the Senate proslavery anti-restrictionists: Missouri statehood would devolve upon the 16th Congress in December 1819.\n\nThe Missouri Compromise debates stirred suspicions among proslavery interests that the underlying purpose of the Tallmadge amendments had little to do with opposition to slavery expansion.\nThe accusation was first leveled in the House by the Republican anti-restrictionist John Holmes from the District of Maine. He suggested that Senator Rufus King's \"warm\" support for the Tallmadge amendment concealed a conspiracy to organize a new antislavery party in the North – a party composed of old Federalists in combination with disaffected antislavery Republicans. The fact that King, in the Senate, and Tallmadge and Tyler, in the House – all New Yorkers – were among the vanguard for slavery restriction in Missouri lent credibility to these charges. When King was re-elected to the US Senate in January 1820, during the 16th Congress debates, and with bipartisan support, suspicions deepened and would persist throughout the crisis. Southern Jeffersonian Republican leadership, including President Monroe and former President Thomas Jefferson, considered it as an article of faith that Federalists, given the chance, would destabilize the Union so as to re-impose monarchal rule in North America, and \"consolidate\" political control over the people by expanding the functions of the central government. Jefferson, at first unperturbed by the Missouri question, soon became convinced that a northern conspiracy was afoot, with Federalists and crypto-Federalists posing as Republicans, using Missouri statehood as a pretext.\n\nDue to the disarray of the Republican Ascendency brought about by amalgamation, fears abounded among Southerners that a Free State party might take shape in the event that Congress failed to reach an understanding over Missouri and slavery: Such a party would threaten Southern preeminence. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts surmised that the political configuration for just such a sectional party already existed.\nThat the Federalists were anxious to regain a measure of political participation in national politics is indisputable. There was no basis, however, for the charge that Federalists had directed Tallmadge in his antislavery measures, nor was there anything to indicate that a New York-based King-Clinton alliance sought to erect an antislavery party on the ruins of the Republican Party. The allegations by Southern proslavery interests of a \"plot\" or that of \"consolidation\" as a threat to the Union misapprehended the forces at work in the Missouri crisis: the core of the opposition to slavery in the Louisiana Purchase were informed by Jeffersonian egalitarian principles, not a Federalist resurgence.\n\nTo balance the number of \"slave states\" and \"free states\", the northern region of what was then Massachusetts, the District of Maine, ultimately gained admission into the United States as a free state to become Maine. This only occurred as a result of a compromise involving slavery in Missouri, and in the federal territories of the American West.\nThe admission of another slave state would increase the South's power at a time when northern politicians had already begun to regret the Constitution's Three-Fifths Compromise. Although more than 60 percent of whites in the United States lived in the North, by 1818 northern representatives held only a slim majority of congressional seats. The additional political representation allotted to the South as a result of the Three-Fifths Compromise gave southerners more seats in the House of Representatives than they would have had if the number was based on just free population. Moreover, since each state had two Senate seats, Missouri's admission as a slave state would result in more southern than northern senators. A bill to enable the people of the Missouri Territory to draft a constitution and form a government preliminary to admission into the Union came before the House of Representatives in Committee of the Whole, on February 13, 1819. James Tallmadge of New York offered an amendment, named the Tallmadge Amendment, that forbade further introduction of slaves into Missouri, and mandated that all children of slave parents born in the state after its admission should be free at the age of 25. The committee adopted the measure and incorporated it into the bill as finally passed on February 17, 1819, by the house. The United States Senate refused to concur with the amendment, and the whole measure was lost.\n\nDuring the following session (1819–1820), the House passed a similar bill with an amendment, introduced on January 26, 1820, by John W. Taylor of New York, allowing Missouri into the union as a slave state. The question had been complicated by the admission in December of Alabama, a slave state, making the number of slave and free states equal. In addition, there was a bill in passage through the House (January 3, 1820) to admit Maine as a free state.\n\nThe Senate decided to connect the two measures. It passed a bill for the admission of Maine with an amendment enabling the people of Missouri to form a state constitution. Before the bill was returned to the House, a second amendment was adopted on the motion of Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois, excluding slavery from the Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36°30′ north (the southern boundary of Missouri), except within the limits of the proposed state of Missouri.\n\nThe vote in the Senate was 24 for the compromise, to 20 against. The amendment and the bill passed in the Senate on February 17 and February 18, 1820. The House then approved the Senate compromise amendment, on a vote of 90 to 87, with those 87 votes coming from free state representatives opposed to slavery in the new state of Missouri. The House then approved the whole bill, 134 to 42, with opposition from the southern states.\n\nThe two houses were at odds not only on the issue of the legality of slavery but also on the parliamentary question of the inclusion of Maine and Missouri within the same bill. The committee recommended the enactment of two laws, one for the admission of Maine, the other an enabling act for Missouri. They recommended against having restrictions on slavery but for including the Thomas amendment. Both houses agreed, and the measures were passed on March 5, 1820, and were signed by President James Monroe on March 6.\n\nThe question of the final admission of Missouri came up during the session of 1820–1821. The struggle was revived over a clause in Missouri's new constitution (written in 1820) requiring the exclusion of \"free negroes and mulattoes\" from the state. Through the influence of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay \"The Great Compromiser\", an act of admission was finally passed, upon the condition that the exclusionary clause of the Missouri constitution should \"never be construed to authorize the passage of any law\" impairing the privileges and immunities of any U.S. citizen. This deliberately ambiguous provision is sometimes known as the Second Missouri Compromise.\n\nDuring the decades following 1820, Americans hailed the 1820 agreement as an essential compromise almost on the sacred level of the Constitution itself. Although the Civil War broke out in 1861, historians often say the Compromise helped postpone the war.\n\nThese disputes involved the competition between the southern and northern states for power in Congress and for control over future territories. There were also the same factions emerging as the Democratic-Republican party began to lose its coherence. In an April 22 letter to John Holmes, Thomas Jefferson wrote that the division of the country created by the Compromise Line would eventually lead to the destruction of the Union:\n\nThe debate over admission of Missouri also raised the issue of sectional balance, for the country was equally divided between slave and free states with eleven each. To admit Missouri as a slave state would tip the balance in the Senate (made up of two senators per state) in favor of the slave states. For this reason, northern states wanted Maine admitted as a free state. Maine was admitted in 1820 and Missouri in 1821, but no further states were added until 1836, when Arkansas was admitted.\n\nFrom the constitutional standpoint, the Compromise of 1820 was important as the example of Congressional exclusion of slavery from U.S. territory acquired since the Northwest Ordinance. Nevertheless, the Compromise was deeply disappointing to African-Americans in both the North and South, as it stopped the southern progression of gradual emancipation at Missouri's southern border and legitimized slavery as a southern institution.\n\nThe provisions of the Missouri Compromise forbidding slavery in the former Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36°30′ north were effectively repealed by Stephen A. Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854. The repeal of the Compromise caused outrage in the North and sparked the return to politics of Abraham Lincoln, who criticized slavery and excoriated Douglas's act in his \"Peoria Speech\" (October 16, 1854).\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7743069", "categories": ["1820 in American politics", "Legal history of Missouri", "16th United States Congress", "History of United States expansionism", "United States federal territory and statehood legislation", "1820 in law", "Slavery in the United States", "Presidency of James Monroe", "Missouri in the American Civil War"], "title": "Missouri Compromise"}

Within a couple of months, the civilians were moved out and prisoners from the invasion of Poland arrived. From May 1940, after the invasion of Norway and the Battle of France, prisoners arrived in large numbers, until they totalled 150,000 from all occupied countries, except Britain. British prisoners were held in separate camps all over Germany. Part of the facilities were used as Oflag XIII-A for officers.\n\nIn August 1940 most enlisted men were shipped to other camps; Stalag XIII-A, Stalag XIII-B and Stalag XIII-C. Only those remained who were already employed in local industry and were housed in individual Arbeitskommandos.\n\nIn June 1941 the massive influx of Soviet prisoners from Operation Barbarossa began. In August 1943 the camp was severely damaged during an Allied air-raid. 23 wooden huts were burnt down. Miraculously only two Soviet prisoners were killed in the camp. However, in this and subsequent bombing attacks, many prisoners were killed in individual Arbeitskommandos. In late 1944/early 1945 the camp population grew enormously with the arrival of prisoners evacuated from camps in the east in front of the advance of the Red Army. These included many Americans and British airmen from Stalag Luft III.\nOn 12 April 1945 large numbers were marched to Stalag VII-A, and on 16 April the camp was liberated by advance elements of the United States Army.\n\nAfter the war, former SS military personnel were held in Stalag XIII-D.

His brothers were Tokugawa Satotaka and Tokugawa Takachiyo, who also held the Tayasu headship at different times. Iesato was also briefly the \"daimyō\" of the short-lived Shizuoka Domain, before the abolition of the han system in the early 1870s. His guardian at the time was Matsudaira Naritami, the former lord of the Tsuyama Domain. He was an adopted son of the fourteenth shogun, Tokugawa Iemochi and his wife, Kazu-no-Miya Chikako or Seikan'in no Miya (although Iesato was Iemochi's adopted son they only met once. Later Iemochi's foster mother, Tenshō-in, raised Iesato). In 1866 he was sent to Edo Castle as Iemochi's son and was raised by Tenshō-in and Kazu-no-Miya Chikako. In 1868 he was sent to Kyoto by his mother, Kazu-no-Miya Chikako and met with Emperor Meiji. He married the daughter of Konoe Tadafusa, Konoe Hiroko, who bore him Iemasa Tokugawa, the seventeenth Tokugawa family head, Yasuko Tokugawa, who married Nobusuke Takatsukasa and bore him Toshimichi Takatsukasa, Ryōko Tokugawa, and Toshiko Tokugawa.\n\nIn 1877, Iesato was sent to Eton College in Great Britain to study. He returned to Japan in 1882, and was given the title of \"kōshaku\" (公爵, prince) under the \"kazoku\" peerage system. He became a member of the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan from its creation in 1890, and served as President of the House of Peers from 1901-1933. When the administration of Prime Minister Yamamoto Gonnohyōe was brought down by the Siemens scandal, there was a strong movement to have Tokugawa Iesato nominated to be his successor.\n\nFollowing World War I, Iesato served on the Japanese delegation to the Washington Naval Conference. His support of the United States position on the 10:10:6 division of naval strength between the United States, Great Britain and Japan drew considerable wrath from the ultra-rightist movements and conservative factions within the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\nIesato is remembered for having recovered the political fortunes and reputation of the Tokugawa family, holding many senior government positions before his retirement, including In 1928, being appointed as the 7th President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, head of the Japan-America Society, and President of the national organizing committee for the 1940 Olympics.\n\nIesato is quoted as once having said about his adoptive father: \"Yoshinobu destroyed the Tokugawa house; I rebuilt it.\"\n\nHis grave is at the Tokugawa family cemetery at the temple of Kan'ei-ji in Ueno, Tokyo.

The Gaelic name is Port Neasaig.\n\nPort Nessock Bay is now all that remains of the western end of a strait that in post-glacial times separated the main part of what is now the Rinns of Galloway from three smaller islands to its south. There was a ruined pier in the bay in 1790, at which time kelp and samphire were gathered on the coast to the south.\n\nThe village was planned; it was created by Colonel Andrew MacDowall (Douall), the laird of Logan, in 1818. MacDowall erected a quay and bell tower designed by Thomas Telford, and a causewayed road leading to them. This causeway blocked the view to seaward of the existing houses on the Lower Road (Laigh Row), whose inhabitants MacDowall expected to move to a new Upper Road; in the event, they welcomed the shelter it provided from the brisk onshore winds, and preferred to stay put, though subsequently most of them added a second storey so recovering some of the sea view.\n\nFacilities include a village hall which used to be the local Lifeboat Station. It is run by a local committee and completely self-funding. In recent years it has been used for a range of social events such as weddings and to celebrate Hogmanay and St Andrew's Night. It is sometimes used for meetings of the Kirkmaiden Community Council. There is a tiny part-time post office. There is a small market garden supplying local businesses and the public. \n\nFor a couple of years until 2006 they also included a newly built cafe with excellent views called the Butterchurn; however, this was then closed, and converted into a private house.\n\nThe Logan Fish Pond, Logan Botanic Garden & Logan House Garden are nearby. Logan Fish Pond was also built by Colonel Andrew McDouall, originally as a fish larder for Logan House, circa 1788 and completed around 1800, with a Keeper's Cottage and Bathing Hut which still stand as part of the modern Logan Fishpond Marine Life Centre. 2016, the Fishpond - the oldest natural marine aquarium in the UK, if not the world - is still a tourist attraction, opened again under new management. The story of Logan Fishpond can be found at the website of Historic Scotland.\n\nThe village was used between 2001 and 2003 as the setting for a popular BBC series, Two Thousand Acres of Sky starring actress Michelle Collins.\n\n2017 saw the filming of \"The Vanishing\" starring Gerard Butler, Peter Mullan and newcomer Connor Swindells.\n\nOn 27 July 1944, two Douglas C-47 Skytrains (one was serial number 42-93038) of the United States Army Air Forces were on a flight from Filton to a stop at Prestwick before flying on to the United States. The flight was transporting wounded soldiers. The flight encountered bad weather, and the pilot of 42-93038 tried to gain altitude to clear the cliffs. The C-47 crashed into the cliff side at Port Logan, where all 22 passengers and crew died.\n", "id": "7743261", "categories": ["Villages in Dumfries and Galloway"], "title": "Port Logan"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7743369", "text": "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\n\nThe phrase \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" is a generic name used in the United Kingdom for a person, usually with strongly conservative political views, who writes letters to newspapers or the BBC in a tone of moral outrage. \"Disgusted\" is the pseudonym of the supposed letter writer, who is a resident of the stereotypically middle-class town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in the south-east of England. The term may have originated either with the 1944 BBC radio programme \"Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh\", a regular writer to \"The Times\" or with an editor of the letters page of a local newspaper, the \"Tunbridge Wells Advertiser\".\n\nIn later times, the term has continued to be used to describe conservative letter writers who complain to newspapers about a subject that they morally or personally disagree with. It is often used in relation to news stories regarding Royal Tunbridge Wells. Some residents of the town have criticised the term as obsolete, but several continue to embrace it.\n\nA \"stuffy, reactionary image\" was associated with the town of Tunbridge Wells by the novelist E. M. Forster in his 1908 book \"A Room with a View\", in which the character Charlotte Bartlett says, \"I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times\". Tunbridge Wells was later granted a royal charter by King Edward VII in 1909 and renamed \"Royal Tunbridge Wells\".\n\nThe BBC radio show \"Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh\", first broadcast in 1944, is sometimes stated in newspaper reports to have popularised the term \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" for correspondence to newspapers. There were also suggestions that the use of \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" came from one regular contributor of letters to \"The Times\" in the early 20th century, who would use a particular style of writing to oppose people and organisations who came to his attention. Despite being described as the \"quintessential Englishman\" because of his writing style and having his letters regularly published, his identity was never known because he would only identify himself as \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\". However, some reports have popularly rumoured that this person was a retired colonel who served in the British Indian Army during the British Raj. In 2014, the \"Kent and Sussex Courier\" claimed that the originator of \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" was the retired British Army colonel George Thomas Howe, who had developed a skill for letter writing about apartheid after five years in the Union of South Africa. Reportedly, his letters were popular reading and helped to sell newspapers that published them.\n\nAccording to the Royal Tunbridge Wells historian and former newspaper editor Frank Chapman, the phrase has a different origin, starting in the 1950s with the staff of the former \"Tunbridge Wells Advertiser\". During the paper's final months of publication, the editor Nigel Chapman, alarmed at a lack of letters from readers, insisted his staff write a few to fill space. One signed his simply \"Disgusted, Tunbridge Wells\", which was then adopted by all future staff letters until the \"Tunbridge Wells Advertiser\" ceased publication in 1954. The term \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" was later used to stereotype Royal Tunbridge Wells as being a town of retired British Army colonels who would write such letters to newspapers.\n\nExamples of letters of this type sent to the \"Advertiser\" may be found which pre-date these origins, such as:\n\nThe type of letters written with a tone of incensed moral outrage have become commonly described as \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" letters, even though the writer may not be from Royal Tunbridge Wells. For example, the actor Michael Caine once said: \"I don't want to sound like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, but I do think there should be some sort of national service for young men\". People writing them have been claimed by commentators to be readers of the \"Daily Mail\", despite the original letters not originating in that publication.\n\nThe magazine \"Private Eye\" made regular use of the \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" pseudonym to satirise the stereotypical conservative Middle Englander, and it became a running joke for several years. In 1978, BBC Radio 4 called its new listener feedback programme \"Disgusted, Tunbridge Wells\", though it was renamed \"Feedback\" in 1979. This was following Radio 4 broadcasting the \"Take It From Here\" radio series in 1954 where \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" was prominently featured. In politics, the people behind \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" letters have strong conservative views and are commonly viewed to support the Conservative Party. However, most UK Independence Party (UKIP) members in the party's early days were viewed by commentators as being \"'Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells' pensioners\", of which the UKIP leader Nigel Farage stated in 2013 \"... the people in it [UKIP] and who voted for it were in the main 'Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells'. I mean, you look down the membership list in 1994, anyone below a half colonel was a nobody...\"\n\nIn 1980, the BBC Radio 2 broadcaster Terry Wogan chaired an \"It's Your BBC\" meeting at Royal Tunbridge Wells' Assembly Hall Theatre. A report in \"The Times\" suggested the BBC had staged the meeting in the town in the hope that \"Disgusted\" would reveal himself.\n\nIn 2006, the author and magistrate Connie St Louis singled out the \"disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" stereotype as a powerful British middle-class movement, saying \"they are part of the group with the same concerns, so they have a sense of belonging\".\n\nIn 2013, Nigel Cawthorne published \"Outraged of Tunbridge Wells\", a compilation of letters to the \"Tunbridge Wells Advertiser\" that were viewed as being in the style of \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" from the British Library archives. Critical review of the book has stated that the \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" style displayed an art of letter writing that has continued despite other things in the world changing.\n\nResidents of Royal Tunbridge Wells have also expressed displeasure in a manner similar to the \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" stereotype in relation to the Waitrose supermarket chain refusing to open a store in the town while neighbouring \"downmarket\" towns of Tonbridge and Crowborough both did have one.\n\nIn 2016, during the United Kingdom referendum on the British membership in the European Union, \"The New York Times\" used Royal Tunbridge Wells as its base for reporting on the referendum. The town was chosen because it was seen as the \"quintessentially English town\" due to the \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" phrase. Although most Americans would not fully understand the reference, the town was nonetheless considered a symbol of middle England. The town is a Conservative stronghold and was the only council area in Kent to vote by a majority for Remain during Brexit.\n\nIn 2009, some residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells called the tag \"inappropriate\" and \"stereotypical\", and asked the town to drop association with it in favour of \"Delighted of Tunbridge Wells\". However, there was opposition to this campaign by other residents, some of whom wrote to newspapers in the \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" style arguing they preferred \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\". Local merchants at the town's information centre pointed out that tourists were buying twice as many goods bearing \"Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells\" than with \"Delighted of Tunbridge Wells\".\n\n\n", "id": "7743369", "categories": ["Stereotypes of the middle class", "Royal Tunbridge Wells", "Conservatism in the United Kingdom", "English culture", "Letter writers", "English phrases", "Class-related slurs"], "title": "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells"}

Nature photographer Galen Rowell declared it \"the most influential environmental photograph ever taken\". This had been preceded by the crude 1966 black-and-white raster image taken by the Lunar Orbiter 1 robotic probe, the first American spacecraft to orbit the Moon.\n\n\"Earthrise\" is the name popularly given to NASA image AS08-14-2383, taken by astronaut William Anders during the Apollo 8 mission, the first manned voyage to orbit the Moon.\n\nInitially, before Anders found a suitable 70 mm color film, mission commander Frank Borman said he took a black-and-white photograph of the scene, with the Earth's terminator touching the horizon (AS08-13-2329). The land mass position and cloud patterns in this image are the same as those of the color photograph entitled \"Earthrise\".\n\nThe photograph was taken from lunar orbit on December 24, 1968, 16:00 UTC, with a highly modified Hasselblad 500 EL with an electric drive. The camera had a simple sighting ring rather than the standard reflex viewfinder and was loaded with a 70 mm film magazine containing custom Ektachrome film developed by Kodak. Immediately prior, Anders had been photographing the lunar surface with a 250 mm lens; the lens was subsequently used for the \"Earthrise\" images. An audio recording of the event is available with transcription which allows the event to be followed closely – excerpt:\n\nThere were many images taken at that point. The mission audio tape establishes several photographs were taken, on Borman's orders, with the enthusiastic concurrence of Jim Lovell and Anders. Anders took the first color shot, then Lovell who notes the setting (1/250th of a second at ), followed by Anders with another very similar shot (AS08-14-2384).\n\nA nearly full-page black and white reproduction of Borman's image may be viewed on page 164 of his 1988 autobiography, captioned, \"One of the most famous pictures in photographic history – taken after I grabbed the camera away from Bill Anders\". Borman was the mission commander and notes that this is the image \"the Postal Service used on a stamp, and few photographs have been more frequently reproduced\". The photograph reproduced in the Frank Borman autobiography is not the same image as the Anders photograph; aside from the orientation, the cloud patterns differ. Borman later recanted this story and agreed that the black and white shot was also taken by Anders, based on evidence presented by transcript and a video produced by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio employee, Ernie Wright.\n\nThe stamp issue reproduces the cloud, color, and crater patterns of the Anders picture. Anders is described by Borman as holding \"a masters degree in nuclear engineering\"; Anders was thus tasked as \"the scientific crew member ... also performing the photography duties that would be so important to the Apollo crew who actually landed on the Moon\".\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 8 mission in 2018, Anders described in an interview how the image undermined his religious belief: \"It really undercut my religious beliefs. The idea that things rotate around the pope and up there is a big supercomputer wondering whether Billy was a good boy yesterday? It doesn't make any sense. I became a big buddy of [atheist scientist] Richard Dawkins.\"\n\nThe as-published photograph shows Earth:\n\nIn \"Life\"s \"100 Photographs that Changed the World\", wilderness photographer Galen Rowell called \"Earthrise\" \"the most influential environmental photograph ever taken\". Another author called its appearance the beginning of the environmental movement. Fifty years to the day after taking the photo, William Anders observed, \"We set out to explore the moon and instead discovered the Earth.\"\n\nIn October 2018, the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) of the International Astronomical Union named one of the large craters seen in the photo \"Anders' Earthrise\". The crater had previously been designated only with letters.\n\nIn 1969, the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp (Scott# 1371) commemorating the Apollo 8 flight around the Moon. The stamp featured a detail (in color) of the \"Earthrise\" photograph, and the words, \"In the beginning God...\", recalling the Apollo 8 Genesis reading.\n\nOn April 6, 2008 (Japan Standard Time), the first 1080p high-definition Earthrise video was captured, both a full Earthrise and Earthset video, by the JAXA lunar orbiter mission, SELENE (better known in Japan by its nickname \"Kaguya\"). After successfully orbiting the Moon for 1 year and 8 months, it was crashed intentionally onto the lunar surface at 18:25 UTC on June 10, 2009.\n\nIn 2013, in commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 8 mission, NASA issued a video about the taking of the photograph. This computer-generated visualization used data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, which had provided detailed images of the lunar surface that could be matched with those taken every 20 seconds by an automatic camera on Apollo 8. The resulting video, re-creating what the astronauts would have seen, was synchronized with the recording of the crew's conversation as they became the first humans to witness an Earthrise. The video included explanatory narration written and read by Andrew Chaikin. Chaikin writes that all the photographs of the rising Earth on Apollo 8's fourth orbit were taken by Anders.\n\nThe Earth \"rose\" because the spacecraft was traveling over the Moon's surface. An earthrise that might be witnessed from the \"surface\" of the Moon would be quite unlike moonrises on Earth. Because the Moon is tidally locked with the Earth, one side of the Moon always faces toward Earth. Interpretation of this fact would lead one to believe that the Earth's position is fixed on the lunar sky and no earthrises can occur; however, the Moon librates slightly, which causes the Earth to draw a Lissajous figure on the sky. This figure fits inside a rectangle 15°48' wide and 13°20' high (in angular dimensions), while the angular diameter of the Earth as seen from Moon is only about 2°. This means that earthrises are visible near the edge of the Earth-observable surface of the Moon (about 20% of the surface). Since a full libration cycle takes about 27 days, earthrises are very slow, and it takes about 48 hours for Earth to clear its diameter. During the course of the month-long lunar orbit, an observer would additionally witness a succession of \"Earth phases\", much like the lunar phases seen from Earth. That is what accounts for the half-illuminated globe seen in the photograph.\n\n\n", "id": "7743380", "categories": ["Photographs of Earth from outer space", "Apollo program", "1968 in the environment", "1968 in spaceflight", "1968 in art", "Apollo 8", "Articles containing video clips", "1968 photographs", "History of environmentalism"], "title": "Earthrise"}

Under Penn Central operation it continued through South-Western Ontario (Canada) to Buffalo, New York. Amtrak retained two trains (the other was the renamed \"St. Clair\") and truncated the operation to Detroit but otherwise changed little. In April 1975, Amtrak introduced French-built Turboliner equipment to the Michigan route and added a third round-trip. A pool of three Turboliner trainsets served the route, and the three round-trip pairs were numbered 350—355, train numbers which are still in use today. Amtrak dropped the individual train names and rebranded all three \"Turboliner\", in common with similar services to St. Louis, Missouri and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The new equipment led to massive gains in ridership, topping 340,000 in 1975 and 370,000 in 1976.\n\nThe Turboliners became a victim of their own success. Although fast (and flashy), they were unable to reach their design speed of because of the poor quality of the Penn Central track in Michigan. The five-car fixed consists had a maximum capacity of 292 passengers, which was often not enough. Starting in March 1976 Amtrak began replacing some of the Turboliners with conventional equipment, including new Amfleet coaches. Individual names returned to the corridor, with the heretofore unnamed third train becoming the \"Twilight Limited\". The last Turboliners left the corridor in 1981.\n\nAmtrak extended the \"Wolverine\" and \"Twilight Limited\" to Pontiac on May 5, 1994. With this change service began at a new station in Detroit's New Center. Although the Michigan Central Station in Corktown, Detroit had closed on January 6, 1988, trains continued to stop at a temporary platform just east of the old station. Besides Pontiac, new stations were opened at Royal Oak and Troy. The \"Lake Cities\" also began serving Pontiac after the end of Toledo service in 1995.\n\nAmtrak dropped individual names again in 2004 and named all three trains \"Wolverine\".\n\nDue to the increased ridership on these trains, Amtrak tested an additional Chicago-Kalamazoo \"Wolverine\" frequency September 2 to September 7, 2010. This was done to determine all that would be involved in operations should Amtrak decide to initiate such service in the future.\n\nThe federal government considers high-speed rail service to be rail service which at any time reaches the speed of or higher. In 2006 the Detroit–Chicago corridor was designated by the Federal Railroad Administration as a high-speed rail corridor and in October 2010, the State of Michigan received US$150 million from the federal government to increase track speeds to between Kalamazoo and Dearborn. In 2016, work to allow higher-speed operation on 41 miles of track between Battle Creek and Jackson, including \"...replacing 26,000 railroad ties, repairing or installing 15 track switches, realigning or modifying 29 railroad curves, repairing 23 railroad grade crossings and improving road profiles at crossings\", was completed. \n\nAmtrak owns the stretch of the \"Wolverine's\" route from Porter, Indiana to Kalamazoo, Michigan and it is the longest segment of track owned by Amtrak outside of the Northeast Corridor. Starting in January 2002 Amtrak began track improvements to increase the allowed speed along this section of track. Amtrak trains currently travel at top speeds of along this section of track. \n\nIn December 2012, MDOT completed its purchase from Norfolk Southern of of track between Kalamazoo and Dearborn. This will make it easier to maintain track and eventually upgrade it to running by late 2017. As part of the purchase agreement, MDOT also agreed to double-track the line east of Ypsilanti.\n\nThe \"Wolverine\" operates over Norfolk Southern Railway, Amtrak, and Canadian National Railway trackage:\n\n, each \"Wolverine\" operates with two General Electric Genesis P42DC locomotives, 3-5 Horizon coaches, and an Amfleet cafe/business class car. In the winter, Superliners are sometimes used. The equipment pool for the Wolverines comprises 14 Horizon coaches and 3.5 Amfleet cafe/business class cars (one is shared with the \"Blue Water\"), split across three consists. The locomotives usually operate in a push-pull configuration, however sometimes both will be at the head end. Due to the FRA requirement of positive train control for operations above 79 mph, locomotives on the \"Wolverine\" are required to have Positive Train Control, supplied by Amtrak's Incremental Train Control System. Because of this modification the units equipped with PTC are usually captive to the Michigan services.\n\nBetween 2016-2018 Michigan expected to take delivery of new bilevel cars which will displace the Horizons and Amfleets in regular service. In addition, in early 2014 the Michigan Department of Transportation issued a request for proposal aimed at acquiring additional passenger equipment for use between 2014-2017. However, due to the failure of a critical crash test by the bilevel manufacturer, the order was switched to new single-level cars built by Siemens that are similar to the Virgin Trains USA fleet. \n\nIn September 2014, the state of Michigan reached an agreement with Talgo, a Spanish railcar manufacturer, to buy two trainsets for the \"Wolverine\", at a cost of $58 million. The trains had been previously built for the state of Wisconsin, before plans for expanded passenger rail service in that state were canceled and the trainsets placed in storage. The new equipment will provide a substantial upgrade in passenger amenities over the Amtrak-owned railcars used on the route. Despite this proposal, the Talgo railcars remain at the Amtrak facility in Beech Grove. \n\nMichigan was also involved in a joint purchase with other states to purchase the new Siemens Charger locomotives.\n\n\n", "id": "7743396", "categories": ["Amtrak routes", "West Michigan", "Passenger rail transportation in Illinois", "Passenger rail transportation in Indiana", "Passenger rail transportation in Michigan", "Higher-speed rail", "Central Michigan"], "title": "Wolverine (train)"}

It is demersal in nature and inhabits the upper continental slope at a depth of . A small, slender species growing no longer than , the northern sawtail catshark is characterized by a series of dark, narrow saddles along its back and tail, and rows of prominently enlarged dermal denticles along the upper edge of its caudal fin and the underside of its caudal peduncle. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough information to assess its conservation status.\n\nThe first known specimens of the northern sawtail catshark were collected during exploratory surveys conducted off northeastern Australia in the 1980s, and provisionally termed \"Galeus\" sp. B. It was formally described by Daniel Gledhill, Peter Last, and William White in a 2008 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) publication, in which they also resurrected the genus \"Figaro\", until then considered a junior synonym of \"Galeus\". The specific epithet \"striatus\" means \"striped\" in Latin. The type specimen is a long adult male caught south of the Saumarez Reefs, Queensland, on November 17, 1985.\n\nThe range of the northern sawtail catshark is limited to the upper continental slope off Queensland, between Rockhampton and Townsville. It is found on or near the bottom at a depth of .\n\nReaching in length, the northern sawtail catshark has a firm, thin body with a mostly cylindrical cross-section. The head is short, narrow, and flattened, with a bluntly pointed snout. The eyes are horizontally oval and equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids); beneath each is a narrow ridge, and behind is a tiny spiracle. The anterior rims of the nostrils are enlarged into triangular, outward-pointing flaps. The mouth is large and arched, with short but prominent furrows around each corner. There are around 65 upper and 61–65 lower tooth rows; each tooth has a narrow central cusp flanked by 3–5 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits; the fourth and fifth are located over the pectoral fin bases and closer together than the others.\n\nThe small dorsal fins have blunt apexes and straight to gently convex trailing margins; the first is slightly taller but shorter-based than the second. The origin of the first and second dorsal fins lie over the rear of the pelvic fins and anal fin respectively. The pectoral fins are small and broad, with rounded corners. The pelvic fins are long and low; adult males have slender claspers and a slight \"apron\" formed from the fusion of the pelvic fin inner margins. The anal fin is elongated, its base measuring roughly a tenth of the total length, and rather angular. The length of the anal fin base exceeds the distance between the anal and pelvic fins, and is comparable to the distance between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin is short and low, with a small lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The body and fins are entirely covered by minute, overlapping dermal denticles; each has an ovoid crown with a horizontal ridge leading to a marginal cusp. There are distinctive crests of enlarged, spiny denticles along the anterior half of the caudal fin upper margin, and beneath the caudal peduncle. This species is light grayish brown on the back of the body and tail, with a series of dark brown saddles numbering 10–16 before the dorsal fins, of which a few are wider than the others. The flanks, underside, and fins are whitish.\n\nLittle is known of the natural history of the northern sawtail catshark. Males attain sexual maturity at approximately long.\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature has noted that there is minimal fishing activity within the northern sawtail catshark's range, but presently lacks sufficient information to assess it beyond Data Deficient.\n", "id": "7743402", "categories": ["Figaro", "Fauna of Queensland"], "title": "Northern sawtail catshark"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7743448", "text": "Diel vertical migration\n\nDiel vertical migration (DVM), also known as diurnal vertical migration, is a pattern of movement used by some organisms, such as copepods, living in the ocean and in lakes. The migration occurs when organisms move up to the epipelagic zone at night and return to the mesopelagic zone of the oceans or to the hypolimnion zone of lakes during the day. The word \"diel\" comes from the Latin \"dies\" day, and means a 24-hour period. In terms of biomass, it is the greatest migration in the world. It is not restricted to any one taxa as examples are known from crustaceans (copepods), molluscs (squid), and ray-finned fishes (trout). Various stimuli are responsible for this phenomenon, the most prominent being response to changes in light intensity, though evidence suggests that biological clocks are an underlying stimulus as well. The phenomenon may arise for a number of reasons, though it is most typically to access food and avoid predators. While this mass migration is generally nocturnal, with the animals ascending from the depths at nightfall and descending at sunrise, the timing can be altered in response to the different cues and stimuli that trigger it. Some unusual events impact vertical migration: DVM is absent during the midnight sun in Arctic regions and vertical migration can occur suddenly during a solar eclipse.\n\nDuring World War II the U.S. Navy was taking sonar readings of the ocean when they discovered the deep scattering layer (DSL). While performing sound propagation experiments the University of California's Division of War Research (UCDWR), consistently had results of the echo-sounder that showed a distinct reverberation that they attributed to mid-water layer scattering agents, there was speculation these readings may be attributed to enemy submarines. By collaborating with biologists from Scripps Institution and the UCDWR, they were able to confirm that the observed reverberations from the echo-sounder were in fact related to the diel vertical migration of marine animals. The DSL was caused by large, dense groupings of organisms, like zooplankton, that scattered the sonar to create a false or second bottom. \n\nOnce scientists started to do more research on what was causing the DSL, it was discovered that a large range of organisms were vertically migrating. Most types of plankton and some types of nekton have exhibited some type of vertical migration, although it is not always diel. These migrations may have substantial effects on mesopredators and apex predators by modulating the concentration and accessibility of their prey (e.g., impacts on the foraging behavior of pinnipeds).\n\n\nThere are two different factors that are known to play a role in vertical migration, endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous factors originate from the organism itself; sex, age, biological rhythms, etc. Exogenous factors are environmental factors acting on the organism such as light, gravity, oxygen, temperature, predator-prey interactions, etc.\n\nEndogenous rhythm\n\nBiological clocks are an ancient and adaptive sense of time innate to an organism that allows them to anticipate environmental changes and cycles so they are able to physiologically and behaviorally respond to the expected change. Evidence of circadian rhythms controlling DVM, metabolism, and even gene expression have been found in copepod species, \"Calanus finmarchicus\". These copepods were shown to continue to exhibit these daily rhythms of vertical migration in the laboratory setting even in constant darkness, after being captured from an actively migrating wild population. An experiment was done at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography which kept organisms in column tanks with light/dark cycles. A few days later the light was changed to a constant low light and the organisms still displayed diel vertical migration. Thus suggestions that some type of internal response was causing the migration.\n\nClock gene expression\n\nMany organisms including the copepod \"C. finmarchicus\", has genetic material devoted to maintaining its biological clock. The expression of these genes varies temporally with the expression significantly increasing following dawn and dusk at times of greatest vertical migration seen in this species. These finding may indicate they work as a molecular stimulus for vertical migration.\n\nBody size\n\nThe relative body size of an organism has been found to effect DVM. Bull trout express daily and seasonal vertical migrations with smaller individuals always staying at a deeper layer than the larger individuals. This is most likely due to a predation risk but is dependent on the individuals own size such that smaller animals may be more inclined to remain at depth.\n\nLight\n\nLight is the most common and critical cue for vertical migration. Organisms want to find an optimum light intensity (isolume). Whether it is no light or a large amount of light, an organism will travel to where it is most comfortable. Studies have shown that during a full moon organisms will not migrate up as far or during an eclipse they will start to migrate.\n\nTemperature\n\nOrganisms will migrate to a water depth with suitable temperatures that best suit the organisms needs, for example some fish species migrate to warmer surface waters in order to aid digestion. Temperature changes can influence swimming behavior of some copepods. In the presence of a strong thermocline some zooplankton may be inclined to pass through it, and migrate to the surface waters, though this can be very variable even in a single species. The marine copepod, \"Calanus finmarchicus,\" will migrate through gradients with temperature differences of 6 °C over George's Ban\"k;\" whereas, in the North Sea they are observed to remain below the gradient.\n\nSalinity\n\nChanges in salinity may promote organism to seek out more suitable waters if they happen to be stenohaline or unequipped to handle regulating their osmotic pressure. Areas that are impacted by tidal cycles accompanied by salinity changes, estuaries for example, may see vertical migration in some species of zooplankton. In areas such as the Arctic, melting ice causes a layer of freshwater which organisms cannot cross.\n\nPressure\n\nPressure changes have been found to produce differential responses that result in vertical migration. many zooplankton will react to increased pressure with positive phototaxis, a negative geotaxis, and/or a kinetic response that results in ascending in the water column. Likewise, when there is a decrease in pressure, the zoo plankton respond by passively sinking or active downward swimming to descend in the water column.\n\nPredator kairomones\n\nA predator might release a chemical cue which could cause its prey to vertically migrate away. This may stimulate the prey to vertically migrate to avoid said predator. The introduction of a potential predator species, like a fish, to the habitat of diel vertical migrating zooplankton has been shown to influence the distribution patterns seen in their migration. For example, a study used \"Daphnia\" and a fish that was too small to prey of them (\"Lebistus reticulatus\"), found that with the introduction of the fish to the system the \"Daphnia\" remained below the thermocline, where the fish was not present. This demonstrates the effects of kairomones on \"Daphnia\" DVM\".\"\n\nTidal Patterns\n\nSome organisms have been found to move with the tidal cycle. A study looked at the abundance of a species of small shrimp, \"Acetes sibogae,\" and found that they tended to move further higher in the water column and in higher numbers during flood tides than during ebb tides experiences at the mouth of an estuary. It is possible that varying factors with the tides may be the true trigger for the migration rather than the movement of the water itself, like the salinity or minute pressure changes.\n\nThere are many hypotheses as to why organisms would vertically migrate, and several may be valid at any given time. \nWater transparency\n\nA recent theory of DVM, termed the Transparency Regulator Hypothesis, argues that water transparency is the ultimate variable that determines the exogenous factor (or combination of factors) that causes DVM behavior in a given environment. In less transparent waters, where fish are present and more food is available, fish tend to be the main driver of DVM. In more transparent bodies of water, where fish are less numerous and food quality improves in deeper waters, UV light can travel farther, thus functioning as the main driver of DVM in such cases.\n\nDue to the particular types of stimuli and cues used to initiate vertical migration, anomalies can change the pattern drastically.\n\nFor example, the occurrence of midnight sun in the Arctic induces changes to planktonic life that would normally perform DVM with a 24-hour night and day cycle. In the summers of the Arctic the Earth's north pole is directed toward the sun creating longer days and at the high latitude continuous day light for more than 24-hours. Species of foraminifera found in the ocean cease their DVM pattern, and rather remain at the surface in favor of feeding on the phytoplankton, for example \"Neogloboquadrina pachyderma\", and for those species that contain symbionts, like \"Turborotalita quinqueloba\", remain in sunlight to aid photosynthesis.\n\nThere is also evidence of changes to vertical migration patterns during solar eclipse events. In the moments that the sun is obscured during normal day light hours, there is a sudden dramatic decrease in light intensity. The decreased light intensity, replicates the typical lighting experienced at night time that stimulate the planktonic organisms to migrate. During an eclipse, some copepod species distribution is concentrated near the surface, for example \"Calanus finmarchicus\" displays a classic diurnal migration pattern but on a much shorter time scale during an eclipse.\n\nThe biological pump is the conversion of CO and inorganic nutrients by plant photosynthesis into particulate organic matter in the euphotic zone and transference to the deeper ocean. This is a major process in the ocean and without vertical migration it wouldn't be nearly as efficient. The deep ocean gets most of its nutrients from the higher water column when they sink down in the form of marine snow. This is made up of dead or dying animals and microbes, fecal matter, sand and other inorganic material.\n\nOrganisms migrate up to feed at night so when they migrate back to depth during the day they defecate large sinking fecal pellets. Whilst some larger fecal pellets can sink quite fast, the speed that organisms move back to depth is still faster. At night organisms are in the top 100 metres of the water column, but during the day they move down to between 800–1000 meters. If organisms were to defecate at the surface it would take the fecal pellets days to reach the depth that they reach in a matter of hours. Therefore, by releasing fecal pellets at depth they have almost 1000 metres less to travel to get to the deep ocean. This is something known as active transport. The organisms are playing a more active role in moving organic matter down to depths. Because a large majority of the deep sea, especially marine microbes, depends on nutrients falling down, the quicker they can reach the ocean floor the better.\n\nZooplankton and salps play a large role in the active transport of fecal pellets. 15–50% of zooplankton biomass is estimated to migrate, accounting for the transport of 5–45% of particulate organic nitrogen to depth. Salps are large gelatinous plankton that can vertically migrate 800 meters and eat large amounts of food at the surface. They have a very long gut retention time, so fecal pellets usually are released at maximum depth. Salps are also known for having some of the largest fecal pellets. Because of this they have a very fast sinking rate, small detritus particles are known to aggregate on them. This makes them sink that much faster. So while currently there is still much research being done on why organisms vertically migrate, it is clear that vertical migration plays a large role in the active transport of dissolved organic matter to depth.\n\n", "id": "7743448", "categories": ["Marine biology", "Biological oceanography", "Aquatic ecology", "Planktology"], "title": "Diel vertical migration"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7743530", "text": "Prostitution in France\n\nProstitution in France (the exchange of sexual acts for money) was legal until April 2016, but several surrounding activities were illegal, like operating a brothel, living off the avails (pimping), and paying for sex with someone under the age of 18 (the age of consent for sex is 15).\n\nOn 6 April 2016, the French National Assembly voted to punish customers of prostitutes by a fine of €1500.\n\nIn the Napoleonic era, France became the model for the regulatory approach to prostitution. In the 20th century, however, a policy shift became apparent. Brothels became illegal in 1946, and France signed the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others in 1960. France thus became a major supporter of the international abolitionist movement for the eradication of prostitution (see Abolitionism in France).\n\nThe history of prostitution in France is similar to that in other European countries, with alternating periods of tolerance and repression (\"Tolérance générale, répression occasionnelle\"), but is marked by the length of time during which the \"maisons\" (brothels) were tolerated. Prostitutes were not marginalized, but integrated into society where they had a role to play. In stories (which were often ribald), prostitutes would be complicit with other women in avenging men. The great Cathedral of Chartres had a window endowed by prostitutes (The Prodigal Son) in the same way as other windows were endowed by various other trade guilds (The Trade Windows).\n\nAfter the period of Roman rule, the Visigoth monarch Alaric II (485-507 AD) seems to be the first French ruler to prosecute prostitution.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the various authorities, civil or noble, oversaw prostitution as an institution. Regulation was largely at the municipal level, restricting activity on certain streets, travel, liaisons, required distinctive dress (gold belts, or \"ceinture dorée\")\nand opening hours of the \"maisons\" (10-6, or 10-8 in Paris).\n\nCharlemagne (768-814 AD) was amongst those rulers who attempted to suppress prostitution, declaring flogging (300 lashes) as a punishment in his capitularies. This was primarily aimed at the common man, since harems and concubines were common amongst the ruling classes. Some idea of the seriousness with which the state regarded the offense is provided by the fact that 300 lashes was the severest sentence prescribed by the Code Alaric. Offenders also had their hair cut off, and in the case of recidivism, could be sold as slaves. There is no evidence that any of this was effective.\nUnder Philip II (1180-1223) an irregular militia, the \"\" were created in 1189 to police prostitution and gambling, headed by a \"Roi des Ribauds\", but abolished by Philip IV (1285-1314) due to their licentiousness.\n\nIn the interim, Louis IX (1226-1270) attempted to ban prostitution in December 1254, with disastrous social consequences and widespread protests. The decree ordered the expulsion of all \"women of evil life\" from the kingdom and confiscation of their belongings, but simply drove the trade underground. Eventually he was forced to revoke this by 1256. Although still railing against women who were \"free with their bodies and other common harlots\", he acknowledged the pragmatic desirability of housing them away from respectable streets and religious establishments, and so obliged them to reside outside of the borders of the city walls. His resolve to do away with prostitution was affirmed in a letter of 1269 to the regents, as he set out on the Eighth Crusade, in which he refers to the need to extirpate the evil, root and branch. The punishment for infraction was an 8 sous fine and risking imprisonment in the Châtelet (see below). He designated nine streets in which prostitution would be allowed in Paris, three of them being in the sarcastically named Beaubourg quartier (Beautiful Neighbourhood) (Rue de la Huchette, Rue Froimon, Rue du Renard-Saint-Merri, Rue Taille pain, Rue Brisemiches, Rue Champ-Fleury, Rue Trace-putain, \nRue Gratte-cul, and the Rue Tire-Putain) (see below)\n\nToday, this area corresponds to the 1st-4th arrondissements clustered on the Rive Droite (right bank) of the Seine (see map). These streets, associated with prostitution, had very evocative if indelicate names including the \"Rue du Poil-au-con\" (or hair of the \"con\", from the Latin \"cunnus\" meaning female genitalia, hence Street of the Pubic Hair, or Poil du pubis), later altered to the Rue du Pélican, in the 1st arrondissement, near the first Porte Saint-Honoré, and the \"Rue Tire-Vit\" (Pull-Cock, i.e. penis, later the \"Rue Tire-Boudin\", Pull-Sausage) now Rue Marie-Stuart, in the 2nd arrondissement, near the first Porte Saint-Denis. It is said that \"Tire-Boudin\" was a euphemism invented for Mary Queen of Scots when she asked after its name, and the street is now named after her. The nearby \"Rue Gratte-Cul\" (Scratch-bottom) is now the Rue Dussoubs, and the \"Rue Pute-y-Musse\" (Whore [who] hides there) the Rue du Petit-Musc by corruption. The \"rue Trousse-Nonnain\" (fuck nun), later became Trace-Putain, Tasse-Nonnain, and Transnonain; then in 1851 it was amalgamated into the Rue Beaubourg. The \"Rue Baille-Hoë\" (Give Joy) is now Rue Taillepain in the 4th arondissement near the Porte Saint-Merri.\n\nIn 1358, the Grand Conseil of John II (1350-1364) echoing the \"necessary evil\" doctrine of Saints Augustine (354-430 AD) and Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) declared that \"les pécheresses sont absolument nécessaires à la Terre\" (Sinners are an absolute necessity for the country). Prostitution remained confined to designated areas, as indicated in this decree in the reign of Charles V (1364-1380), by Hugh Aubriot, Provost of Paris in 1367, outlining the areas outside of which prostitutes would be punished 'according to the ordinance of Saint Louis';\n\"Que toutes les femmes prostituées, tenant bordel en la ville de Paris, allassent demeurer et tenir leurs bordels en places et lieux publics à ce ordonnés et accoutumés, selon l'ordonnance de Saint Louis. C'est à savoir : à L'Abreuvoir de Mascon (à l'angle du pont Saint-Michel et de la rue de la Huchette), en La Boucherie (voisine de la rue de la Huchette), rue Froidmentel, près du clos Brunel (à l'est du Collège de France aboutissant au carrefour du Puits-Certain), en Glatigny (rue nommée Val d'Amour dans la Cité), en la Court-Robert de Pris (rue du Renard-Saint-Merri), en Baille-Hoë (près de l'église Saint-Merri et communiquant avec la rue Taille-Pain et à la rue Brise-Miche), en Tyron (rue entre la rue Saint-Antoine et du roi de Sicile), en la rue Chapon (aboutissant rue du Temple) et en Champ-Flory (rue Champ-Fleury, près du Louvre). Si les femmes publiques, d'écris ensuite cette ordonnance, se permettent d'habiter des rues ou quartiers autres que ceux ci-dessus désignés, elles seront emprisonnées au Châtelet puis bannies de Paris. Et les sergents, pour salaire, prendront sur leurs biens huit sous parisis…\" \n\nContemporary accounts suggest that this decree was rarely enforced.\n\nThe appearance of syphilis at the end of the 15th century had stigmatized these houses by the end of the 16th century, but their continued existence was confirmed by King Henry IV (1589-1610).\n\nIn 1804 Napoleon ordered the registration and bi-weekly health inspection of all prostitutes. State controlled legal brothels (then known as \"\"maisons de tolérance\"\" or \"\"maisons closes\"\") started to appear in Paris and in other cities and became highly popular throughout the century. By 1810, Paris alone had 180 officially approved brothels.\n\nBy law, they had to be run by a woman (typically a former prostitute) and their external appearance had to be discreet. Prostitutes working in the \"maisons\", or any woman arrested twice for soliciting had to be registered as such. Registration involved having their name on a national register, and agreeing to abide by the regulations and twice weekly medical examinations.\nThis pattern of regulation rapidly spread throughout Europe, partly aided by the Napoleonic occupations.\n\nAmong the most expensive and best known \"maisons de tolérance\" in Paris were:\n\nMore sordid brothels, the \"maisons d'abattage\", offering quick and dirty \"services\", were popular amongst the lower-class.\n\nThe 19th century was also the time of several fabulously rich courtesans in Paris, with La Païva being the most famous one.\n\nDuring World War I, in Paris alone, US Army officials estimated that there were 40 major brothels, 5,000 professionally licensed streetwalkers, and another 70,000 unlicensed prostitutes. By 1917, there were at least 137 such establishments across 35 towns on or close to the Western front.\n\nThe British Army adopted local codes of ethics when fighting in another country, and so allowed troops on rest periods and days off to visit what became termed \"maisons tolérées\". Such activity was not just tolerated but encouraged for both the young, as well as the married men who were missing their wives. As the war advanced, so did the need and rank of the prostitutes entertained. While British troops paid just six pence per day were often found in the lowest priced institutes, dominion soldiers from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada received six shillings and could afford higher-class \"services\". British officers preferred to \"\"always indulge with armour (condoms)\"\" and took to patronizing German Army officers' former prostitutes when the lines of conflict were advancing towards the end of the war, with the advantage that they sometimes gained tactical and strategic information as well.\n\nIt is unknown how many or what percentage of men visited the institutions, but the French army recorded over a million cases of gonorrhea and syphilis during the war. In 1915, in Le Havre, a survey undertaken by the Royal Army Medical Corps counted 171,000 uniformed British Army visitors to the brothels in just one street. As a result, rates of venereal disease began to climb, with 23,000 British Army men at any time on average during the second half of the campaign hospitalized for treatment, with over 150,000 British soldiers having been infected by the end of the war. The disease at the time had a high social stigma, but a particularly bad infection could get a soldier medically discharged from frontline duty, even on a temporary basis. Syphilis was treated with injections of mercury, administered at a hospital over a 30-day period, thereby guaranteeing escape from the frontline. The result was that some prostitutes with particularly bad VD infections could charge more. Every British army unit had a sexually transmitted disease clinic, where soldiers could gain an ointment consisting of mercury and chlorine to prevent VD infection, or receive a urethral irrigation with potassium permanganate after STI exposure.\n\nThe US Army attitude was different, driven by a reformist attitude at home. In October 1917, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker said:\n\nAided by the American Social Hygiene Organization, he closed so called segregated zones close to Army training camps, which included closing the notorious Storyville district in New Orleans. When the two million soldiers of the American Expeditionary Force had been deployed to France, they were guided by a bulletin from AEF commander Gen. John Pershing to just say no:\n\nThis was backed up by additional posters and pamphlets that read \"You wouldn't use another fellow's tooth-brush, so why use his whore?\" and \"A Soldier Who Gets a Dose Is a Traitor!\" The US Army had clear instructions on those who did not follow the no indulgence rule. US Army regulations required soldiers who admitted to having sex while on leave to submit to chemical prophylaxis, that included irrigating the penis. Soldiers who did not report for prophylaxis and later contracted VD were subject to court-martial and possibly a hard-labor sentence, while those who contracted disease after treatment only lost pay during treatment. Implemented from the first day of training, the initiative was so successful that US Army doctors reported that 96% of the cases they treated had been contracted while the soldier was still a civilian.\n\nHowever, on debarkation at the designated port of St. Nazaire, a dispute with French authorities broke out, after the AEF placed the \"Maisons Tolérée\" off limits. With the dispute escalating, President Georges Clemenceau sent a memo to Gen. Pershing offering a compromise: American medical authorities would control designated brothels operated solely for American soldiers. Pershing passed the proposal to Raymond Fosdick, who gave it to Secretary Baker. Upon receiving it, Baker responded: \"For God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the president or he'll stop the war.\" The French later proposed a deal that targeted the Black American troops, most of whom were assigned to unloading freight in segregated stevedore battalions, again flatly turned down by US authorities. But this merely highlighted US differential racial policy, as all black troops were required by US Army regulations to undertake prophylaxis when returning from leave, whether or not they acknowledged sexual contact.\n\nThe policy adopted by the US Army worked, with far lower rates of VD across their troops compared to French or British and Dominion combatants. However, after the signing of the Armistice, when the US Army could no longer plead military necessity as grounds for curtailing leave, VD rates among US Army troops shot up.\n\nDuring World War II, Dr Edith Sumerskill raised the issue of \"Maisons Tolérées\" in Parliament to Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden after the intervention of the British Expeditionary Force. Further questions were raised in Parliament after the D-Day invasion, to ensure such local practises and medical precautions were continued.\n\nDuring the German occupation of France, twenty top Paris \"maisons\", including le Chabanais, le Sphinx and le One-Two-Two, were reserved by the Wehrmacht for German officers and collaborating Frenchmen.\nThe brothels flourished during this time, and Hermann Göring visited \"Le Chabanais\", as is related in the 2009 two-volume book \"1940-1945 Années Erotiques\" by Patrick Buisson.\n\nAfter the war, Marthe Richard, a town councillor in Paris and former street prostitute, successfully campaigned for the closure of all \"maisons\". On 13 April 1946, the \"loi de Marthe Richard\" was passed with votes of the Christian-Democratic Party (MRP) and the Communist Party (PCF). The latter considered brothels to be \"bourgeois\". As a result, the legal brothels were closed. (This serves as a plot point in the first James Bond novel, \"Casino Royale\".) However, prostitution remained a legal activity, with only its organization and \"exploitation\" (pimping) forbidden.\n\nThis ended a system in existence since 1804, which effectively made prostitutes less visible without suppressing the trade, and thus preservied \"public morality\". Prostitute registries were supposed to be destroyed, but police kept files till 1960. Roughly 20,000 women were affected by this law, and approximately 1,400 houses were closed. Many former brothel owners soon opened \"hôtels de passe\" instead, where prostitutes could keep on working, but the visibility of their activities was reduced.\n\nCritics of French prostitution policy, such as Mouvement du Nid, question how effective this was, its implementation, and whether it really closed the \"maisons\". For instance, they point to the presence of military brothels in Algeria till 1960.\n\nIn 1958, the \"Office central pour la répression de la traite des êtres humains\" (OCRTEH) was created as a branch of the police, to combat pimping and cooperate with Interpol. It is under the direction of the Minister of the Interior.\n\nFrance became officially \"abolitionist\" in 1960 when it ratified the 1949 UN Convention on the Suppression of Trafficking and the Exploitation of Prostitution.\n\nIn the debates over prostitution in France, \"abolition\" was used to refer to both the abolition of laws and regulations that make any distinction between someone involved in prostitution and the general population, and the abolition of prostitution itself. At that time, police files on prostitutes were finally destroyed.\nHowever, implementation varied considerably locally, although prostitution was rarely on the political agenda over the next 30 years. Exceptions were the demonstrations of prostitutes rights movements against police harassment in 1975, and periodic calls by individual politicians for re-opening the \"maisons\" (see \"Maisons closes\" below).\nThese included that of (RPR), a former Minister of health (1986-1988) in 1990, as a public health measure, given the concerns about HIV/AIDS.\n\nState policy has been built on two principles - criminalization, and support. Criminalization of the exploitation (brothels, procuring, pimping) of prostitution, and support and re-integration for those exiting. However, the latter attracted few funds, and was largely left to charitable NGOs. Only a single position within the Department of Social Services had responsibility for this part of policy and funding.\nThe original intention was that the Departments would set up their own Prevention and Rehabilitation Services, but of 100, only 12 were created following the 1960 ordinance, and by 1999, there were only 5, run by NGOs.\nOther state responsibilities have fallen to the women's rights administration,\nand also to health, finance, interior, foreign, and education ministries from time to time.\n\nIn the new Penal Code, pimping became a serious offence if associated with organized crime or barbarity, and overall was defined at three levels of severity with increasing fines, and prison sentences from five years up to life imprisonment. Clients were only criminalized if purchasing from minors under 15 years of age.\n\nIn 1998, sex tourism was added if offences against minors were committed by French residents outside France.\n\nIn the 1990s, France became increasingly assertive internationally as a champion of abolitionism, opposing moves towards liberalization and regulation by the Netherlands and the International Labour Organization.\nFrance also opposed the distinction between 'free' and 'forced' prostitution in international discussions. Hubert Védrine the foreign minister asserted France's position at various international venues, such as the protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale and prostitution of children and child pornography (2000) and the Convention on organized crime with the protocol on trafficking (Palermo 2000). French policy emphasised, along with the International Convention, that the real evil was prostitution, not trafficking, defined as an \"accompanying evil\". At the same time, Nicole Péry, minister for women's rights (\"Secrétaire d'État aux droits des femmes\"; 1998-2002), included prostitution in her department's campaign on violence against women, calling it a form of violence at Beijing+5, (New York 2000).\n\nActive solicitation was also outlawed in the late 1940s. Passive solicitation (being present with revealing clothes at locations known for prostitution) was outlawed in 2003 as part of a package of law-and-order measures by then-interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, in his \"Domestic Security Bill\" (loi pour la sécurité intérieure 2003, or LSI also known as Loi Sarkozy II), and had the effect of reducing the visibility of prostitution on the streets.\nProstitutes' organizations decried the measure, which came into force in March 2003, calling it punitive and fated to increase the power of pimps. Many prostitutes started to work out of vans, a strategy authorities attempted to combat by using parking regulation enforcement.\n\nLaw number 2016-444 \"visant à renforcer la lutte contre le système prostitutionnel et à accompagner les personnes prostituées\" (\"Eng.: \"to strengthen the fight against the prostitution system and to support prostituted persons\"\") was enacted on 6 April 2016, with effect from 13 April 2016.\n\nThe most publicised provision of this law is that the buying of sexual acts was made illegal and punishable with a fine of up to €3,750. However, the bulk of this law is concerned with supporting prostitutes exiting the industry and supporting victims of sex trafficking.\n\nIn the first six months after the law was enacted, 249 men were prosecuted for purchasing sexual acts.\n\nIt is legal for a man or woman to be a prostitute and sell sexual acts. The buying of sexual acts was outlawed in April 2016.\n\"Racolage\" (soliciting), including \"racolage passif\" (passive soliciting) is prohibited. This is defined as standing in a public place known for prostitution, dressed in revealing attire, and is punishable by up to six months in prison and a fine of €3750.\nOwning or operating a brothel is illegal.\n\nAll forms of \"proxénétisme\" (procuring) are illegal. \n\"Proxénétisme\" is defined as:\n\nFrance is an \"abolitionist\" country - its public policy is the prohibition and eradication of prostitution; however, at the same time, it considers that making it illegal to offer sexual acts in return for goods or services in the context of one's private life is a violation of individual liberty.\n\nThe issue has been prominent on the French political agenda since the late 1990s, responding to international pressures on child prostitution and pornography and trafficking, international distinctions between forced and voluntary entry into prostitution (rejected by the dominant \"abolitionist\" discourse) and increasing migration. This has been accompanied by increasing discourse on \"la sécurité\" internally, which has gradually become dominant, affecting the framework in which prostitution is debated. This was heightened in 2002 when Jean-Pierre Raffarin's right-wing government (2002-2005) succeeded the \"Gauche Plurielle\" (plural left) coalition of Lionel Jospin (1997-2002). The Jospin construction was that prostitutes were victims and needed to be saved and re-integrated. This was a view shared by state feminists, ministers, delegates, and the powerful abolitionist lobby, and is reflected in the Derycke report as well as the National Commission on Violence Against Women, \nas well as the debates on modern slavery (\"esclavage moderne\").\nThese consultations in turn enabled agents of the civil society access to the policy process. Very few of these constructed prostitution as a legitimate form of work.\n\nAt the municipal level, there was evidence of prostitutes being constructed as public nuisances that needed to be confined, and many mayors of both political groups responded to citizen groups to introduce by-laws restricting prostitutes' activities in early 2002. This was fuelled by an apparent increased visibility. For instance, Françoise de Panafieu (UMP delegate 17th arondissement) campaigned against street prostitution in the summer of 2002. The commitment to abolitionism prevented specific laws aimed at prostitution (which would have been seen as regulation) initially, so they often used traffic and parking by-laws to drive out workers, which ultimately mean that they were moved from well-lit busy areas to much more unsafe areas. As the discourse shifted from abolitionism to security, so did more explicit laws and regulations. This disquiet enabled Nicolas Sarkozy to later mobilize public anxiety about security evident in the elections that year in his Domestic Security bill.\n\nThe cultural context is the concept of gender equality as stated in the preamble to the 1946 and 1958 constitution and which had seen an increasing momentum of political gains for women, including the establishment of a women's policy agency in 1974 and a ministry of women's rights in 1981. However, a significant gap still exists in terms of economic and employment opportunities. Meanwhile, immigration policies have become increasingly restrictive, and soliciting can result in the removal of a migrant's work permit.\n\nThe 2007 Socialist Party Manifesto calls for holding clients \"responsible\". The vague language is due to the fact that such measures remain controversial in the Socialist Party.\nThe Manifesto also calls for repealing the ban on \"passive solicitation\".\n\nIn 2010, Chantal Brunel, an MP in Sarkozy's ruling right-wing UMP party, and newly appointed head of the equality office, \ncalled for legalizing and regulating \"maisons closes\" (brothels), (see Maisons closes, below) akin to the situation in several surrounding countries, claiming that this would make the sex trade safer and transparent. She outlined the strategy in her 2010 book \"Pour en finir avec les violences faites aux femmes\" (\"An end to violence against women\"). This caused considerable discussion. French prostitutes are opposed to this plan to legalize and regulate \"maisons\", arguing that it would limit their options to make their own decisions—dozens of French prostitutes have marched to protest the proposal to legalize brothels. Instead, they demand the repeal of the 2003 law outlawing solication,\na demand that Chantal Brunel also supports.\n\nIn June 2012, the socialist women's minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem announced that she wanted to abolish prostitution in France and in Europe.\n\nState feminists dominated the discourse in the left-wing Jospin years, pursuing an anti-male-violence campaign. As Women's Minister, Nicole Péry, confirmed in her New York speech (see above), prostitution, as a form of male violence, was very much part of that State strategy.\n\nThis influence has waned under the security agenda of the succeeding right-wing governments, but is still evident in the new political thinking, as stated in Marie-Jo Zimmermann's (UMP) 2002 report to the Delegation on Women's Rights on prostitution\nin which she echoes the left wing sentiment that the purchase of sex constitutes violence. The pervasiveness of this thinking is even found in the budget.\n\nAs in many other countries, debates on the nature and regulation of transactional sex are highly polarized. These positions are the familiar ones that define sex work as violence against women on the one hand, and those who see the problem as stigmatisation and poor working conditions on the other. These result in proposals for either the eradication of prostitution, or social reforms. The dominant abolitionist faction consists of Catholics, family values advocates and sections within feminism and the left. As elsewhere, the term \"abolitionism\" has seen a shift from the abolition of Réglementation to include abolition of sexual slavery.\n\nFrom the abolition of \"Réglementation\" and the \"maisons closes\" (1946) to the late 1990s, there was a broad abolitionist consensus. This resulted from a close fit between the government position and the dominant socio-political discourse, making it acceptable to a broad coalition that included abolitionists, secular and religious NGOs, politicians from both ends of the political spectrum, and most French feminists. This was so dominant under the Jospin years as to appear normative and non-ideological\nand above any philosophical debate.\nThis provides abolitionists access to both the policy process and to resources, such as the 2000 UNESCO conference (see below), which had high-profile support, including important left-wing figures such as Jean-Pierre Chevènement and Sylviane Agacinski, who was also married to Lionel Jospin.\n\nIn the 1990s, a number of changes shifted the focus of debates. These included an increasing globalization of movements on both parts of the debate, Sweden and the Netherlands were moving to change their legislation in two distinct and different directions, there was political instability in Eastern Europe and there was also increasing concern about AIDS, while state feminists were also playing an increasing part in policy debates. There were however occasional dissenting voices such as the debate in Le Nouvel Observateur in 1999, sparked by the Dutch legislation.\n\nA manifestation of abolitionism was the declaration of May 18, 2000, published in the centre-left \"Le Nouvel Observateur\", called \"\"Le corps n'est pas une marchandise\"\" (\"The body is not a commodity\"). This was signed by 35 prominent citizens, and demanded that France and Europe affirm their commitment to the abolition of prostitution, resulting in a debate covering many aspects of the subject, such as choice, autonomy, voice, and agency. Signatories included Francois Hollande, Robert Hue, Dominique Voynet, Isabelle Alonso, Boris Cyrulnik, Françoise Héritier, and Antoinette Fouque.\nThat same week, the Minister of Labour, Martine Aubry, proclaimed in the Assemblée nationale that France would continue to defend its abolitionist position against prostitution, because the commodification of human bodies was not acceptable and a violation of human rights.\n\nUNESCO held a conference in Paris on May 16 of that year (\"Peuple de l'Abîme. La Prostitution aujourd'hui\")\norganized by (Fondation Scelles),\nan abolitionist NGO, which also published \"Le livre noir de la prostitution\", a strongly worded attack on the subject of prostitution.\n\nIn 1999, 189 cases of pimping were tried, and 137 sentenced to prison. Generally the judiciary were satisfied with the existing legislation,\nalthough 2000 also saw the creation of a new unit of the Judicial Police using information technology to combat pimping and trafficking. Transnational operators proved a problem to the police.\n\nState feminism culminated in the Senate's new \"Délégation Aux Droits Des Femmes\" (Delegation for Women's Rights)\ninitiating an inquiry in 1999. The 2001 report of the Delegation (named after its author, Senator Dinah Derycke (1997-2001))\nwas critical of what it saw as the lack of commitment in the fight against prostitution, mainly the difference between France's official abolitionist position and what was occurring in practice. Although the report received a favourable reception in parliament initially, its political impact was limited. Senator Derycke retired due to ill health and died soon after, while other pressures diverted the debate into other related measures, such as organized crime and trafficking and 'modern slavery'. Outside parliament, there was a new activism and demand for action, led by \"Bus des femmes\".\nBut the focus of the outcry was trafficking, with an emphasis on Eastern Europe. However, the new right-wing government elected in 2002 (Jean-Pierre Raffarin) was to completely change the way prostitution was perceived (see below).\n\nCriticism of the dominant discourse came from prostitute' rights advocates, health associations, such as Cabiria (Lyons),\nAIDS groups, and some activists who complained that sex workers were being treated paternalistically and denied voice and moral agency. They demanded eradication of stigma and restoration of rights, access to health and social services, and better \"working conditions\". Organizations such as Cabiria, ,\n, and AIDES-Paris Isle-de-France condemned the UNESCO conference (above) as stigmatizing.\n\nAll parties claimed they spoke on behalf of and for sex workers, and shared a concern for their welfare, while denying their opponents did.\nTherefore, both sides held a position that workers should not be penalized, positioned as either victims or legitimate workers.\n\nNew issues arising in 2002 were local residents' complaints and the ascendacy of a law and order discourse on both left and right, leading to a heated debate, notably the suggestion by Françoise de Panafieu (UMP) that the (see Maisons closes below) be re-opened.\nThe issue of \"security\" became a major issue in the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2002. The catch-cry of \"to save the Republic\" worked in the favour of the right and President Jacques Chirac and Jean-Pierre Raffarin who came to power as Prime Minister that year.\nNicolas Sarkozy became minister of the interior in the incoming right-wing Rafferin government (2002-2005), almost immediately announcing a \"Domestic Security Bill\" (),\nand the focus of the debates around prostitution shifted to legislation. (see Public opinion 2002, below)\n\nIn justifying these measures, Sarkozy claimed large segments of the population were exposed to \"anxiety and legitimate exasperation\". Article 42 addressed the protection of women in prostitution, considered victims of exploitation, and these were amplified by the Minister for Equality in the Workplace, Nicole Ameline (2002-2004). \nSarkozy stated that by criminalizing passive soliciting, he was protecting prostitutes and helping them escape organized crime.\nThe Government position was that action against certain activities would improve the quality of life and sense of security of the poor, who are likely to be victims of crime. Sarkozy stated that the poor supported a tough crime agenda and that the general population wanted a stronger stand on law and order. In particular, he cited an Ipsos poll suggesting that 80% of people on minimum wage approved of his proposals and that the lower the socio-economic class the more support.\nIn February 2002, a poll suggested security was the most important issue on people's minds in an election year, and in October, 70% of the population considered the proposed measures necessary.\n\nThe Sarkozy bill both redefined prostitution and transformed policy, making solicitation, previously a minor offence, a serious offence (un délit) (up to six months imprisonment initially, but amended to two), with stiffer fines, and brought back \"passive\" solicitation as a crime (Article 50). Passive solicitation had been previously decriminalized by another right-wing government, that of Balladur in 1994.\n\nProposed Article 225-10-1 removed the necessity of the police having evidence of soliciting, allowing 'dress or posture' to be sufficient. He explained that it was inconvenient for the police to have to obtain evidence of active soliciting. In the Senate, a Government amendment subsequently deleted reference to dress after a popular outcry.\nArticle 50 also criminalized purchase of sex from those considered 'particularly vulnerable', such as 'illness, disability, physical or mental deficiency or pregnancy'.\n\nFurthermore, the new legislation allowed for foreigners to have their permits revoked for disturbing public order, allowing deportation to become a penalty for solicitation (active or passive), even if they were legal immigrants. It addressed trafficking, by defining it and attached penalties. In the case of alleged victims of trafficking, collaboration allowed them to stay and work till their case was heard. If an exploiters were convicted (Article 76), they could then receive permanent residence. Finally, article 52 allowed for annual reports to be published on prostitution in France, from 2004 onwards.\n\nReactions included demonstrations and petitions.\nCriticism came from the left, trade unions, women's\nand human rights and poverty groups who saw this bill, which simultaneously addressed begging, squatting and assembling in public areas of buildings,\nas an attack on the poor, stating that no one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute.\nSarkozy was accused of exploiting people's insecurities. In the Senate, the measures were seen to be street cleaning, rather than addressing the causes of social problems and social exclusion, and that reconstructing prostitution as a law and order issue would merely drive it underground, depriving sex workers from access to services, and damaging AIDS campaigns. it was stated that no-one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute, to live in neighbourhoods with no facilities and no public services\". It was noted that there was no action to deal with organized crime or those who might be exploiting sex workers.\n\nThe issue of passive solicitation caused particular concern since it could mean that any woman could be arrested for the way she dressed, and it was particularly hard to define. The judiciary were equally unhappy with evidence that solely consisted of police testimony and were reluctant to convict.\nIt was suggested that concern for victims for trafficking was hardly consistent with punishing them, and that prostitution had become conflated with trafficking. The trafficking policy seemed more aimed at the porousness of borders than at actual criminals, while migrant sex workers appeared to be particularly discriminated against, since they were simultaneously 'rescued' and deported without in any way addressing their vulnerability. Calls for aiming trafficking policy at traffickers rather than sex workers came from the Senate Law Commission, the Delegations for Women's Rights in the Senate and National Assembly, as well as from the opposition.\n\nIn the Senate hearings into prostitution that year, Claude Boucher of \"Bus des Femmes\", a sex worker support group, described how sex workers sell sex to survive, unable to make ends meet on social security or the minimum wage. To treat them as criminals, she argued, would just make them more vulnerable. \"\"Cette loi n'est même pas une loi d'ordre moral, c'est une loi contre les exclus, contre les plus vulnérables\"\" (This law is not even a public morals law, it is a law against those who are excluded, against the most vulnerable)\n\nSarkozy did not attempt to produce a comprehensive policy on prostitution, but rather a quick fix, addressing immediate concerns of voters in terms of visibility.\nIn this, he succeeded, at least in the short term. The police reported a 40% decrease in prevalence, but also that it had moved to more discreet areas and hours.\nHowever, the more profound effect was that Sarkozy had changed the framing of sex workers from victims to criminals, and tied it to immigration debates, focusing narrowly on street transactions. This avoided inconveniencing the middle-class clients, who might have created more opposition. The governmental policy tended to portray all immigrant women in prostitution, the most vulnerable, as victims of trafficking and exploitation, and their pimps as \"foreigners\".\n\nFollowing the law coming into effect, 5,619 charges of passive solicitation were laid between March 2003 and July 2004, 90% of these were women, and most from Bulgaria and Albania (40%), Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Cameroon (35%). 15% were French nationals, another 10% from other areas in Africa and 2% from Asia. \nThere was a notable increase in foreign workers detained and deported. In 2004, the police dismantled many trafficking networks, mainly involving Eastern Europe and Africa.\n\nWhile the law referred to protection, shelter, and re-integration, there was no provision made for this, according to Cimade, an NGO.\nThe results of the law were considered disastrous for the women who were supposed to be protected. The effects were largely those of displacement, pushing their activities into isolated areas, and the 3-7am timeslot, isolated them from service agencies, exposed them to violence and destroyed the historical working relationship with the police.\nA study by Anne Hidalgo and Christophe Caresche, Deputy mayors in the office of the Mayor of Paris (Bertrand Delanoë),\nwas especially critical:\n\n«\"En amalgamant prostitution libre et prostitution forcée, qui relèvent de processus totalement différents, en victimisant les personnes qui se prostituent, sans distinction, cette loi légitime et renforce les violences symboliques, physiques, policières, institutionnelles. Elle renforce aussi leur insécurité, les obligeant à investir des lieux éloignés des regards, d'autant plus qu'elle les contraint à travailler davantage puisque toutes ont vu leur clientèle se raréfier, et par conséquent leur revenu diminuer de 50 % en moyenne\"»\n\nSarkozy had made a sharp distinction between the \"classic prostitution\" of the traditional French Fille de Joie, who he depicted as unproblematic, even a cultural icon (see Culture), and the presence of \"\"ces malheureuses filles étrangères\"\" (these poor foreign girls) on the streets of France, who he depicted as the security threat. By \"rescuing\" these victims of trafficking and returning them home, he proposed to solve the situation. He argued that the only way to achieve this was to arrest them and then send them back to their families (\"Si le racolage est reconnu comme un délit, les forces de l'ordre pourront, parce qu'elles auront commis un délit, ramener ces filles chez elles\"), which he stated to be a humanitarian duty \"\"c'est un devoir, dirai-je, humanitaire que de raccompagner cette personne chez elle\"\" (I will say it is a humanitarian duty to return such a person to their home).\n\n\"\"Far be it for me to suggest punishing these poor girls: The offense that we are creating must come to their aid ... I hope that these women will have a better future than facing degrading encounters night after night\"\"\n\nIn drawing this distinction, Sarkozy made frequent reference to the inability to speak French, constructing the issue as a defense of French. He suggested that this made them vulnerable to exploitation, and that the Police would take them home. This last point became a target of those who believed they were being sent back to the conditions that made them leave in the first place.\n\nChanges to trafficking policy in 2003 were more influenced by European and international influence than domestic concerns, but trafficking was finally defined as well as giving victims residence permits in exchange for testimony. Critics doubted the practicality or whether the benefits were equally distributed between the women and the authorities, an expression of the tension between human rights and public security.\n\nIn April 2006, Senator Nicole Borvo (PCF) attempted to introduce a private bill to repeal the Sarkozy law, arguing that it had been ineffective, and turned victims into criminals. The framework was very similar to the 2001 Deryck report, depicting prostitution as violence rather than law and order, and seeking punishment of exploiters, but also measures for prevention and support.\nIn April 2011, a parliamentary commission report (\"En finir avec le mythe du plus vieux métier du monde\") recommended the adoption of the Swedish approach of criminalizing the purchase of sex.\nThe social affairs minister, Roselyne Bachelot, supported the proposal, stating, \"There is no such thing as freely chosen and consenting prostitution. The sale of sexual acts means women's bodies are made available for men, independently of the wishes of those women.\" Other support came from .\nThe French sex worker movement STRASS has condemned the proposals.\nIn October and November 2013, French lawmakers began debating a proposal to punish customers of prostitution. On December 4, the National Assembly passed a bill fining customers of prostitutes by 268 votes to 138, with 79 abstaining, which would impose fines of at least €1500 on clients caught paying for sexual relations. Within the National Assembly, most of those who supported the bill were MPs from the Socialist Party, which dominates the house. The law was passed in the National Assembly on December 4, 2013. The bill caused considerable controversy in France among politicians and intellectuals, some for legalizing prostitution, and others wanting it banned. The bill was opposed by many sex workers, and was rejected by the French Senate in July 2014.\n\nFinally, on 6 April 2016, the French National Assembly voted to fine customers of prostitutes €1500.\n\nCritics say most of the frames (nuisance, victim, deviant, security threat) in which sex work is discussed in France are constructed without the input of sex workers who are depicted as voiceless and agencyless. There are exceptions such as the French lesbian feminist Claudie Lesselier.\n\nCSA,\na polling organization, has carried out several surveys on prostitution in France. A 2002 telephone survey analyzed French attitudes about prostitution. 64% of respondents said that prostitution was \"a degrading practice for the image and the dignity of the woman (or the man)\". 66% of those questioned favored the re-opening of the \"maisons closes\" (brothels - see Maisons closes, below), 37% wanted the clients to be criminalized, 22% wanted the prostitutes to be criminalized and 33% wanted all forms of prostitution to be illegal. When analyzed and broken down by age and gender, the survey showed that some people gave contradictory answers: For example, some people appeared to favor both the re-opening of the \"maisons\" (brothels) and the interdiction of all forms of prostitution (probably believing that both solutions would work, as the survey showed that most people were dissatisfied with the existing legal situation). Older people and men were more accepting of the idea of having legalized brothels.\nIn the 2006 poll, only 14% thought prostitution should be illegal.\nPoll results reported in 2010 gave 59% in favor of re-opening of the brothels, and 10% opposed.\nLiberalization is opposed by abolitionist groups such as \"Mouvement du Nid\".\n\nIn May 2011, the seventh anniversary of the introduction of the LSI, Médecins du Monde released a very critical report on the effect of the law, and called for its repeal.\n\nStudies from 2003 estimated that about 15,000 - 20,000 women work as prostitutes in France.\nIn 2010, the number of full-time male and female prostitutes was estimated at 20,000 - 30,000, with 80% being foreigners. In 2018 it was estimated there were 30,000 prostitutes in the country and 90% were foreign.\n\nSex work in France, like other countries takes many forms. These include street prostitution, escort services, bars, and apartment prostitution. Street prostitution is partly controlled by pimps, while other workers are autonomous prostitutes. In some areas, such as Lyon or the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, sex workers use vans (see illustration). The most famous prostitution street in Paris, the \"la Rue Saint-Denis\", has been somewhat gentrified in recent years and the prostitutes have been moved further north. Escort services where one hires a woman or man for \"entertainment\" or companionship, but usually including sex, are less common in France, compared to North America. In bars, women try to induce men to buy expensive drinks along with sexual acts. Prices are set by the bar owner, and the money is shared between the owner and the prostitute. Pigalle peepshows are well known for practicing such scams. Prostitution in apartments is advertised in adult newspapers and magazines. Swingers' clubs are places where partner-swapping occurs and sometimes paid prostitutes are in attendance, as well as \"amateur\" women and couples who get in without paying the flat-rate charge of about 80 to 120 euros that men pay, including food, drink and unlimited sex sessions, with the added twist that these are performed in the open in full view of all the guests.\n\nBrothels () remain illegal, but operate discreetly and clandestinely. Since their official closure in 1946, there have been periodic calls for their re-opening. In 1990, (RPR), a former Minister of Health (1986-1988), suggested re-opening them in 1990 as a public health measure. A row erupted in 2002 with the proposal by Françoise de Panafieu (UMP), which divided French feminists, with Gisèle Halimi denouncing it, but Élisabeth Badinter seeing it as an issue of \"the right to dispose freely of one's body\".\n\nA 2010 proposal by Chantal Brunel for a return to regulated brothels was opposed by French sex workers (see Politics, above).\n\nMeanwhile, Spain has exploited the difference between the two countries by opening brothels along the French-Spanish border.\n\nIn 2004, the average earnings of a French prostitute were estimated at €500 a day. For Sub-Saharian prostitutes living in France, it was less, around €200-300. Some barely made €50-150 a week.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy recognized that the traditional sex worker was part of France's national cultural heritage. \nPaintings and drawings of \"maisons closes\" (brothels), and prostitution appear frequently in art over the centuries, some of which are shown here. Some of the best known are scenes in brothels produced by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Edgar Degas and Pablo Picasso, among others. \nBrassaï published photographs of brothels in his 1935 book \"Voluptés de Paris\". A voluminous illustrated work on the phenomenon is \"Maisons closes. L'histoire, l'art, la littérature, les moeurs\" by Romi (Robert Miquet), first published in 1952.\n\nAmongst writers depicting the life of women in prostitution in France are Honoré de Balzac and Victor Hugo (see bibliography).\n\nThe Musée de l'Erotisme in Paris devotes one floor to the \"maisons closes\". It exhibits \"Polissons et galipettes\", a collection of short erotic silent movies that were used to entertain brothel visitors, and copies of \"Le Guide Rose\", a contemporary brothel guide that also carried advertising. The 2003 BBC Four documentary \"Storyville - Paris Brothel\" describes the \"maisons closes\".\n\nAn exhibition about historical Paris brothels took place from November 2009 to January 2010 in an art gallery across the street from the former \"Le Chabanais\".\n\nFrance is a destination, transit, and a limited source country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Foreign victims from Eastern Europe, West and North Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean are subjected to sex trafficking. Sex trafficking networks controlled by Nigerians, Bulgarians, Romanians, Chinese, and French citizens force women into prostitution through debt bondage, physical force, and psychological coercion, including the invocation of voodoo and drug addiction. The number of children exploited in commercial sex has increased in recent years. Children, primarily from Romania, West and North Africa, and the Middle East, are victims of sex trafficking in France. The government estimates the majority of the 30,000 people in prostitution in France, about 90 percent of whom are foreign, are likely trafficking victims. Trafficking of male victims for sex trafficking has increased. Nigerian trafficking networks use migrant and drug trafficking routes through Libya and Italy to transport girls to France.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks France as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7743530", "categories": ["Prostitution in France"], "title": "Prostitution in France"}

In the 16th century documents, it was also called \"Sebastianowo\", probably after Bishop of Poznań Sebastian Branicki.

It was filmed in the recording block for series 7.\n\nAt the Broadwalk Shopping Centre, Albert and Del Boy sell children's dolls that sing Chinese lullabies.\n\nMeanwhile, at \"Parry Print Ltd\", a hungry Rodney discovers that Cassandra made him a very meagre sandwich for lunch, and his new secretary refuses to go out and buy him a hamburger during the lunch break because an important client is due to see him. However, when he spots Raquel with shopping bags full of delicious food, Rodney invites her into his office, and they chat about the tour that Raquel has been on since the events of \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\", and how Rodney's marriage with Cassandra is faring. Despite claiming they are happy together, Rodney implies that he and Cassandra are experiencing difficulties.\n\nThat evening, Rodney returns home to his flat, only to find that Cassandra has not prepared dinner for him and is instead going out to play badminton. They argue, and Cassandra accuses Rodney of being childish if he expects her to cook for him like a servant from the 1930s. Rodney subsequently storms out. Meanwhile, at Nelson Mandela House, Del and Raquel are enjoying a romantic dinner and, just as Del is about to proposition Raquel, Rodney bursts in and tells everyone that his marriage is over. Rodney decides to sleep in his old bedroom, but Del tells him that Raquel is sleeping there, so Rodney will be sleeping on the sofa.\n\nA week later, at a nightclub, as Del and Raquel dance, Rodney is getting drunk with his friends Mickey Pearce and Chris, which leaves Del concerned. Del tries to make Rodney see sense and return to his wife, but Rodney refuses to listen.\n\nThe next evening, back at the flat, Del tells Albert that when Rodney took the Trotter van down to the Peckham Exhaust Centre earlier that morning to get it fixed, he foolishly arranged a date with an attractive receptionist, Tanya, following Mickey Pearce's advice to make Cassandra jealous. When Rodney tells Del, Raquel, and Albert that he is going to see \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" with Tanya, they try to talk him out of his date, but Rodney ignores them and heads off. Del then realises that Rodney is deliberately taking Tanya to the cinema opposite Cassandra's evening school, where he hopes Cassandra will see them together. Aware that this will lose Rodney both his marriage and his job, Del goes over to Cassandra's flat to persuade her not to go to her class, and ends up breaking the bad news to her. Cassandra is reduced to tears, but agrees not to tell her parents.\n\nLater, back at the flat at midnight, as Del tries to remove the voiceboxes from the Chinese dolls, he gets a telephone call from Rodney, who took Del's advice, cancelled his date, and has decided to wait at his flat for Cassandra, so they can be reconciled. Before Del can warn him about what he just did, Rodney hangs up and removes the receiver from the machine, preventing Del from calling him back. Del admits to Raquel and Albert that he told Cassandra, and then quickly drives over to Rodney and Cassandra's flat. Cassandra arrives moments before Del and furiously throws Rodney out. Rodney confronts Del over telling on him and sends him home, but realises that he himself has been locked out of his home, leaving him no choice but to go back to Nelson Mandela House with Del.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7743570", "categories": ["Only Fools and Horses episodes", "1990 British television episodes"], "title": "Rodney Come Home"}

She saw action in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812 and continued a busy career at sea into the middle of the 19th century. In 1846 she was reduced to harbour service, in 1860 she became a receiving ship, and she was finally disposed of in 1906.\n\n\"Belvidera\" was commissioned in January 1800 under Captain Charles Dashwood. In March, Captain Richard Byron replaced Dashwood. \n\nOn 22 July 1810, \"Belvidera\" and , Captain William Ferris, were sailing close to the shore of Studtland, Norway. That evening a boat from \"Belvedera\" sighted three Danish gun-vessels in a large bay. Next day, seven boats from the two frigates attacked the Danes. Two of the Danish vessels, \"Balder\" and \"Thor\", commanded by Lieutenants Dahlreup and Rasmusen, were schooner-rigged. Each mounted two long 24-pounders and six 6-pounder howitzers and had a crew of 45 men. The third gun-vessel carried one long 24-pounder and a crew of 25 men. The British captured both \"Balder\" and \"Thor\" without suffering any casualties, though the Danes lost four men killed. The remaining vessel, Gunboat No. 5, ran up a fiord where her crew abandoned her; the British then burnt her. \nIn 1811, \"Belvidera\" became the flagship of Admiral Herbert Sawyer on the Halifax station in Nova Scotia.\n\n\"Belvidera\" took part in one of the earliest actions of the War of 1812 when she encountered the American frigates , and on 23 June 1812, five days after the war had started. \"Belvidera\" had been shadowing \"Marengo\" captained by French privateer John Ordronaux. The British were not aware that war had been declared and after returning fire they managed to evade their pursuers during the night. \"Belvidera\"s course during the fight had led the Americans away from a British convoy from Jamaica, allowing the convoy to escape attack. \"Belvidera\" arrived in Halifax on 27 June with three prizes that she captured on the way.\nOn 16 July 1812, \"Belvidera\" was part of a British squadron that gave chase to , another of the United States' heavy frigates, which was on her way from Chesapeake Bay to New York. In the very light winds, both sides put out boats to tow the ships. \"Constitution\" gained an advantage by using her anchors to pull herself about four miles ahead of \"Belvidera\". Captain Byron then copied the manoeuvre of \"Constitution\" and managed to bring the two ships within gunshot. They exchanged fire as a light breeze came up, and by daylight on 19 July \"Constitution\", being newly out of port, was able to escape.\n\nFor the remainder of the war, \"Belvidera\" was active in the blockade of the American coast, capturing many American merchant ships and privateers. Between 1 June 1812 and 14 December 1812, \"Belvidera\" captured a number of merchant vessels:\n\n\"Belvidera\", \"Aeolus\", \"Africa\", \"Shannon\" and \"Guerriere\" were among the vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of on 16 July. At the time of her capture she mounted 16 guns, had crew of 106 men and was under the command of Lieutenant William M. Crane. \n\nOn 21 August \"Belvidera\" captured the U.S. privateer 7-gun schooner \"Bunker's Hill\", with 72 men. On 10 September \"Belvidera\" detained \"Citizen\". Two days later \"Belvidera\" captured the American schooner \"Hiram\". \n\nOn 8 February 1813, nine boats and 200 men of , \"Belvidera\", and , which were at anchor in Lynhaven Bay, chased and captured the letter of marque schooner \"Lottery\", of 225 tons, and pierced for 16 guns though only carrying six 12-pounder carronades. She had a crew 28 men and was sailing from Baltimore to Bordeaux with a cargo of coffee, sugar, and logwood. In the engagement the British had six men wounded, one of whom later died, but \"Belvidera\" herself suffered no casualties. The Americans suffered 19 men wounded, including their captain, John Southcomb, before they struck. Southcomb died of his wounds and his body was taken ashore. \n\nA week later \"Lottery\" convoyed several prizes to Bermuda. The British took \"Lottery\" into service as the 16-gun schooner . \n\n\"Belvidera\" was among the numerous British warships that shared in the capture of the American ship \"St. Michael\" on 10 February. On 25 September 1813, \"Belvidera\", \"Statira\" and were in company when they captured \"Ambition\".\n\nOn 19 December and captured \"Rising States\". \"Belvidera\" and shared in the proceeds of the capture by agreement with \"Jaseur\". Then on Christmas Day, \"Belvidera\" captured the schooner , which was attempting to get from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Newcastle, Delaware. The US had purchased \"Vixen\" at Savannah, Georgia, in 1813 but when \"Belvidera\" captured her she had not yet received her armament of 14 guns nor naval stores.\n\nOn 7 March 1814, \"Belvidera\", and captured the American privateer \"Mars\". \"Mars\" was armed with 15 guns and had a crew of 70 men. A later report has them destroying her on 10 March. \"Belvidera\" was also among the vessels sharing in the proceeds of the capture of the brigs \"Christina\" and \"Massasoit\" on 3 and 14 March.\n\nOn 21 April 1814, \"Belvidera\" captured the US ship , of 256 tons, armed with six guns and with a crew of 17 men. She was sailing from the Marquesas to Philadelphia carrying a cargo of spermaceti oil. \"New Zealander\", a prize to , had departed Valparaiso for the United States and was only one day out of New York when \"Belvidera\" captured her. In addition \"Belvidera\" captured the following American vessels:\n\nAt the end of 1814, \"Belvidera\" was decommissioned at Portsmouth. She was relaunched on 26 September 1817, having been refitted. She made numerous cruises to the Mediterranean, Portugal, Madeira, and the West Indies. In 1834 she took troops to St Kitts and then on a second trip, to Trinidad. On 17 May 1835 she was reported to be at Puerto Rico, where she was attempting to recover either escaped slaves, or slaves that had been improperly sold. \n\nIn October 1846 \"Belvedera\" was fitted at Portsmouth as a store depot. \n\nExtract from Tobermory, Isle of Mull Old Parish Records dated 23 August 1847 :-\nRobert Kerslake Royal Marine on board H M Ship Belvidera at Tobermory Bay and Ann McQuarrie servant or nurse to a Captain Wellington of H M Ship Belvidara Stationed at Tobermory were married by Revd David Ross Minister of Tobermory.\n\n\"Belvidera\" was fitted as a receiving ship in between August and November 1852, and she served in that role at Portsmouth until 1890.She was sold on 10 July 1906 to J.B.

It is funded in part by the Michigan Department of Transportation and is train 370 eastbound and train 371 westbound. The westbound train leaves Grand Rapids during the morning rush, with the eastbound train leaving Chicago after the afternoon rush, enabling same-day business travel between the two cities.\n\nThe train is named for a named train of the defunct Pere Marquette Railway, and in turn for Pere Marquette, Michigan, an early name for Ludington. The town was named for Father Jacques Marquette, a French explorer of the Great Lakes region.\n\nThe \"Pere Marquette\" was a named train of the Pere Marquette Railway, which ran between Detroit and Grand Rapids six times a day. When the \"Pere Marquette\" Railway was absorbed into the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway in 1947, the name was maintained and extended to Chicago.\n\nAmtrak revived the name for its Grand Rapids–Chicago service on August 5, 1984, with financial support from the state of Michigan. Initially it served Chicago, Hammond–Whiting, New Buffalo, St. Joseph, Bangor, Holland and Grand Rapids. Service at Hammond–Whiting ended April 29, 2001 (although other Amtrak trains still stop there). Service at New Buffalo ended October 26, 2009, when a new station opened on a different alignment.\n\nOn November 30, 2007, the southbound \"Pere Marquette\" collided with a Norfolk Southern freight train in Chicago, injuring 71 people. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of the collision was the failure of the Amtrak engineer to interpret the signal at Englewood interlocking correctly and Amtrak's failure to ensure that the engineer had the competence to interpret signals correctly across the different territories over which he operated. The NTSB released its findings on the crash on March 31, 2009.\n\nThe \"Pere Marquette\" operates over Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation trackage:\n\nDuring fiscal year 2016, the \"Pere Marquette\" carried 89,508 passengers, a decrease of 6.6% from 2015, when it carried 95,807 passengers. Ticket revenue in 2016 was $2,906,782, a decrease of 4.4% from 2015's $3,040,677.\n\nDuring 2008, the on-time performance of train 370 (Chicago-Grand Rapids) was 33.6%, of train 371 (Grand Rapids-Chicago) 13.5%. By September 2010, these figures had changed to 63.3% and 13.3% respectively. Amtrak owns of this line, freight railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern the remainder. Track and signal delays and freight train interference make up the majority of delays.\n\nIn October 26, 2009, the New Buffalo Amtrak station was relocated from the CSX trackage to the Amtrak-owned alignment closer to the shore of Lake Michigan. This new station is ADA-accessible and has a more extensive shelter. As a result, the \"Pere Marquette\" no longer stops in New Buffalo, which is served by \"Wolverine\" and \"Blue Water\" trains. The Pere Marquette made a special round trip train to/from Harbor Shores Golf Course for the 2018 Senior PGA Championship.

Organizations such as the United States Marine Corps however, see pull-ups including both the overhand and underhand grips.\n\nVariations of pull-ups, beyond being named for their grip, can also be named based on how high the body rises, by naming it after the body part that either comes into contact with or passes over the top of the bar. A \"chest-up\" or \"sternum-up\" for example, indicates that the chest or sternum meets the bar, requiring extra scapular adduction and depression.\n\nPull-ups are a common way to measure the upper body strength of the \"pulling muscles\". They are used by the United States Marine Corps as a part of the Physical Fitness Test, although marines may also choose to substitute push-ups.\n\nPull-ups were also used as part of military test in Singapore, where the IPPT for National-Service men is used. It is also used in the NAPFA test for male students above the age of 14. It was then removed in 2014 with the announcement of a new IPPT format.\n\nPull-ups can be done with a supinated, neutral, or pronated grip (often called \"chin-ups\", \"hammer grip pull-ups\", and \"pull-ups\", respectively). Grips may match each other or be different (mixed grip). Grips may also rotate throughout the movement, such as by doing them on rings, rotating handles (false grip) or pull up handles. The range of motion used by trainers can vary. The fullest possible range is with straight arms overhead (elbow directly above shoulder), to pulling when the arms are at the sides (elbow directly below shoulder). People sometimes only train portions, such as avoiding locking out the arms at the bottom, or stopping when the head/chin/neck touch the bar. Positions within the range are also trained isometrically, as in flexed-arm and straight-arm hangs for time.\n\nThe width of the grip may also differ. When grabbing and holding the bar during the pull-up, the hands can be apart at shoulder-width, or wider, or narrower enough to touch each other. This may make the pull-up more difficult and may limit the range of motion compared to the shoulder-width grip.\n\nOrganizations such as the American Council on Exercise give advice such as \"care should be taken not to unduly put stress on your shoulder during this exercise\". Elbow pain due to tendonitis, bursitis, and ulnar nerve entrapment can occur as a result of excessive pull ups and improper technique.\n\nBodyweight:\n\nBodyweight (variations):\n\n\nWeighted:\n\nAs of January 2015 the most repetitions within a given time period:\n\n\n", "id": "7743664", "categories": ["Bodyweight exercise"], "title": "Pull-up (exercise)"}

It features a mix of original and acquired series, specials, and feature films. The network operates as a commercial-free service and broadcasts its programming without editing for content. It was originally exclusive to DirecTV. However, after AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV it became available on AT&T U-verse. It is also available on subscription streaming service DirecTV Now, and the upcoming lower budget AT&T Watch TV service. As of 2019, the channel has a subscription base of 26 million.\n\nThe network launched on November 25, 1999 as Freeview, a service on DirecTV channel 103 carrying a continuous loop of concerts and other events. Freeview was part of all of the satellite provider's subscription packages, starting with the Total Choice tier. In 2005, it was moved to channel 101 and was rebranded as The 101 Network (as a suffix, \"101\" is college jargon for basic classes or, in more general terms, a way to describe any basic concept). Following the rebrand, the channel's schedule began to expand to include original programs.\n\nThe channel was rebranded as Audience Network on June 1, 2011.

Although the series had left NBC and moved to DirecTV, NBC.com continued to cover the series official website with new updates and products related to the series as the NBC television network's parent company NBCUniversal still continued to have ownership and production rights to the series, however the options to view new episodes for free on NBC.com and for purchase on Itunes, which became available during their final NBC season were permanently discontinued after the move to DirecTV. Initially the DirecTV episodes were supposed to only be exclusively available on its own network, however in the end of September 2007, just immediately after the DirecTV debut of the series, DirecTV announced that they made an agreement to allow NBC to rebroadcast the DirecTV episodes, but only as an internet content on NBC.com with a monthly subscription fee as an alternative for viewers who were unable to subscribe to DirecTV to continue watching the new episodes after the series left the free over the air broadcast television network, NBC and moved to paid television subscription service, DirecTV. The paid online streaming service to view the DirecTV episodes on NBC.com began in October 2007. In December 2007, DirecTV announced that it would not pick up \"Passions\" from NBC for a tenth season, the series finale aired on August 7, 2008.\n\nDirecTV, NBC, and Universal Media Studios announced a deal on April 2, 2008, in which The 101 would carry the 13-episode third season of \"Friday Night Lights\" beginning on October 1.

They are characterized by a white spore print, a small conical or bell-shaped cap, and a thin fragile stem. Most are gray or brown, but a few species have brighter colors. Most have a translucent and striate cap, which rarely has an incurved margin. The gills are attached and usually have cystidia. Some species, like \"Mycena haematopus\", exude a latex when the stem is broken, and many species have a chlorine-like odor.\n\n\"Mycenas\" are hard to identify to species and some are distinguishable only by microscopic features such as the shape of the cystidia. Some species are edible, while others contain toxins, but the edibility of most is not known, as they are too small to be useful in cooking. \"Mycena cyanorrhiza\" stains blue and contains the hallucinogen psilocybin and \"Mycena pura\" contains the mycotoxin muscarine.\n\nOver 33 species are known to be bioluminescent, creating a glow known as foxfire. These species are divided among 16 lineages, leading to evolutionary uncertainty in whether the luminescence developed once and was lost among many species, or evolved in parallel by several species. One advantage of bioluminescence may lie in its potential to attract insects that can disperse the mushroom's spores.\n\nAlexander Smith's 1947 \"Mycena\" monograph identified 232 species; the genus is now known to include about 500 species worldwide. Maas Geesteranus divided the genus into 38 sections in 1992, providing keys to each for all the species of the Northern Hemisphere. Many new species have been discovered since then, and four new sections have been proposed. Taxonomy is complex, as most sections are not truly homogeneous, and the keys fail for some species, especially those that satisfy some criteria for only part of their life cycle. Some sections contain only one species.\n\nThe name \"Mycena\" comes from the Ancient Greek μύκης \"mykes\", meaning \"mushroom.\" Species in the genus \"Mycena\" (and in \"Hemimycena\") are commonly known as bonnets.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7743756", "categories": ["Mycena", "Agaricales genera"], "title": "Mycena"}

He reengaged in the lumber and shook business until 1880. Barker was also highly involved in Freemasonry. In 1896 Barker was nominated to run for congress by the Prohibition Party. This was his final political race, and he lost. He died in Altoona, Pennsylvania, while on a visit for medical treatment in 1898.\n\n Retrieved on 2008-02-14\n\n", "id": "7743798", "categories": ["Union Army soldiers", "Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania", "1816 births", "People of Maine in the American Civil War", "19th-century American politicians", "People from Lovell, Maine", "People from Cheltenham, Pennsylvania", "1898 deaths", "Pennsylvania Republicans", "Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives", "Pennsylvania Prohibitionists"], "title": "Abraham Andrews Barker"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7743824", "text": "Hotel Pennsylvania\n\nThe Hotel Pennsylvania is a hotel located at 401 Seventh Avenue (15 Penn Plaza) in Manhattan, across the street from Pennsylvania Station and Madison Square Garden in New York City. It is currently the fourth largest hotel in the city.\n\nThe Hotel Pennsylvania was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad and operated by Ellsworth Statler. It opened on January 25, 1919 and was designed by William Symmes Richardson of the firm of McKim, Mead & White, which also designed the original Pennsylvania Station located across the street.\n\nStatler Hotels, which had managed the Pennsylvania since its construction, acquired the property outright from the Pennsylvania Railroad on June 30, 1948 and renamed it the Hotel Statler on January 1, 1949. Following the sale of all 17 Statler hotels to Conrad Hilton in 1954, the hotel became the Statler Hilton. It operated under this name until 1979, when Hilton sold the hotel to developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., for $24 million. The hotel was renamed the New York Statler and was operated by Dunfey hotels, a division of Aer Lingus. The hotel was sold again for $46 million in August 1983. A 50% interest was bought by Abelco, an investment group consisting of developers Elie Hirschfeld, Abraham Hirschfeld, and Arthur G. Cohen, with the other 50% bought by the Penta Hotels chain, a joint-venture of British Airways, Lufthansa, and Swissair. The new owners renamed the hotel the New York Penta and undertook a massive renovation. In 1991, Penta's partners bought out the chain's stake in the hotel and returned it to its original name, Hotel Pennsylvania.\n\nThe threat of the Hotel Pennsylvania's demolition was first introduced in 1997 when Vornado Realty Trust bought the hotel in a joint venture with Ong Beng Seng, a Singaporean hotel developer and financier. Vornado and Seng's company then announced on September 25, 1997 the formation of a joint venture for converting the hotel into the first Official All Star Hotel. The plans were halted by mid-1999 as Planet Hollywood sold its stake to a New Jersey-based real estate investment trust.\n\nVornado announced in 2007 that the hotel was to be demolished to make way for a new office building with Merrill Lynch as its anchor tenant. Owner Vornado Realty Trust intended to build a building by 2011.\n\nIn 2006, the Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation (now the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society) was created. Shortly after the announcement of Vornado's plans, the staff of \"\", a magazine which sponsors biennial HOPE hacker conventions at the hotel, began investigating possible ways to save the hotel from demolition. They were joined by the new Save the Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation, whose members included a number of city organizations and politicians to aid in the landmarking of the hotel, including the Historic Districts Council, Manhattan Community Board 5, and Assemblyman Richard Gottfried. In November 2007, Manhattan Community Board 5 voted 21-8 to have New York City Council landmark the historic hotel. However, in February 2008 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission denied the request for landmarking.\n\nPreservation efforts have proven difficult. Emmanuel Goldstein of \"2600\" noted that while people overseas expressed concern over the fate of the hotel:\n\nNew Yorkers might not care enough to get involved. The hotel was old; the rooms weren't as big and luxurious as other more modern facilities; and New Yorkers simply weren't in a position to grasp the importance of such a place since they normally don't need cheap and easily accessible hotels if they already live here.\n\nIn May 2010, the hotel was again in danger of demolition. Manhattan Borough president Scott Stringer gave a conditional approval overruling Manhattan Community Board 5. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission reviewed the hotel's Cafe Rouge for landmark status based on a request by the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society, but on October 22, 2010, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission declined to designate the cafe as a landmark.\n\nOn July 14, 2010, the New York City Department of City Planning voted unanimously in favor of the construction of the tower. On August 23, 2010, the NYC Council voted to approve the proposed Uniform Land Use Review Procedure submitted by the building owners.\n\nOn December 14, 2011, Vornado proposed to delay the demolition of the hotel due to market conditions.\n\nOn March 4, 2013, Vornado revealed they were abandoning plans to demolish the hotel and replace it with the office tower. The decision was followed by a statement by chairman Steven Roth:\n\nWe're not going to tear down the hotel. In fact, we're going to invest in it aggressively and try to make it into a really profitable, really good hotel for our purposes.\n\nVornado has confirmed they will be renovating and improving the hotel, but beyond that not much else is known. Preservationists as well as those in the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society (formerly the Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation) would like to see the renovations develop into restorations, bringing the hotel back to its 1919 splendor.\n\nIn March 2018, Vornado Realty Trust renewed special permits with the City Planning Commission to develop the proposed 15 Penn Plaza skyscraper on the Hotel Pennsylvania's site. In an April 2018 letter to investors, Vornado chairman Steven Roth mentioned the demolition/15 Penn skyscraper plan as a continued option, but also described Vornado as being at \"a tipping point\" with regard to redeveloping the Pennsylvania into a \"giant convention/entertainment hotel\".\n\nThe hotel has the distinction of having the New York phone number in longest continuous use. The number, Pennsylvania 6-5000 (212-736-5000), is the inspiration for the Jerry Gray composition of the same name (with lyrics later added by Carl Sigman). The most popular version was performed by Glenn Miller, with the Andrews Sisters' version not far behind.\n\nThe Cafe Rouge was originally the main restaurant in the Hotel Pennsylvania. It served as a nightclub for many years, but now operates as a separate venue from the hotel entirely, as a multi-purpose space. It is the only space in the hotel that escaped significant alterations during the buildings massive 1980s renovation.\n\nThe Cafe Rouge measured , with a ceiling height of , with a main central level and two terraces on either side. The terraces were raised . The Café was designed with a distinctly Italian character. Both the wall base and door trim were made of terracotta, the walls were artificial limestone, and the ceiling was treated to give the effect of old wooden beamed ceilings. The ceiling was carefully studied in color to increase the apparent height of the room, and the beams of the ceiling had carvings of various designs. The east end of the Café had a large floor to ceiling fountain. The Café had large arched windows running along the exterior wall of the room. The arched window design was mimicked on the opposite wall. A bandstand was located on the central floor of the room on the exterior wall.\n\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, The Café Rouge had a big band remote connection to the NBC Radio Network and became famous for the performances held inside. Multiple artists played inside the Café – such as The Dorsey Brothers, Woody Herman, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and The Andrews Sisters.\n\nOne evening in November 1939, while in the midst of a steady long-term engagement at the Cafe Rouge, bandleader Artie Shaw left the bandstand between sets and decided he had enough of the band business and all the hype of having become in a year and a half's time the leader of the most popular big band in the country. Shaw essentially quit his own band on the spot; the act obliging even the \"New York Times\" to comment in an editorial.\n\nFrom 1940–42, Glenn Miller's band also had repeated long-term bookings in the room during the three years of Miller's great popularity as a major bandleader of the Swing Era. Glenn Miller and his Glenn Miller Orchestra broadcast multiple live radio performances from the Café; some were recorded by RCA Victor. Gray, Shaw's principal orchestrator from 1937–39, was immediately hired by Miller as a staff arranger when Shaw deserted his band; it was during Miller's 1940 engagement at the hotel that Gray wrote the popular instrumental tune that immortalized the Hotel's telephone number. The hotel's telephone number appears in the title of one of his best-known songs, \"Pennsylvania 6-5000\".\n\nLes Brown's band, with its vocalist Doris Day, introduced their song \"Sentimental Journey\" at the Café in November 1944.\n\nThe Café Rouge is no longer considered a part of the Hotel Pennsylvania business and has a separate address and entrance from the street at 145 West 32nd Street. The hotel structure is currently owned by Vornado Realty Trust.\n\nIn 2007, for the Garden in Transit project, adhesive weatherproof paintings of flowers attached to NYC taxicabs were painted inside the Café.\n\nThe New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission reviewed the Café Rouge for landmarking status on the basis of evaluation papers created by the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society (formerly the Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation) On October 22, 2010 the Café was rejected as a candidate for landmarking, most likely because the 15 Penn Plaza project was approved and the moderate, but not destructive alterations of the interior since its construction. The 15 Penn Plaza project, would have included the demolition of the Café.\n\nMost of the original interior decor remains intact. The fountain and beamed ceiling and other architectural details remain, though the entire room, as well as the ceiling, have been painted over in white.\nNumerous events from the 2013 New York Fashion Week were held in the Cafe Rouge.\n\nIn 2014, the Café Rouge was converted to an indoor basketball court known as Terminal 23, to commemorate the launch of the Melo M10 by the Jordan Brand division of Nike. It provides a facility for youth and high school players.\n\n\n\nContrary to common floor numbering practice, there is a 13th floor. The hotel states it has 22 floors from street level to the roof, plus three additional levels in the penthouse. The highest penthouse level is numbered as the 21st floor. The discrepancy in floor numbering is due to several mezzanine-type levels that carry names such as \"lobby mezzanine\" instead of floor numbers.\n\n\n", "id": "7743824", "categories": ["Railway hotels in the United States", "Hotel buildings completed in 1919", "Pennsylvania Railroad", "Culture of New York City", "Glenn Miller songs", "Pennsylvania Plaza", "Skyscraper hotels in Manhattan", "Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)", "McKim, Mead &amp; White buildings", "Midtown Manhattan", "Landmarks in Manhattan"], "title": "Hotel Pennsylvania"}

They are known for their high amount of torque at low RPM, massive cast-iron blocks and heads and also their high reliability. The F Engine had one of the longest production runs of any Toyota engine. The F engines all incorporate overhead valves actuated by pushrods from a gear driven camshaft in the lower portion of the engine. The engine was first introduced in the Land Cruiser, and in many countries, was the only engines offered in the Landcruiser until 1993. Although it's commonly badged as the Land Cruiser engine, it was used in a variety of other large truck applications as well, such as in fire trucks and the Toyota FQ15 trucks. It was also used in the FH26 police patrol car (based on the RH Super), FS20-FS50 police patrol cars (based on the RS20-MS50 Crown), the FHJ and FH24 fire trucks (both based on the RH Super) and the FS35 (based on the RS30 Crown) and FS45V ambulance (based on the MS40 Crown).\n\nThe F engine is a 3.9-liter, 75/93 kW (105/125 hp), carburated gasoline engine that is capable of 261/289 N·m (189/209 lb·ft) of torque at 2000 RPM; the difference in power and torque is different depending on the export destination. The original design was started in the early 1950s when Toyota had begun to export their vehicles internationally.\n\nThe F engine block, crankshaft and lower end assembly is loosely based on the 1939-63 G.M.C. L6 OHV 235 engine but with a taller deck (rather than the similar but smaller Chevrolet 1937-63 Gen-2 L6 OHV engine), and built under license. The cylinder head and combustion chamber is derived from the Chevrolet L6 OHV \"stovebolt\" engine, slightly scaled up. The general idea was consumers would feel comfortable with the engine since it was a familiar design and had a proven track record. None of the bottom end of the engine is interchangeable with these engines.\n\nThe F engine replaced the early 3.4-liter B gasoline engine introduced in 1937 (not to be confused with the 2.9-liter B diesel engine introduced much later). The early B engine was based on the original 1929-36 Chevrolet Gen-1 207 inline-6, not the later 1937-63 Gen-2 216, 235 etc. engine.\n\nThe updated F engine is a 3.9-liter, 75/93 kW (105/125 hp), carburated gasoline engine that is capable of 261/289 N·m (189/209 lb·ft) of torque at 2000 RPM; the major difference between the F and the F.5 is the oiling system. The F.5 uses the same oiling set-up and configuration as its 2F successor.\n\nThe second version of the engine, called the 2F, was introduced in 1975. There are a few differences between the F and 2F, i.e., a larger bore in the 2F, removing one oil ring and forcing the oil to travel through the oil filter before the engine.\n\nThe 3F was introduced in 1985, but did not become available in the United States until 1988. Differences from the 2F engine include a modified cylinder head to reduce warping and separation from inlet and exhaust manifolds, the introduction of electronic fuel injection (EFI) in some markets, a vastly improved emissions system, and a smaller displacement resulting from a shorter piston stroke. The displacement decreased from 4.2 liters to 4 liters, but the engine power increased by and torque increased by . As a result of these changes to the engine design the redline was increased, allowing a wider powerband which made this engine far more suitable for on-road travel.\n\nIn 1992, the F series engines, after almost 45 years, finally ceased production. In 1993, the F series was replaced by the dual overhead cam (DOHC) 1FZ series.\n\nDue to the low rpm design and cast iron construction of these engines, it is not uncommon to see them reach over before needing a major overhaul.\n", "id": "7743829", "categories": ["Toyota engines"], "title": "Toyota F engine"}

The Tibetan name translates to the \"Great Place of Complete Joy\". It currently has over 150 monks in residence. It features a 26.5-meter-high statue of Avalokiteśvara. It came under state protection in 1994.\n\nThe monastery was constructed by order of the 5th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu in 1809. The first temple was the Gungaachoilin Datsan. Only one wooden pillar remains from this temple. In 1838, the Gandantegchenlin Temple was built along with the private residence of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. The 13th Dalai Lama stayed in the residence in 1904. In 1840, the Vajradhara Temple was built. In 1869, the Zuu Temple was built. In 1913, the tall Avalokiteśvara temple was built. In 1925, the temple for keeping the remains of the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu was built. It is now the monastery library.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Communist government of Mongolia, under the leadership of Khorloogiin Choibalsan and under the influence of Joseph Stalin, destroyed all but a few monasteries and killed more than 15,000 lamas.\n\nGandantegchinlen Khiid monastery, having escaped this mass destruction, was closed in 1938, but then reopened in 1944 and was allowed to continue as the only functioning Buddhist monastery, under a skeleton staff, as a token homage to traditional Mongolian culture and religion. With the end of Marxism in Mongolia in 1990, restrictions on worship were lifted.\n\nThe original statue, made of copper, was built after appeals to the Mongolian public; its intent was to restore the sight of the 8th Jebtsundamba, also known as Bogd Khan), who had claimed the title of Emperor of Mongolia. The statue was built by Bogd Javzandamba's principal minister, Chin Wan Khanddorj. Russian troops dismantled the original statue in 1938. After the end of the Soviet era, the statue of Avalokiteśvara was rebuilt in 1996, funded by donations by the Mongolian people. It features 2,286 precious stones and is gilded with gold leaf.\n\nSince 1992, the Supreme Leader of the Centre of All Mongolian Buddhists and Abbot of Gandantegchinlen Monastery has been Lama Gabju Choijamts Demberel.\n\nThe monastery is surrounded by the Gandan ger suburb.\n\n\n", "id": "7743838", "categories": ["Buddhism in Ulaanbaatar", "Buddhist monasteries in Mongolia", "Buildings and structures in Ulaanbaatar", "Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia"], "title": "Gandantegchinlen Monastery"}

The line connects Port Huron, Michigan, and Chicago, Illinois, via East Lansing, Michigan.\n\nThe Lansing area, home of the Michigan state capitol and Michigan State University, was left out of Amtrak's original system. Beginning in 1973, Amtrak and the state discussed restoring service over the Grand Trunk Western Railway within the state, although the new route would join Amtrak's other Michigan trains on the Penn Central west of Battle Creek, Michigan, eschewing the Grand Trunk's traditional route to Chicago. New stations were built in Port Huron and East Lansing, and the state spent $1 million on track rehabilitation. Service began September 15, 1974, between Chicago and Port Huron, with the intention of eventually restoring the Port Huron–Toronto leg.\n\nAmtrak renamed the train the \"Blue Water Limited\" on October 26, 1975, and re-equipped it with French-built Turboliner trainsets on May 20, 1976. The new Turboliners were capable of, but never reached, and ran with fixed five-car consists with an overall capacity of 292 passengers. The Turboliners were withdrawn on October 25, 1981, replaced by conventional locomotives pulling Amfleet coaches.\n\nThe long-discussed extension to Toronto finally occurred on October 31, 1982. The extended service received the name \"International Limited\", the name of an old Canadian National/Grand Trunk Chicago–Detroit–Montreal train. Amtrak and Via Rail, the independent Canadian Crown corporation rail company, jointly operated the \"International Limited\" (later just \"International\") until April 25, 2004, when cross-border service was discontinued. Massive border delays post-September 11 led to falling ridership; Amtrak and Michigan agreed to truncate service at Port Huron and bring back the old \"Blue Water\". On the Canadian side service ends at Sarnia as part of the VIA Rail's Corridor route.\n\nWith a more favorable intrastate schedule and fewer delays, the \"Blue Water\" ridership showed immediate improvements, carrying 94,378 passengers in fiscal year 2004 (compared to 80,890 in FY 2003). \"Blue Water\" ridership in FY 2011 totaled 187,065, an increase of 18.0 percent from FY 2010's total of 157,709, and the highest total ever recorded by the train. During FY 2011, the train had a total revenue of $5.8 million, a 22.3 percent increase from FY 2010's total of $4.7 million.\n\nThe \"Blue Water\" operates over Norfolk Southern Railway, Amtrak, and Grand Trunk Western Railroad trackage:\n\nThe Detroit–Chicago corridor has been designated by the Federal Railroad Administration as a high-speed rail corridor. A stretch along the route of \"Blue Water\" from Porter, Indiana to Kalamazoo, Michigan is the longest segment of track owned by Amtrak outside of the Northeast Corridor.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7743886", "text": "Anton Gag\n\nAnton Gag (born Anton Gaag; June 12, 1859 in Walk, Tachau, (now) Czech Republic – May 22, 1908 in New Ulm, Minnesota) was a Bohemian-American painter and studio photographer known for his portraits, still lifes, landscapes, and murals. Immigrating to the United States at the age of 14 with his family in 1873, he later settled in New Ulm, Minnesota, where he spent most of his working life.\n\nTogether with other local painters, Gag decorated altars and walls of several churches in the area. He and a partner also produced a large panorama with eleven panels on the Dakota War of 1862. One of his paintings of the Battle of New Ulm hangs in the Minnesota Capitol building.\n\nAnton Gaag was born in 1859 as the last of five children in his family in Walk (now Valcha), a hamlet of 15 homes in the county of Tachau (Tachov), in Bohemia, then a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father George Gaag was a wood craftsman and his mother Theresia Heller was the daughter of a sheepherder. This county is now within the Czech Republic.\n\nHis family immigrated to the United States in 1873, when Gaag was 14; his older sister had earlier emigrated there. They first settled in St. Paul, Minnesota, a city on the Mississippi River. (He changed the spelling of his surname to \"Gag\" after some time in the US.) By the time he was growing up there, the city had grown to 30,000 people. For a time he lived with his older brother Joseph, a tailor. In the 1875-76 city directory, Gag identified as an \"artist\". By 1878-79 he was working as a \"cigar maker\".\n\nIn 1880 Gag moved to New Ulm, an immigrant community along the Cottonwood River. It had many residents who were ethnic German and Bohemian, and most of his family had settled here. He was befriended by August Schell, founder of Schell's Brewery. The older man acted as a mentor and patron, commissioning Gag to paint murals in a guest house.\n\nThat year Schell also arranged for Gag to attend art school in Chicago, likely the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, and to study for a time in Milwaukee. After his return to New Ulm, Gag earned most of his income through his photography studio, especially portraits and the popular \"cartes-de-visite.\" He pursued working as an artist, although it did not earn him much money.\n\nIn 1886, Gag married Ida Berndt. She died the next year of complications from child birth. Their infant daughter died a month later.\n\nIn 1892 the young widower Gag married Elizabeth (known as Lissi) Biebl of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, whose family had migrated to Minnesota. They were well-educated immigrants from Kscheutz (Ksire), Bohemia. Lissi had worked as his assistant in his photography studio. They raised a family of seven children in the German tradition. He was known to allow his children much freedom and was non-conforming in his personal behavior. His life and art were formed by the liberal humanist values of the German-Bohemian culture.\n\nIn 1894, Gag built a Queen-Anne style family home that he decorated with murals. He reserved a room in it for his photographic studio. He also painted works on canvas and board. With other local artists Alexander Schwendihger and Christian Heller, he decorated New Ulm's Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, built in 1883 in the German Baroque style. They created an altar and painted ceiling murals that were similar to traditional church ornament in Bohemia. The trio also worked in 1898 for St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Zumbro Falls, Minnesota. Heller and Gag renovated the Congregational Church in New Ulm that year.\n\nTogether with Heller, Gag collaborated on a large panorama of the Dakota War of 1862, telling about the second battle of New Ulm. These works, often devoted to historical events, were highly popular. This panorama had 11 panels, each 7 x 10 feet, and painted on a long roll of fabric. It was favorably received. The firm of Heller and Gag also performed interior decoration of homes and clubs, painted drop curtains for theatres, and at times employed up to 30 workmen for their many projects.\nGag painted an estimated 60 works: his 1904 painting \"Battle of New Ulm\" (1904) depicted part of the Dakota War. It is displayed in the Minnesota State Capitol.\n\nGag died at age 48 in New Ulm in 1908 from tuberculosis. His daughter, Wanda Gág (who added the accent to her name), became a celebrated author and artist in her own right. She continued to live in the family house after her parents died.\n\nThe house where the Gag family lived, at 226 N. Washington, New Ulm, is now known as the Wanda Gág House. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is open for public tours. The house has been preserved and is operated as a museum to tell the story of this family, showing examples of their art and way of life during their residence. The exterior of the house has been restored to the original colors of the period when the Gag family lived there, including Wanda after her parents died. The interior is also being restored to that time period. The process has uncovered detailed, decorative hand-painting done by Gag and Wanda on walls throughout the house.\n", "id": "7743886", "categories": ["20th-century American painters", "Artists from Minnesota", "People from New Ulm, Minnesota", "American people of Bohemian descent", "19th-century American painters", "People from Tachov", "1908 deaths", "Austro-Hungarian emigrants to the United States", "American male painters", "1859 births"], "title": "Anton Gag"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7743915", "text": "Need for cognition\n\nThe need for cognition (NFC), in psychology, is a personality variable reflecting the extent to which individuals are inclined towards effortful cognitive activities.\n\nNeed for cognition has been variously defined as \"a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways\" and \"a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world\". Higher NFC is associated with increased appreciation of debate, idea evaluation, and problem solving. Those with a high need for cognition may be inclined towards high elaboration. Those with a lower need for cognition may display opposite tendencies, and may process information more heuristically, often through low elaboration.\n\nNeed for cognition is closely related to the five factor model domain openness to experience, typical intellectual engagement, and epistemic curiosity (see below).\n\nCohen, Stotland and Wolfe (1955), in their work on individual differences in cognitive motivation, identified a \"\"need for cognition\"\" which they defined as \"the individual's need to organize his experience meaningfully\", the \"need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways\", and \"need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world\" (p. 291). They argued that, if this \"need\" were frustrated, it would generate \"feelings of tension and deprivation\" that would instigate \"active efforts to structure the situation and increase understanding\" (p. 291), though the particular situations arousing and satisfying the need may vary (p. 291). Cohen argued that even in structured situations, people high in NFC see ambiguity and strive for higher standards of cognitive clarity.\n\nCohen and colleagues themselves identified multiple prior identifications of need for cognition, citing works by Murphy, Maslow, Katz, Harlow and Asch They distinguished their concept from the apparently similar \"intolerance of ambiguity\" proposed by Frenkel-Brunswik, arguing that NFC does not reflect the need to experience an integrated and meaningful world. Contemporary research suggests that Cohen's conception of need is, however, closer to tolerance of ambiguity, need for structure, or need for cognitive closure than to current ideas of need for cognition. For instance, studies using Cohen's measures indicated avoidance of ambiguity and a need to get \"meaning\" even if this meant relying on heuristics or expert advice rather than careful scrutiny of incoming information.\n\nBuilding on this work, Cacioppo therefore moved away from drive-reduction toward measuring individual differences in the self-reward potential of cognitive activity, stressing (p. 118) that they were using the word need in the statistical sense of a \"likelihood or tendency\", rather than in the rudimentary biological sense of \"tissue deprivation\", they defined the need for cognition as an individual's tendency to \"engage in and enjoy thinking\" (p. 116) and the tendency to \"organize, abstract, and evaluate information\" (p. 124)—or, variously, as a stable, but individually different \"tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors\", or an \"intrinsic motivation to engage in effortful cognitive endeavors... and exercise their mental faculties\", or an \"intrinsic motivation for effortful thought\".\n\nCacioppo and Petty (1982) created their own 34-item scale to measure the need for cognition. Two years later, an 18-item version was published and in most of the cases reported in the subsequent literature it is this amended scale that is administered. Recently, a 6-item version of the need for cognition scale was proposed.\n\nPeople high in the need for cognition are more likely to form their attitudes by paying close attention to relevant arguments (i.e., via the central route to persuasion), whereas people low in the need for cognition are more likely to rely on peripheral cues, such as how attractive or credible a speaker is. People low in need for cognition are also more likely to rely on stereotypes alone in judging other people than those high in need for cognition.\n\nPsychological research on the need for cognition has been conducted using self-report tests, where research participants answered a series of statements such as \"I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that I must solve\" and were scored on how much they felt the statements represented them. The results have suggested that people who are high in the need for cognition scale score slightly higher in verbal intelligence tests but no higher in abstract reasoning tests.\n\nResearch has concluded that individuals high in NFC are less likely to attribute higher social desirability to more attractive individuals or to mates. College students high in NFC report higher life satisfaction.\n\nA study on lucid dreaming found that frequent and occasional lucid dreamers scored higher on NFC than non-lucid dreamers. This suggests there is continuity between waking and dreaming cognitive styles. Researchers have argued that this is because self-reflectiveness or self-focused attention is heightened in lucid dreams and also is associated with greater need for cognition.\n\nA number of studies have found moderate correlations between NFC and measures of verbal intelligence. One study found that need for cognition had a moderate positive correlation with fluid intelligence (reasoning ability, particularly verbal, and to a lesser extent numeric and figural reasoning), and a weaker correlation with crystallised intelligence (knowledge), which had much smaller positive correlations.\n\nNFC has been incorporated into Epstein's dual-system theory of personality called cognitive-experiential self-theory. The theory proposes that people have two information processing systems, a rational system and an experiential system. The rational system is thought to be logical, verbal and relatively unemotional. The experiential system is thought to be intuitive, based on images and highly reliant on emotion. A modified version of the Need for Cognition scale has been used to assess individual differences in the rational system, whereas the experiential system has been assessed using a scale called Faith in Intuition.\n\nResearch shows that the two systems are uncorrelated and hence independent of each other. That is individuals either high or low in need for cognition may also make use of their intuitions in forming judgments. In fact, individuals high and low in need for cognition respectively may make use of their intuitions in differing ways. When individuals give little thought to their judgments these judgments may be influenced directly by emotions, intuitions, and images in an automatic way. On the other hand, those who are high in need for cognition tend to give more thought to their judgments, and the thoughts generated may be indirectly biased by their emotions, intuitions, and images. Hence individuals high in need for cognition are not necessarily more \"rational\" than those low in this trait, if their faith in intuition is also high. Rather, their \"irrational\" intuitions tend to be given more thoughtful elaboration than those who are low in need for cognition and yet also high in faith in intuition.\n\nNFC is associated with the amount of thought that goes into making a decision. Both high and low levels of the trait may be associated with particular biases in judgment. People low in need for cognition tend to show more bias when this bias is due to relying on mental shortcuts, that is, heuristic biases. People high in this trait tend to be more affected by biases that are generated by effortful thought.\n\nHigh need for cognition is associated with a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks. In a commonly used research paradigm, participants are asked to memorise a list of related words. Recognition is tested by having them pick out learned words from a set of studied and non-studied items. Certain non-studied items are conceptually related to studied items (e.g., \"chair\" if the original list contained \"table\" and \"legs\"). People high in NFC are more likely to show false memory for these lures, due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as they are more likely to think of semantically related (but non-studied) items.\n\nA bias associated with low need for cognition is the halo effect, a phenomenon in which attractive or likeable people tend to be rated as superior on a variety of other characteristics (e.g., intelligence). People low on NFC are more likely to rely on stereotypes rather than individual features of a person when rating a novel target. People high in NFC still show a halo effect however, albeit a smaller one, perhaps because their thoughts about the target are still biased by the target's attractiveness.\n\nNFC has been found to be strongly associated with a number of independently developed constructs, specifically epistemic curiosity, typical intellectual engagement, and openness to ideas.\n\n\nResearch has shown that high-need-for-cognition consumers prefer open-ended comparative advertising that allows consumers to decide which brand is best.\n\nNFC has also offered insights into how people respond to alternative web site designs. Martin, Sherrard and Wentzel (2005) demonstrate that high-need for cognition people prefer web sites with high verbal complexity (more in-depth information) and low visual complexity (static images rather than animations).\n\n\n\n", "id": "7743915", "categories": ["Intelligence", "Educational psychology", "Personality traits"], "title": "Need for cognition"}

Since The Bahamas does not have an army or an air force, its navy composes the entirety of its armed forces. Under The Defence Act, the Royal Bahamas Defence Force has been mandated to defend The Bahamas, protect its territorial integrity, patrol its waters, provide assistance in times of disaster, maintain order in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies of The Bahamas, and carry out any such duties as determined by the National Security Council. The Defence Force is also a member of CARICOM's Regional Security Task Force. The task force has seen action in the United Nations mandate in Haiti 1994.\n\nBy an Act of Parliament, the RBDF became an official entity on 31 March 1980, falling under the Ministry of National Security. The Queen of The Bahamas, Queen Elizabeth II, is Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Force with her ceremonial role exercised by the Governor General of the Bahamas. The Defence Force also has adopted its own system of medals and awards.\n\nFormer Commodores of the RBDF were:\n\nWilliam Swinley (RN) 1976-81\n\nChristopher Belton (RN) 1981-83\n\nLeon Smith 1983-1997\n\nDavy Rolle 1997-2010\n\nThe only combat action the RBDF has ever been involved in has been against Cuba. On 10 May 1980, the HMBS \"Flamingo\" attempted to arrest two Cuban fishing vessels, the \"Ferrocem 165\" and the \"Ferrocem 54\", for poaching in Bahamian waters. In retaliation, two Cuban MiG-21s invaded Bahamas airspace and fired on the patrol boat. The Cubans sank the ship with their 23 mm cannons, and fired upon Marines in distress in the water. Fenrick Sturrup, Austin Smith, David Tucker and Edward Williams, all Bahamian Defence Force Marines, were killed in the attack. Fifteen crewmen and the Commander made it safely to Duncan Town, on Ragged Island, after being picked up by the fishing vessels they had boarded. The poachers were convicted in July 1980, and Cuba eventually admitted responsibility, paying the Bahamas $10 million in compensation for the incident.\n\nThe RBDF is a strictly naval force, differing from the rest of its Caribbean and British Commonwealth counterparts in there being no regular land-based military formations. With about 1,600 members however, it is the largest of the Commonwealth Caribbean navies.\n\nServing members of the RBDF are assigned to one of six major sub-sections: Headquarters, Administration, Engineering, Supply, Operations and The Commando Squadron. The Operations Department contains the mobile arms of the RBDF and comprises the main operational units:\n\n\nThe Commando Squadron is a sizable force of 500 Special Marine Commandos. Training is conducted with U.S. Special Operations Forces and British equivalents (such as the Royal Marines) in special operations and maritime warfare. A common training practice is to have a marine recruit conduct a two-mile swim carrying a forty-pound rucksack.\n\nSeveral changes in equipment have been seen in the recent history of the RBDF. Originally British-style uniforms were worn by RBDF personnel; now U.S. Marine Corps-style digital woodland camouflage is worn (as opposed to the U.S. Army universal camouflage worn by The Royal Bahamas Police Force Drug Enforcement Unit). Similarly, the first weapons employed by the RBDF were the British Sterling submachine gun and the L1A1 SLR; now the U.S.-manufactured M4 carbine and the Heckler & Koch UMP sub machine gun are employed for front-line duties.\n\nThe M101 105mm Howitzer towed artillery piece is also employed, with fifteen guns in RBDF service.\n\nThere are two career tracks in the RBDF: Marine (rating) & Officer (ranks). The enlisted personnel ranks range from Marine Seaman to Force Chief Petty Officer. The Officer ranks range from Midshipman to Commodore. The force is organized and trained along the lines of the British Royal Navy and many of the officers attend British service academies.\n\nThe Headquarters of the Defence Force are at RBDF Base HMBS Coral Harbour, on New Providence Island. The commander officer, known as \"The Commander of the Defence Force\" is Commodore Tellis Bethel. Additional bases are located in Matthew Town, Inagua and Freeport, Grand Bahama.\n\nThe RBDF uses the British Royal Navy style of rank insignia, and all ships carry the title HMBS (Her Majesty’s Bahamian Ship).\n\nDue to a lack of ships, most RBDF members do not spend time at sea, and are used for other military or non-military roles. The Defence Force is primarily an armed service, whose roles also encompass some aspects of a coast guard as well as a disaster relief agency. These roles require Defence Force personnel to assume the duties of:\nNaval and infantry personnel,\nPolice Officers (Peace Officer),\nCustoms Officers,\nImmigration Officers,\nFisheries Inspectors,\nEmergency Rescue Personnel,\nSearch & Rescue,\nSentry,\nDetention Center security and\nMaintenance of Navigational Aids.\n\nThe RBDF offers a high school course called the Royal Bahamas Defence Force Rangers.\n\nPeacekeeping missions have been conducted with the participation of RBDF members in El Salvador and Haiti.\n\n\nThe main ships in the force are two \"Bahamas\"-class and four \"Legend\"-class offshore patrol vessels. The latter are the first part of the nine-vessel acquisition contract signed with the Damen Shipyards Group in April 2013.\nMost of the missions consist of anti-poaching patrols, anti-drug patrols, immigration enforcement, search and rescue, or general National Defence missions.\n\nFour of the new vessels will be Stan 4207 design, four of the new vessels will be Stan 3007 design, and the final vessel will be landing craft style transport craft, Damen Stan Lander 5612.\n\nThe Air Wing was formed on November 26, 1981, two years after the creation of the defence force. Initially three Aero Commanders were purchased from Bahamasair and operated, but these were sold off in 1990. In 1992, a Cessna 402 was added with a Cessna 421 soon after. By late 2005, the delivery of a Super king Air 350 took place. In May 2009, a Cessna 208 Turbine Caravan with floats and a Partenavia P.68 were delivered and significantly improved the RBDF's surveillance and transport capabilities.\n\n", "id": "7743916", "categories": ["Royal Bahamas Defence Force", "Military of the Bahamas"], "title": "Royal Bahamas Defence Force"}

Henry Taylor, and Mary Bowyer. They arrived at Shanghai on 5 November 1873. The following year, he and Mary Bowyer were married at Shanghai on 17 September 1874. Mary was a veteran missionary to China from the beginning of the China Inland Mission, who had ventured out with Hudson Taylor on the Lammermuir (clipper) in 1866. She had been baptised by Taylor, along with some others, en route at the Sunda Strait.\n\nBaller studied the Chinese language in Nanking (Nanjing), then just recently liberated from the ravages of the Taiping rebels. Baller was then appointed superintendent of missions in Anhui and Jiangsu with the China Inland Mission. He went to Shanxi in 1876 with George King to distribute famine relief. Again, due to the continued famine in 1878 he returned to Shanxi with Jane Elizabeth Faulding (Mrs. Hudson Taylor), the single women missionaries Horne and Crickmay. Baller took a China Inland Mission party through Hunan, facing antiforeign opposition, to Guiyang in 1880, visiting the capital of Guizhou. He was appointed secretary to the first China Inland Mission China Council in 1885.\nIn 1896 he was appointed principal of the new training home for CIM male missionaries at Anqing, Sichuan. There he not only helped train missionaries in the Chinese language but also published his lectures in \"Letters, from an Old Missionary to His Nephew\" (1907).\n\nIn 1887 he began his extensive literary work. From 1900 to 1918 he served on the committee to revise the Mandarin Bible as a member of the Union Mandarin Bible Revision Committee at Beijing, for the New Testament in 1907, and the Old Testament 1907–1918. Among his many books, the best known are \"An Anglo-Chinese Dictionary\", \"The Mandarin Primer\" (thirteen editions), \"An Idiom a Lesson, An Analytical Vocabulary of the New Testament\", \"Lessons in Wenli\", \"An English Translation of the Sacred Edict\", and \"The Life of Hudson Taylor\".\n\nAfter the death of his first wife, Baller married H.

It was in Ogden at the Golden Spike Rodeo where he rode his first bucking horse. \"It was a junior rodeo and it was not a full-sized horse, but it bucked and I stayed on. They gave me a buckle for an award ... first thing I ever won.\"\n\nWhen he grew older, he attended college. With the assistance of an intercollegiate rodeo scholarship, he attended Utah Valley Community College, now known as Utah Valley University, and Weber State University. At Utah Valley University, he qualified for the National High School Finals Rodeo three times. He also earned three National Finals appearances. Then, in 1980, with some assistance from friends, he turned professional.\n\nFeild competed on the PRCA rodeo circuit throughout his professional rodeo career. He was the World All-Around Cowboy Champion in 1985-87, and the World Bareback Riding Champion in 1985-86 at the NFR. He won the NFR All-Around Average in 1986-88. He won the NFR Average in Bareback Riding in 1984 and 1986. Feild became the first rough-stock cowboy since Larry Mahan to earn World All-Around titles since 1973. In 1980, he was the PRCA Resistol Rookie of the Year.\n\nIn the years 1981, 1988, and 1991, Feild won the Linderman Award. This award is given to the cowboy who works both ends of the arena (this means timed events on one side and rough-stock on the other side) and has the highest earnings. Feild was also an established team roper.\n\nIn 1987, Feild took the record for single-season earnings in the bareback bronc event to $114,657. In that same year, he also set a new single rodeo earnings record of $75,219. He held the record for single-season arena earnings until 1986 until Ty Murray set a new record of $213,771. In 1990, Feild was the first rough-stock contestant to win more than $1 million in his career in the PRCA. He was the third cowboy to do it at any level. Tom Ferguson did it first and Roy Cooper did it second.\n\nAccording to many personnel, Feild was a staple at the Ogden Pioneer Days rodeo in Ogden, Utah, for as long as they can remember. The committee made him the focus of an opening act which lasted around 10 years up until his death. He was such an icon to the rodeo that it inducted him into its Utah Cowboy Hall of Fame. It also recognized him as the Utah County honoree for the National Day of the American Cowboy. Each of these two honors were awarded to Feild inaugurally in Ogden.\n\n\"Someday, when rodeo people look back at what I've done, I'd like them to say these things: that I rode tough; I could ride with pain and courage; that I was a fierce competitor in the arena, but a quiet, respectable man outside the gate. I just want to be remembered as a cowboy,\" said the soft-spoken champion. \"That probably says it all.\"\n\nHe coached the UVSC rodeo team and lived in Elk Ridge, Utah with his wife Veronica. He has three children and seven grandchildren. \n\nFeild died of pancreatic cancer on February 15, 2016, in Elk Ridge, Utah at the age of 59 after battling stage 4 pancreatic cancer. His son Kaycee Feild won four World Bareback Bronc Champion titles at the NFR from 2011 to 2014.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7743956", "categories": ["Deaths from cancer in Utah", "2016 deaths", "ProRodeo Hall of Fame inductees", "1956 births", "Sportspeople from Utah", "All-Around", "People from Summit County, Utah", "Roping (rodeo)", "Deaths from pancreatic cancer", "People from Utah County, Utah", "Bareback bronc riders"], "title": "Lewis Feild"}

It aired on February 10, 1999, featuring characters from Disney's \"Aladdin\" franchise including, Aladdin, Princess Jasmine, Jafar and Abu.\n\nAs Hades goes through his usual job of bringing fresh souls in, Pain and Panic tell him that one of the souls is not cooperating. The soul in question, Jafar, approaches Hades and demands to be sent back. Hades is at first unconcerned, but they find a common ground: Jafar tried to overtake Agrabah, Hades is trying to overtake Mount Olympus, and they both have been defeated by \"upstart boys\". They make a bet that they can defeat each other's respective nemesis, and Hades gives Jafar a new snake staff, which turns him into a mortal as long as it remains in his possession. Then he orders Jafar to attack Hercules while he's training on Philoctetes's island.\n\nAt said island, Phil is trying to teach Hercules not to use just his strength, but also his brains from time to time. Jafar appears and summons several monsters to go after Hercules. Jafar initially gains the upper hand until Hercules picks up Phil's \"statue head\" house, bashes the beasts and proceeds to smash it on Jafar, who gets knocked back to the Underworld. Hades then decides to send Pain and Panic to Agrabah to take Aladdin out. When the minions arrive in the Arabian city, they first mistake Abu for Aladdin, but the real Aladdin, along with his wife Jasmine, arrives on Carpet. After a scuffle, Pain and Panic are about to finish Aladdin off, but Aladdin convinces them to look into his lamp (by telling them not to look into it), and Genie's hand punches them all the way back into the Underworld.\n\nWith this humiliating double defeat, Jafar offers the idea of getting Hercules and Aladdin into fighting and killing each other. Hades likes the idea and puts the plan into motion by kidnapping Abu from Agrabah and Icarus from Prometheus Academy. When Hercules can't find Icarus, an old man (Jafar in disguise) fools him by telling him that a \"young rogue named Aladdin\" kidnapped him. Later, in Agrabah, Aladdin and Jasmine are led to believe by Pain and Panic (disguised as Hercules) that Hercules kidnapped Abu.\n\nWhen Hercules, Phil and Pegasus arrive in Agrabah, Aladdin, Jasmine and Carpet engage them. Aladdin gets Hercules to chase him through the alleyways of Agrabah to an old abandoned building and to punch enough holes in the walls to bring most of the house down on top of Hercules. While Hercules holds it up, Aladdin demands to know where he hid Abu; Hercules responds by wanting to know where Aladdin took Icarus. This leads Aladdin to realize they have been tricked, but before they can work it out, the building collapses on both of them. While Jafar and Hades believe that the heroes have been destroyed, Hercules gets himself and Aladdin out of the rubble. They piece together that they were set up and that Hades and Jafar are holding Icarus and Abu in the Underworld. Aladdin wants to charge in to rescue them, but Hercules thinks of another way.\n\nAs Hades tells Jafar of his plans for Olympian domination (and offers Jafar the 'Lord of the Dead' title in his stead), Pain and Panic yell alert them to Hercules and Aladdin's impending arrival. Jafar is sent to stop them; but acting on an idea by Hercules, he and Aladdin have swapped their identities, fooling Jafar into engaging them with the wrong countermeasures. Jafar is unable to stop Aladdin from nabbing the snake staff and tossing it to Hercules, who snaps it in half. This effect turns Jafar back into a soul and pull him down into the River Styx for good. Icarus and Abu have in the meantime escaped and begin punching Hades, until he threatens to make them \"permanent residents\".\n\nHercules and Aladdin congratulate each other before Aladdin takes Jasmine, Abu and Carpet back to Agrabah, telling Hercules that he'll make a great hero someday. Icarus, having bonded with Abu, asks Hercules if they can get a monkey.\n\n\nAn unusual aspect of this episode is that it indicates that Aladdin and Hercules existed around the same time, though one would logically conclude that they lived at least a millennium apart (Hercules being from ancient Greece, while Aladdin is from the era of the Islamic empires, probably of Abbasid Caliphate). On the other hand, some of Aladdin's enemies, such as Mechanicles, Queen Hippsodeth and Dominus Tusk, could easily be the same vintage as Hercules. Also during the \"A Whole New World\" part in the original 1992 film, Aladdin and Jasmine can be seen riding through what could be Greece. Another thing to note is that in \"The Return of Jafar\", Genie states that he raced with Hercules.\n\nPrincess Jasmine mentions that she and Aladdin are married, indicating this episode takes place after the events of \"Aladdin and the King of Thieves\", which would explain Iago's absence in this episode and also explain why Aladdin has the same outfit on which he wore in \"Aladdin and the King of Thieves\", this is additionally backed up by the fact that Aladdin appears physically older than his last appearance. This is a bit strange, though, since the episode seems to indicate that Jafar died recently, though there was an entire movie, and indeed a TV series, between his death in \"The Return of Jafar\" and this episode. It is possible that time passed differently in the underworld and that Jafar had to go through a waiting line before meeting up with Hades, as it is mentioned in many ancient texts (such as Virgil's \"Aeneid\") that souls have to wait a long time to cross the river.\n", "id": "7743964", "categories": ["Aladdin (franchise)", "Crossover animation", "Hercules (franchise)", "1999 American television episodes"], "title": "Hercules and the Arabian Night"}

He was King Alfred Professor of English at Liverpool University. He also helped set up the Department of English at the University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nBorn at Holt, Norfolk, on 3 June 1861, Elton was the only child of Sarah and the Reverend Charles Allen Elton (1820–1887), the headmaster of Gresham's School, where Oliver was taught by his father until he proceeded to Marlborough College and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was a scholar from 1880 to 1885. He graduated with a BA with first class honours in \"Literae Humaniores\" in 1884.\n\nHis friends at Oxford included Leonard Huxley, Michael Sadler and Dugald Sutherland MacColl, whose sister he later married.\n\nElton's first work was as a tutor and lecturer in London, while preparing school editions of Shakespeare and Milton. He translated Einar Hafliðason's \"Laurentius Saga\" as \"The Life of Laurence Bishop of Hólar in Iceland\" (Lárentíus Kálfsson) into English. In this he was encouraged by Frederick York Powell, whose biography Elton would later publish in 1906.\n\nIn 1890 he went as a lecturer to Owens College, Manchester, remaining for ten years. During his time there he published a translation of nine of the books of the \"Gesta Danorum\" by \"Saxo Grammaticus\", a study of Michael Drayton, and \"The Augustan Ages\" (1899) which brought him recognition from the academic literary world. Meanwhile, he got to know Charles Edward Montague and wrote for the \"Manchester Guardian\".\n\nHe went to Liverpool in 1901 as Professor of English Literature and stayed till his retirement in 1925. While there, he completed two thirds (four volumes) of his \"Survey of English Literature\" and lectured and wrote on Milton, Tennyson, Henry James, Chekhov and others.\n\nAfter retirement he went to Harvard as a visiting professor and later settled in Oxford. He completed the \"Survey of English Literature\", and published a book on English poetry: \"The English Muse: a Sketch\" (1933). He also continued an interest in Russian and other Slavic literature (mainly Serbian) which had begun during the first world war, and published further translations, notably of Pushkin's Eugene Onegin (1937).\n\nElton's encyclopedic range is impressive and George Sampson, in the \"Cambridge History of English Literature\", brackets him with two of his contemporaries who were also \"scholars on the heroic scale of learning \": William Paton Ker and George Saintsbury.\n\nIn 1888 Elton married Letitia Maynard MacColl, the sister of his Oxford friend Dugald Sutherland MacColl. Letitia became a children's writer.

Twentieth Television produced 63 episodes to air weekdays. The limited-run serial was directed by Terry Cunningham, Dennis Dimster, P. David Ebersole, Jeff Hare and Jeremy Stanford. It focuses on a bitter, obsessed woman's vendetta against her former lover. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has not announced plans to release this series on DVD and/or Blu-ray.\n\nThis romantic melodrama starred Tatum O'Neal as Blythe Hunter, a beautiful scorned woman, whose boyfriend Theodore Crawford (Clive Robertson) left her twenty-five years ago to marry someone else. As revenge, she decides to destroy him by grooming her two sons to marry his two daughters and take over The Tides, a racetrack in Del Mar, California. She wreaks havoc on the Crawfords, but the plan doesn't go the way she had hoped.\n\n\"Wicked Wicked Games\" also starred David Smith and Jack Krizmanich as Blythe's sons, Josh and Aaron, respectively. Josh is a doctor who gets manipulated into Blythe's schemes by the more \"wicked\" son Aaron. Jessie Ward and Kate French played Emma and Brooke respectively, the Crawford daughters.\n\nBlythe approaches Aaron to pose as \"Daniel Karol\" and help her undermine Theodore and take control of the Tides. Blythe also employs her lawyer, Benjamin Grey to help her do her dirty work. Aaron quickly gets the job, and begins to work for Theo. Only Taylor Burns, CFO of the Tides, is suspicious of him. Over the show's first month, Emma gets engaged to the Tides lawyer Edward (who is cheating on her with secretary Jennifer), Brooke quickly falls for Daniel, and Blythe reveals herself to Theo, and tries to rekindle the flame between them, steaming Theo's girlfriend, Hope Lorca, who raised Brooke and Emma after their mother's death, and was the family housekeeper.\n\nSoon, Emma makes a startling discovery- that Theo is not Brooke and herself's real father, but her late mother, Anna had a lover named Gavin. She confronts Theo and Madeline, Theo's sister, who confirm the truth. Madeline indulges in cyber romance with \"Phillipe\", who she confides in. Lani Walker, Blythe's assistant, falls for Taylor, and is shocked by the lengths her boss is going to. Blythe loves to torture Lani, and she soon begins to undermine Blythe, a huge mistake on her part. Theo is soon on to Blythe. Blythe is thrilled to learn that Theo may be planning to propose to her, but instead proposes to Hope, which soon pleases Blythe, realizing that he will be too busy planning a wedding to notice his business being taken from him. Not too much later, Blythe takes over the Tides, and throws Theo out. She takes pride in revealing that \"Daniel\" is her son, Aaron, which also stuns Brooke. Theo is devastated, and turns to alcohol for comfort. Jennifer wants Edward to leave Emma, and Edward's obsession with Emma grows, as Emma continues to fall for Josh. Taylor ends things with Lani after realizing that she was aware of what Blythe was planning, and Lani is devastated. Brooke continues on a downward spiral with alcohol and drugs. She soon learns that her father, Gavin died several years ago, and nearly dies from an overdose.\n\nTension had been mounting between Theo and Hope following the loss of the Tides, and Hope decides to leave town for a while. Madeline asks her to stay and work things out, but Hope thinks it is for the best. She has a final encounter with Blythe, when Blythe strangles her to death. Blythe makes it look as though Hope completely vanished, and left Theo. Blythe continues with the second stage of the plan, getting her hands on the Crawford estate. Blythe reveals to Theo that Josh and Aaron are his sons and that she was pregnant when he left her for Anna. \"Why, because he's your son?\" Theo asks. \"No, because he's yours.\" Blythe reveals in front of Aaron. Aaron and Brooke as well as Josh and Emma do eventually get together because Brooke and Emma are their stepsisters and they are their stepbrothers because they're Theo's sons just like they're Anna's daughters with her lover Gavin. It's revealed that Blythe is bipolar and has another personality who she created after Theo left her pregnant with their sons.\n\nThis serial was derived from a 1998 Venezuelan series, \"Aunque me Cueste la Vida\" (\"Though It Might Cost Me My Life\"). In it, Julie Restifo played the vengeful mother, who was named Belgica Michelena. Production began in July 2006 and continued for six days a week over four months. Tatum O'Neal openly complained about the grueling schedule.\n\nThe show was originally intended to run in syndication as \"Art of Betrayal\" under the \"Desire\" umbrella title. The \"Desire\" logo appeared during the opening credits and MyNetworkTV's website listed the serial as \"part of the Desire series\". Sean Young and Gordon Thomson were originally signed for the lead roles played by Tatum O'Neal and Clive Robertson. Actress Jessie Ward played Penelope Sayers on another MyNetworkTV telenovela, \"Desire.\"\n\nThe theme song for this series is \"Think Again\" by Blond Mafia. Recap shows originally aired on Saturdays but were replaced by movies on February 3, 2007. While Harper Entertainment announced plans to publish a book called \"Wicked, Wicked Games: The Diary of Blythe Hunter\", it has not been released. The Del Mar Racetrack was used for race track location shooting. Other scenes were filmed at Stu Segall Productions in San Diego.\n\n", "id": "7743982", "categories": ["Television series by 20th Century Fox Television", "2000s American television series", "MyNetworkTV shows", "American telenovelas", "2006 American television series debuts", "2007 American television series endings", "2006 telenovelas", "2007 telenovelas", "American television series based on telenovelas"], "title": "Wicked Wicked Games"}

During the 1960s, the New York crime families imported young Sicilian men from Sicily to the United States to work as drug traffickers and hitmen. American mobsters soon derisively dubbed the Sicilians \"Zips\" due to their fast speech. Bonanno boss Carmine Galante brought Bonventre to New York to be his bodyguard. Bonventre soon became the unofficial underboss of the Bonanno family Sicilians. Bonventre's uncle was John Bonventre, a former Bonanno underboss. Bonventre was also a cousin of the first family boss Joseph Bonanno and Bonanno mobster Baldassare \"Baldo\" Amato. In 1979, Cesare and Baldassare were arrested for carrying illegal firearms in their car after being stopped by police at the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream, New York, shortly before the execution of Carmine Galante. In April 1981, they were convicted and served two months. Ralph Blumenthal wrote in \"Last Days of the Sicilians: The FBI's War Against the Mafia\" that Cesare identified himself to law enforcement as \"a pizza man from Brooklyn\".\n\nHe was a regular habituate of his cousin Baldassare Amato's deli run by his family located at Second Avenue and Eighty-fourth Street in Yorkville, New York. The deli had burned down not long before January 1984 but in its place the Amato family built an apartment building with a sleek Italian cafe and restaurant called Biffi. Bonventre's moniker was \"The Tall Guy\" because he stood close to six feet seven inches tall. Lean and handsome, Bonventre frequented clubs such as \"The Toyland Social Club\" and the Knickerbocker Avenue area with other Sicilian mobsters. In the book \"King of the Godfathers\", Anthony M. Destefano writes that there was something about Bonventre that made him stand out from the other ethnic Italians. His stylish clothing, aviator sunglasses and European man purses embodied Italian couture. Bonventre normally wore his shirt unbuttoned with a gold crucifix hanging from his neck.\n\nGalante was allegedly murdered for not sharing his drug trafficking profits with the family. The hit on Galante required Philip \"Rusty\" Rastelli to get approval from the Zips, Gambino crime family boss Paul Castellano and the other Commission bosses. It was later rumored that the Mafia Commission, which oversees all the crime families, had sanctioned Galante's murder and arranged for Bonventre and Baldo, Galante's bodyguards, to betray him.\n\nOn July 12, 1979, Bonventre allegedly participated in the murders of Galante and two of his friends. He had been dropped off for lunch at Joe & Mary's; an Italian restaurant in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. After a short while, bodyguards Bonventre and Baldo Amato joined Galante. Although it was a hot summer day and they were dining on the patio, both Bonventre and Amato wore leather jackets; presumably to protect themselves from stray bullets and debris. Suddenly, three men in ski masks appeared on the patio and opened fire on Galante. Bonventre and Amato allegedly joined in the attack, then disappeared from the scene after the three hitmen. Galante and his two lunch companions died. A week after the Galante murders, Bonventre was arrested by federal agents, but he was soon released and was never charged with the crime.\n\nPhilip \"Rusty\" Rastelli succeeded Galante as boss of the family, even though he was incarcerated at the time and Joseph Massino became underboss. Although some believed Massino was the real power in the family. After Galante's death, Bonventre was promoted from soldier to capo and joined Salvatore Catalano's Brooklyn crew. At 28, Bonventre became the youngest capo in Bonanno family history. Bonventre became involved in the importation and drug trafficking of heroin from Sicily into New York pizza parlors, known as the \"Pizza Connection\".\n\nBonventre had been on the side of the three capos' Alphonse \"Sonny Red\" Indelicato, Philip Giaccone and Dominick Trinchera; a family faction who were planning a coup to take over the family. However, Bonventre switched sides, joining Rastelli's faction. If Bonventre and the Zips had stayed loyal to Indelicato, he would have probably taken over the Bonanno family. The ascension of Rastelli as boss triggered a period of discontent and rivalry in the Bonanno family. As a result, Rastelli and Massino started purging their opponents in the family.\n\nIn 1984, Massino decided to eliminate Bonventre. Bonventre's pedigree, increasing wealth and fearsome reputation had made him into a threat to Massino's leadership. Bonventre controlled the Sicilians, the meanest killers in the family. Bonventre himself was prone to outbursts of sadistic violence and was suspected of over 20 murders. Massino warned, \"He's a very sharp guy. You have to be careful.\"\n\nIn April 1984, Bonanno mobsters Salvatore Vitale and Louis Attanasio picked up Bonventre to bring him to a meeting with Rastelli at a glue factory in Wallington, New Jersey. As Vitale drove the car into the factory, Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head. Surprisingly, Bonventre still struggled; grabbing the steering wheel and trying to crash the car, forcing the two hitmen to fight him off. As Vitale steered into the garage, Bonventre crawled out of the car. Louis Attanasio then killed him on the garage floor with two more shots. Bonventre's body was hacked to pieces and dumped into three 55-gallon glue drums. The killers then moved the drums to the fourth floor offices of a trading company in Garfield, New Jersey.\n\nOn April 9, 1984, unaware that Bonventre was dead, a federal grand jury indicted him and 12 other men on charges of distributing narcotics through the pizza restaurants - the so-called \"Pizza Connection\" case. On April 17, 1984, Bonventre's body was recovered. FBI agents searching the trading company offices for stolen goods discovered the three drums. After the body was recovered, it took forensic technicians three months to identify it. Bonventre is buried at Saint Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York. Bonventre's widow gave birth to their only son after the murder.\n\nSoon after the murder, a government informant later claimed that one of Bonventre's killers was Bonanno mobster Cosimo Aiello. However, in October 1984, Aiello was shot to death in the parking lot of a Clifton, New Jersey restaurant. In January 2004, nearly 20 years after the Bonventre murder, federal authorities arrested Louis Attanasio, Peter Calabrese and Louis's brother, Robert Attanasio. Now a government witness, Vitale testified against them. On September 20, 2006, after being convicted of murder, Louis Attanasio and Calabrese were sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Robert Attanasio, who had cleaned up the murder car, received 10 years imprisonment.\n\n", "id": "7744122", "categories": ["1951 births", "Murdered American mobsters of Sicilian descent", "1984 deaths", "Deaths by firearm in New Jersey", "People from Castellammare del Golfo", "Sicilian Mafiosi", "People murdered by the Bonanno crime family", "American mobsters of Sicilian descent", "Bonanno crime family"], "title": "Cesare Bonventre"}

The organization advocates the implementation of safe, sustainable solutions such as energy efficiency, solar power, wind power and plug-in hybrids.\n\nAs of 2007, NIRS claims to initiate \"\"large-scale organizing and public education campaigns on specific issues,\"\" such as to \"\"bring technical expertise and strategic sense to grassroots environmental groups.\"\"\n\nIn 2000, NIRS' affiliation with World Information Service on Energy (WISE) turned it into an international organization (NIRS/WISE).\n\nThe magazine \"Nuclear Engineering International\" has said that it runs easily the best website on uranium mining throughout the world.\nSome of the policies endorsed by NIRS include strict controls on nuclear waste disposal, bans on nuclear weapons and new power plants. NIRS is opposed to ineffective nuclear waste reprocessing, unsafe transportation of nuclear waste, and the implementation of large-scale nuclear waste repositories like Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. NIRS also does not view nuclear energy as a remedy for climate change.\n\nNIRS and WISE have merged their operations and WISE has relay offices in Amsterdam, Argentina, Austria, the Czech Republic, India, Japan, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, and the Ukraine. The bi-weekly WISE News Communique merged with the NIRS Nuclear Monitor and covers the resistance movements working against nuclear power worldwide as well as chronicling the failings of the industry. Spanish, Russian and Ukrainian versions of this newsletter are also printed.\n\nMichael Mariotte (1952-2016) was president and executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service for 30 years. He was a well-known opponent of nuclear power and organised anti-nuclear activities in Europe after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Mariotte was a keen supporter of renewable energy and efficient energy use. He believed that nuclear power would become obsolete, to be replaced by clean energy sources.\n\nOn 15 May 2007, NIRS issued a report claiming that radioactive scrap, concrete, equipment, asphalt, plastic, wood, chemicals, and soil from U.S. nuclear weapons facilities are being released to regular landfills and could get into commercial recycling streams.\"\n\nOn 3 August 2004, NIRS issued a report stating that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission may allow the illegal practice of manually shutting down nuclear power plants in the event of fire.\n\nOn 17 July 2007, regarding the leakage of water from the spent fuel pool of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant after the 2007 Niigata earthquake, Michael Mariotte, spoke on behalf of the NIRS and commented \"The leak itself doesn't sound significant as of yet, but the fact that it went unreported is a concern, when a company begins by denying a problem, it makes you wonder if there's another shoe to drop.\"\n\nIn October 2010, Michael Mariotte, executive director of NIRS, predicted that the U.S. nuclear industry will not experience a nuclear renaissance, for the simple reason that “nuclear reactors make no economic sense”. The economic slump has driven down electricity demand and the price of competing energy sources, and Congress has failed to pass climate change legislation, making nuclear economics very difficult.\n\nNIRS counts the following celebrities among its supporters:\n\nCritics accuse NIRS of fearmongering, and question the qualifications of NIRS staff to adequately assess the safety of nuclear energy. Diane D’Arrigo, Radioactive Waste Project Director, lists no training in physics or radiological medicine which might qualify her for \"expertise is radioactive waste and radiation issues\".

For his service during the Napoleonic Wars, he was made a baron of the French Empire by Napoleon Bonaparte. During the November Uprising he commanded all Polish forces on the left bank of the Vistula River.\n\nBorn to a lesser szlachta family, Klicki started his military career in 1791, joining the ranks of the National Cavalry. He fought with distinction in the War of the Constitution. A skilled cavalryman, during the Kościuszko's Uprising of 1794 he became the \"governor of National Cavalry\" under Tadeusz Kościuszko. For his valour shown in the battles of Ostrołęka and Łasia, he was promoted to the rank of Captain of Cavalry. Soon afterwards he was attached to Gen. Zieliński. After the fall of the uprising he was forced to leave the country and settled in Italy.\n\nThere in 1797 he joined the Polish Legions in Italy and fought under command of Gen. Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. Klicki took part in the battles of Legnano, Castel Nuovo, Castel Franco and the battle of Naples. During the siege of Mantua in 1799 he was taken prisoner by the Austrians, but was released soon afterwards and returned to his unit. Promoted to the rank of Major, he became a commanding officer of the 5th Battalion. Soon afterwards, in 1800, he left the infantry and was among the first officers to be accepted in the newly formed 1st Uhlans' Regiment of the Legion.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars he fought with distinction in several campaigns. During the war against Prussia he took part in the battles of Świdnica, Glogau and Neisse. On July 1, 1807 he was again promoted, this time to the rank of podpułkownik (lieutenant colonel). In that rank he joined the Vistulan Legion and became the commander of the cavalry of that unit. With his men he took part in the Peninsular War and fought in the battles of Mallen, Alagon, Epila and Tudela. In the summer of 1808 he fought in the First Siege of Saragossa. Following the Siege of Valencia he was awarded by Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet with a private audience with Napoleon Bonaparte. The Emperor granted him a yearly reward of 2000 francs and a promotion to colonel. Considered a hero, in 1812 Klicki was made a Baron of the Empire.\n\nDuring the French invasion of Russia Klicki returned to front-line service and fought at battles of Smolensk, Vitebsk, Mozhaysk and Maloyaroslavets. During the retreat he was among the most successful commanders of the fleeing armies and managed to save almost all of his 4000 men, including viceroy of Italy Eugene Beauharnais. He found his way to Vilna, which he attempted to defend against the pursuing Russians. However, his attempt failed and Klicki retreated with his units further westwards. He then fought in the Saxon Campaign (at Köppen, Motzern, Dresden, Magdeburg and Möchern). On July 22, 1813 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and became the commanding officer of the 32nd Light Cavalry Brigade of the V Cavalry Corps under General Édouard Jean-Baptiste Milhaud. He led his brigade in the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813. He moved to France and fought in the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube in 1814. However, the abdication of Napoleon stopped his military career in the French forces.\n\nHe resigned his post and returned to Congress Poland, where he joined the army and became the commanding officer of the 2nd Brigade of Mounted Rifles. In 1817 he was nominated the commanding officer of the entire division, but for unknown reasons the document was handed to him only in 1826. He set up his staff in Łowicz. There he greeted the outbreak of the November Uprising. Together with his division he arrived to Warsaw and subordinated himself to the Provisional Government and General Józef Chłopicki. Following the latter's resignation, Klicki briefly served as a deputy Commander-in-Chief and since December 18, 1830, was a member of the War Council. As his support for the uprising was weak and his health was failing, in 1831 he resigned his post and was allowed to leave Poland for Bavaria, where he intended to settle. However, on crossing the Austrian border he was arrested and handed over to the Russians, who imprisoned him and resettled to Kostroma. Released in 1836, he spent the rest of his life in sanatoria. Stanisław Klicki died April 23, 1847 in Rome, and was buried at the Campo Verano cemetery.\n", "id": "7744274", "categories": ["Polish generals", "1847 deaths", "Generals of the November Uprising", "Polish commanders of the Napoleonic Wars", "1775 births"], "title": "Stanisław Klicki"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7744284", "text": "County Route 16 (Suffolk County, New York)\n\nCounty Route 16 (CR 16) is a main thoroughfare through central Suffolk County, New York, in the United States. Its western terminus is at Middle Country Road (New York State Route 25 or NY 25) in Smithtown, on the eastern border of the Village of the Branch, and its eastern terminus is at Montauk Highway (CR 80) in Brookhaven near Southhaven. The route carries five different names along its length.\n\nCR 16 begins as Terry Road at an intersection with NY 25. From NY 25, the road runs to the south near a former concrete factory. It then crosses NY 347. Several blocks south of NY 347, CR 16 joins Smithtown Boulevard, while Terry Road continues to run south as a road maintained by the Town of Smithtown, and crosses the Islip town line into Ronkonkoma. A former section of Terry Road exists near NY 25A. It is unknown how this section connected to the present terminus of Terry Road at NY 25 while traversing the surrounding terrain.\n\nOf the five roads shared by CR 16, Smithtown Boulevard is the only road completely controlled by Suffolk County. Not only are there no former sections, but there are no sections of the road that branch off as local streets. Smithtown Boulevard goes from Smithtown, through Nesconset where it serves as the hamlet's main street, and eventually terminates in Lake Ronkonkoma east of CR 93 (Rosevale Avenue). At one time, CR 76 (Town Line Road) was proposed to curve north of the Smithtown–Islip town line, and terminate between Old Nichol's Road (not to be confused with CR 97, named Nicolls Road) and Rosevale Avenue.\n\nAlong the north and east side of Lake Ronkonkoma is a road known as Lake Shore Drive, the northern portion of which consists mostly of CR 16, except between Spectacle Lake Road and Schoolhouse Road, which is maintained by the Town of Smithtown. The east end of this section near Schoolhouse Road has suffered such excessive flooding that it was closed by Suffolk County and turned over to the Parks Department, while the rest of it was sold to a local night club on the lake and transformed into part of the parking lot. East of Schoolhouse Road however, the road crosses the Smithtown–Brookhaven town line and runs high along the bluffs of Lake Ronkonkoma until it reaches Portion Road. CR 16 moves east onto Portion Road while Lake Shore Drive continues south along the lake as a road maintained by the Town of Brookhaven.\n\nPortion Road begins at the intersection of Lake Shore Drive. Old Portion Road is a former section of Portion Road located just south of that intersection. Through Lake Ronkonkoma and western Farmingville, CR 16 crawls eastward in a hilly region of Long Island, as it intersects with Ronkonkoma Avenue, Hawkins Avenue, CR 19 (Patchogue–Holbrook Road), and Holbrook Road before reaching an interchange with CR 97 (Nicolls Road), where the road opens up to four lanes. Suffolk County is currently planning to widen the rest of the road to four lanes. This section of CR 16 once carried the additional name of Farm-to-Market Road.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Horseblock Road is the main section of CR 16. Like Portion Road, it once shared the additional name of Farm-to-Market Road. Unlike the rest of CR 16, Horseblock Road's western terminus is at Middle Country Road (NY 25) in Centereach. Originally, Horseblock Road was connected to another street a few blocks west of the current terminus named Mark Tree Road. The two sections formed a single road that ran from South Setauket to South Haven. The connection between the two streets are cut off by a shopping center on the north side of NY 25 between Mark Tree and Eastwood Road. It then traverses to the south-southeast, and is cut off by CR 97 (Nicolls Road), Suffolk County Community College, and other county facilities in Farmingville, and joins up with Portion Road from a frontage road west of Nicolls Road named Leeds Boulevard at the interchange with Nicolls Road. The section east of Nicolls Road resumes at Horseblock Place and then joins Portion Road west of Waverly Avenue.\n\nHorseblock Road then travels east-southeast through Farmingville (home of the historic Bald Hill Schoolhouse and Cotten Coverage Insurance Agency), intersecting Blue Point Road, Granny Road, and CR 83 (North Ocean Avenue) and then narrows down to two lanes eventually entering Medford, intersecting NY 112, the Long Island Expressway at exit 65, and CR 101 (Patchogue–Yaphank Road). It then enters southern Yaphank and Brookhaven, where it intersects CR 99 (Woodside Avenue, a road whose construction in the early 1970s lead to Horseblock Road's realignment) and then CR 21 (Yaphank Avenue), where it shares an interchange with Sunrise Highway (NY 27) before terminating at CR 80 (Montauk Highway) in Brookhaven.\n\nThe segment between Ronkonkoma and South Haven was built by the Works Progress Administration and gave the Portion Road and Horse Block Road southeast of Portion the dual name of \"Farm to Market Road,\" in the hopes of giving farmers of southeastern Long Island an accessible road to western segments of Long Island. \n\nThough CR 16 has run consistently from Smithtown to Brookhaven since the mid-1960s, this wasn't always the case. Many segments have been part of other county roads.\n\nEast Lake Shore Terrace Drive and Portion Road used to be part of CR 19 from the Smithtown–Brookhaven Town Line to Waverly Avenue in Farmingville. In 1960, this terminus was moved to Patchogue–Holbrook Road.\nThe construction of Sunrise Highway in 1957 lead to the realignment of Horseblock Road west of its original eastern terminus with South Country Road (former Montauk Highway) in South Haven. Because the interchange is shared with CR 21, the new alignment was originally designated as CR 21A.\nHorseblock Road used to be a western extension of CR 56 between Victory Avenue, a frontage road along Sunrise Highway that begins at CR 46, in Brookhaven and Waverly Avenue in Farmingville. In 1964, it was moved only to Victory Avenue. The frontage road was mainly unmarked until the 2010's.\n\n", "id": "7744284", "categories": [], "title": "County Route 16 (Suffolk County, New York)"}

During his stint with the Red Warriors in the UAAP, he became an instant hardcourt and campus icon as he teamed up with the highly touted scoring ace James Yap.

He was eventually picked by expansion team Blackwater Elite during the 2014 PBA Expansion Draft.\n\nAside from being a professional basketball player, Artadi has an online business, which he named Pimp Kicks, selling basketball shoes online through his Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nOn October 13, 2015, Artadi announced his retirement from professional basketball to shift his focus to politics. He ran as city councilor of San Juan City in the 2016 local elections under the ticket of Vice Mayor Francis Zamora, who ran for Mayor. May 10.

On the way there, \"Cherub\" and detained the Danish ship \"Neptunus\" on 30 August. \"Cherub\" sent \"Neptune\" (or \"Neptunus\"), which had been sailing from Stockholm to Holstein, into Sheerness. Slightly earlier, she supported the Swedes at the defence of Stralsund and Rügen.\n\nOn 29 February 1808 \"Cherub\" sailed for the Leeward Islands. From April to mid-June 1808 \"Cherub\" and cruised in company, and agreed to share any prizes they captured. Around 9 May \"Cherub\" captured the privateer schooner \"Vaillante\", Dubois, master, which was armed with swivel guns and small arms. Her crew abandoned her and escaped ashore, leaving behind one man who was sick and who died the next day. \"Cherub\" and \"Nimrod\" then used the schooner as a tender. On 17 May \"Nimrod\" captured a Spanish schooner carrying hides, cocoa, and indigo. She was the \"Esther\", sailing from La Guayra to Teneriffe. Lastly, on 22 May, \"Cherub\" and \"Nimrod\" jointly captured a Spanish letter of marque brig after a brief exchange of fire when the British sent in a boarding party in boats after her crew had run her ashore. She was armed with two guns and four howitzers but her crew abandoned her before the boarding party arrived. She had been carrying a cargo of cocoa from Cumano to Barcelona when the British intercepted her. The British were able to retrieve her, though not without difficulty. \"Nimrod\" then took the prizes into St Thomas. There the estimates were that the brig's cargo was worth about $20,000, and the Spanish schooner about $1200.\n\nOn 20 November , , \"Cherub\", , and participated in the capture of \"Bonetta\", \"Intrepid\", and \"Mary and Allen\". The last prize money was paid in 1839. In December Commander Thomas Tudor Tucker transferred from to take command of \"Cherub\".\n\nOn 23 January 1809 Captain William Maude of returned to his station off Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe, where he had left \"Cherub\" to watch the French frigate that was taking shelter there.\n\n\"Cherub\" then took part in the invasion of Martinique as part of the force under Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane and Lieutenant-General George Beckwith, who collected 29 ships and 10,000 men. \"Cherub\" and carried a detachment of troops from the 63rd Regiment of Foot which they disembarked at Corbet and which marched on St Pierre. The British force overwhelmed the French defenders at Martinique in February. Ultimately, 42 British warships shared in the prize money for Martinique. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \"Martinique\" to all surviving claimants from the campaign.\n\nIn early June 1809 \"Cherub\" and sailed into the anchorage at Basse-Terre to cut out two French frigates lying there under the protection of a fort and some batteries. As they sailed in they were subject to fire from shore batteries, which had no effect. The wind suddenly failed the British vessels, which were nevertheless able to extricate themselves from the situation with no losses or damage, but no success either.\n\nOn 18 June and \"Cherub\" captured one of the French frigates, . At the time of her capture, \"Félicité\" was armed with only 14 guns, but had 174 men on board. She had left Guadeloupe in company with another frigate and was sailing to France with colonial produce. The second frigate escaped through superior sailing despite \"Cherub\" having conducted a long chase. captured the second frigate, , on 5 July 1809. \"Latona\" and \"Cherub\" shared the prize money with the other vessels that had formed the blockade of the Saintes, \"Amaranthe\", \"Blonde\", , , \"Julia\", and .\n\nNext, \"Cherub\" took part in the invasion of Guadeloupe in early 1810. This time 50 vessels shared in the prize money. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \"Guadaloupe\" to all surviving claimants from the campaign.\n\nOn 1 August 1811 Tucker received promotion to post captain. \"Cherub\" was reclassed as a sixth rate to permit him to continue in command.\n\n\"Cherub\" remained on the Leeward Islands station until 3 July 1812, when she returned to England for a refit. On this voyage she convoyed some 70 to 80 vessels, or 96. \"Cherub\" arrived in September and the crew received one month's leave; apparently all returned to duty, even though they had been away from Britain for some years and expected to sail again for more years abroad. A newspaper report dated 9 October from Halifax reported that \"Prince of Asturias\", from St Mary's, Straker, master, which \"Cherub\" had recaptured, had arrived there. The account did not specify either the date of recapture nor arrival.\n\nOn 19 December 1812 \"Cherub\" left Cork with a convoy of 12 vessels, eight for Brazil, two for Buenos Aires, and one for the South Seas. Several separated and on 12 January captured \"Volunteer\" and the next day another vessel from the convoy. Still, on 24 January 1813 \"Cherub\" still had seven vessels with her.\n\n\"Cherub\" sailed from Rio de Janeiro on 8 July in company with and , sailing around Cape Horn.\n\nThe Royal Navy had been under pressure from the Montreal–based North West Company, who were agitating for them to capture the base of their rival, the Pacific Fur Company. At the Galapagos Islands, \"Racoon\" continued on to attack American fur traders at Fort Astoria on the Columbia River, while \"Phoebe\" and \"Cherub\" remained to search for the frigate , which had been attacking the British whaling fleet in the Pacific.\n\nOn 8 February 1814, \"Phoebe\" and \"Cherub\" found \"Essex\" at Valparaiso. They waited off the port for \"Essex\" to come out. On the afternoon of 28 March, \"Essex\" sailed but she lost her main topmast and anchored near the shore. \"Phoebe\" and \"Cherub\" also anchored and opened fire. The British were armed with long guns, which were more effective at a longer range than the American armament of carronades. As the British anchored out of effective range of the American carronades, the battle was very one-sided and lasted for an hour until Captain David Porter of \"Essex\" struck his colours with 23 dead and 42 wounded on board. On the British ships only five were killed. \"Phoebe\" and \"Cherub\" also captured \"Essex\"s tender, , which they then used as a cartel to transport their prisoners to New York. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasps \"Cherub 28 March 1814\" and \"Phoebe 28 March 1814\" to all surviving claimants from the battle.\n\nOn 31 May \"Phoebe\" and \"Essex\" set sail for England, finally anchoring in Plymouth sound on 13 November. The Admiralty repaired \"Essex\", taking her into service as HMS \"Essex\".\n\nIn mid-April \"Cherub\" was at Valparaiso taking on supplies. She was planning to sail to the Marquesas Islands in search of the whalers that \"Essex\" had captured.\n\nOn 12 June, near the Sandwich Islands, \"Cherub\" recaptured (or \"Sir Andrew Hamond\"); five days later she captured \"Charon\". \"Sir Andrew Hamond\" was a whaler that Porter had captured and left at Nuka Hiva, together with other captured whalers, including \"Greenwich\" and the former British letter-of-marque whaler, USS \"Seringapatam\", the whole being under the command of Lieutenant John M. Gamble USMC. When Gamble made preparations to leave the island, many of his party mutinied. Gamble and seven men (four unfit for duty) escaped and sailed \"Sir Andrew Hammond\" 2500 miles before they had the misfortune to meet up with \"Cherub\".\n\nOn 15 January 1815 \"Cherub\" and \"Racoon\" left Rio de Janeiro, escorting a convoy that included the storeships and , and seven merchantmen, including \"Sir Andrew Hammond\". They left Pernambuco on 6 March, and \"Cherub\" arrived at Portsmouth on 5 May.\n\n\"Cherub\" was fitted for sea at Portsmouth between August and October 1816. Captain William Fisher commissioned her in August for the West Africa Squadron.\n\nOn 17 January 1817, \"Cherub\" captured the Spanish slave ship \"Esperanza\". On 5 March, captured the slave ship \"Temerario\"; \"Cherub\" shared the prize money for \"Temerario\" with \"Bann\".\n\nIn May 1817 \"Cherub\" was at Cape Coast Castle, having come from London via Jamaica. In July she was back at Jamaica from Africa. She arrived back at Plymouth on 11 October.\n\nIn October 1817 she was recommissioned under Captain George Wicken Willes, who was appointed to her 3 October 1817 while she was fitting for Africa. On 15 May 1818, \"Cherub\" captured the Spanish slaver \"Josefa\" (or \"Joseffa\", or \"Josepha\"), Buenaventura Llarena, master, off Cape Appollonia. She had purchased 45 slaves, of whom some 35 were aboard, ten having been taken off shortly before \"Cherub\" captured her. \"Cherub\" sent her to Jamaica, then Havana, and finally back to Freetown, Sierra Leone, arriving 26 November. There \"Josefa\", which was in a leaky state, sank on 24 May 1819. She sank long after the 28 surviving slaves had been brought ashore. Although the vessel was clearly engaged in the illegal slave trade, she sank before the court condemned her. Willes had acted without having received instructions under the Treaty with Spain for the Suppression of Slave Trade and the seizure was not made under the Slave Trade Convention. The owner(s) sued Willes for the loss of their vessel and her cargo, winning a judgement of £21,180, which ruined Willes. An accounting of the costs and revenues of the colony at Sierra Leone shows £6740 14s 6d in income from \"Captain Willis of H.M.S. \"Cherub\"\" for an illegal capture.\n\n\"Cherub\" was back in Portsmouth on 5 October 1818, having sailed from Jamaica on 5 August and Havana on 15 September.\n\n\"Cherub\" was sold to Mr. Holmes for £940 on 13 January 1820.\n\n", "id": "7744359", "categories": ["Cormorant-class ship-sloops", "Ships built in Kent", "1806 ships", "War of 1812 ships of the United Kingdom"], "title": "HMS Cherub (1806)"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7744414", "text": "Customer attrition\n\nCustomer attrition, also known as customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.\n\nBanks, telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics (along with cash flow, EBITDA, etc.) because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.\n\nCompanies usually make a distinction between voluntary churn and involuntary churn. Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.\n\nWhen companies are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make the distinction between gross attrition and net attrition. Gross attrition is the loss of existing customers and their associated recurring revenue for contracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation, called Monthly Recurring Revenue (or MRR). In the 2000s, there are also a number of business intelligence software programs which can mine databases of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies. More sophisticated predictive analytics software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.\n\nFinancial services such as banking and insurance use applications of predictive analytics for churn modeling, because customer retention is an essential part of most financial services' business models. Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics, including retailing, telecommunications and pay-TV operators. One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors, so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future. Some companies want to prevent their \"good\" customers from deteriorating (e.g., by falling behind in their payments) and becoming less profitable customers, so they introduced the notion of partial customer churn.\n\nCustomer attrition merits special attention by mobile telecom service providers worldwide. This is due to the low barriers to switching to a competing service provider especially with the advent of Mobile Number Portability (MNP) in several countries. This allows customers to switch to another provider while preserving their phone numbers. While mature markets with high teledensity (phone market penetration) have churn rates ranging from 1% to 2% per month, high growth developing markets such as India and China are experiencing churn rates between 3% to 4% per month. By deploying new technologies such churn prediction models coupled with effective retention programs, customer attrition could be better managed to stem the significant revenue loss from defecting customers.\n\nCustomer attrition is a major concern for US and Canadian banks, because they have much higher churn rates than banks in Western Europe. US and Canadian banks with the lowest churn rates have achieved customer turnover rates as low as 12% per year, by using tactics such as free checking accounts, online banking and bill payment, and improved customer service. However, once banks can improve their churn rates by improving customer service, they can reach a point beyond which further customer service will not improve retention; other tactics or approaches need to be explored.\n\nChurn or Customer attrition is often used as an indicator of customer satisfaction. However the churn rate can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services. This can include ignoring resiliations requests, implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an average consumer and various other barriers to resiliation. Thus, churn can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates. This practice is short sighted and will backfire. However, it was shown to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers.\n\nScholars have studied customer attrition at European financial services companies, and investigated the predictors of churn and how the use of customer relationship management (CRM) approaches can impact churn rates. Several studies combine several different types of predictors to develop a churn model. This model can take demographic characteristics, environmental changes, and other factors into account.\n\nResearch on customer attrition data modeling may provide businesses with several tools for enhancing customer retention. Using data mining and software, one may apply statistical methods to develop nonlinear attrition causation models. One researcher notes that \"...retaining existing customers is more profitable than acquiring new customers due primarily to savings on acquisition costs, the higher volume of service consumption, and customer referrals.\" The argument is that to build an \"...effective customer retention program,\" managers have to come to an understanding of \"...why customers leave\" and \"...identify the customers with high risk of leaving\" by accurately predicting customer attrition.\n\nIn the business context, \"churn\" refers both to customers' migration and to their loss of value. So, \"churn rate\" refers, on the one hand, to the percentage of customers who end their relation with the organization, or, on the other hand, to the customers who still receive their services, but not as much or not as often as they used to.\nCurrent organizations face therefore a huge challenge: to be able to anticipate to customers’ abandon in order to retain them on time, reducing this way costs and risks and gaining efficiency and competitivity.\nThere are in the market advanced analytics tools and applications, especially designed to analyze in depth the enormous amount of data inside the organizations, and to make predictions based on the information obtained from analyzing and exploring those data. They aim to put at the service of marketing departments and agencies –and of all business users- the necessary weapons to:\n\nThere are organizations that have developed international standards regarding recognition and sharing of global best practice in customer service in order to reduce customer attrition. The International Customer Service Institute has developed The International Customer Service Standard to strategically align organizations so they focus on delivering excellence in customer service, whilst at the same time providing recognition of success through a 3rd Party registration scheme.\n\nNot all customer attrition is bad. For many firms, it is useful and desirable that unprofitable customers should churn away. This is known as customer divestment of unprofitable customers. However, simply because a customer is unprofitable does not mean that the customer should be divested, because there are strategic reasons for retaining unprofitable customers.\n\n\n", "id": "7744414", "categories": ["Business intelligence"], "title": "Customer attrition"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7744425", "text": "Aarni\n\nAarni has been described as an avant-garde metal band from Finland, which consists primarily of Master Warjomaa and, occasionally, some session musicians. Although many sources claim the existence of other band members, these may be fictional characters (probably created by Warjomaa himself) and include a French count born in the 17th century (Count of Saint-Germain), a cartoon character with a T-shirt with Aarni's logo (Doomintroll) and an old woman (Mistress Palm).\n\nAarni's music bears similarities to funeral doom metal (in \"Reaching Azathoth\", for example) and has sometimes similarities to folk metal (\"The Weird of Vipunen\"). Their style has been described as \"almost orthodox doom metallish Lovecraftian-Jungian Kalevala avantgarde music\". The band themselves sometimes use the term \"Chthonic Musick\". The lyrics of Aarni include varied themes such as Finnish folklore, transhumanism, Lovecraft, paganism, parapsychology, psychoanalytical theories and mythology. The lyrics have been sung in English, Finnish, Latin, and occasionally in Enochian, Ancient Egyptian, Ouranian Barbaric, Swedish, and Glossolalic.\n\nAarni was founded in 1998, in Finland, by Master Warjomaa (occasionally known as Mahatma M. Warjomaa). Master Warjomaa is also an active member of a doom metal band called Umbra Nihil, playing lead guitar. Aarni released a demo in 2001, and a split album with Umbra Nihil the following year. After a second demo in 2002, Aarni finally released its first full-length album, \"Bathos\", in 2004. Aarni was signed to Firebox Records's subsidiary label Firedoom Music, but is now signed to Epidemie Records. Aarni released their second album, called \"Tohcoth\", in February 2008. In late 2008 Aarni also released a CDR EP titled \"Omnimantia\". In April 2012 Aarni released a split album with Persistence in Mourning.\n\nOn Aarni's official website, the band section contains four members (also referred to as \"Responsible Cultists\"), as well as information concerning each of them. The four members of the band are Master Warjomaa, Comte de Saint-Germain, Doomintroll and Mistress Palm. Warjomaa commented on this in a 2004 interview:\n\nThe number of Aarni is five and five is the number of Aarni. Think a while about this and you will see... because Aarni consists of four personalities plus me. Why four? Because I've chosen to adhere to the (Jungian) concept of quaternity - four personality types, four seasons, four equinoxes, four elements, four stations of the sun, four stages of the human life, four cardinal directions, four Qabbalistic worlds, four limbs of the human body, four main themes in Aarni's songs, four basic human brain circuits of Timothy Leary's theory etc. Visualize the pentagram representing human existence: there's four points combined in/ruled by the fifth. It's all of course symbolic. Or is it?\n\nMaster Warjomaa is the alias of the band's most stable member. According to the band's official website, Warjomaa was born in 1974. It is stated that he is influenced by Joe Satriani, Taoism, Camel, and H. P. Lovecraft, that he belongs to the \"Homo Superior\" species, and that his favorite place is Cydonia. Along with many other artists, Warjomaa has named Black Sabbath, Candlemass, Hawkwind, King Crimson and Van der Graaf Generator as his musical influences. In a fan interview in June 2006, Warjomaa stated:\n\"While I prefer a female unicorn deity to a gaseous alpha male vertebrate of cosmic heft anytime, I'd rather choose no deity or deities at all. I think it's high time we stopped worshiping gods and started to aim at becoming gods.\"\nLe Comte de Saint Germain (translated from French: \"The Count of Saint Germain\") is one of the members of Aarni. His role in the band has been stated as \"Sensation, alchemical processes and keys to secrets\". It is written that he was born in 1665 and is an \"ex-human\". It is not stated whether le Comte de Saint Germain was an actual individual that lived centuries ago or if he is an entirely fictional character. It may be possible that le Comte de Saint Germain has something to do with the Count of St Germain, an actual count living in the 18th century.\n\nDoomintroll has been represented by a cartoon-style drawing of a person with a very prominent nose, a pipe in the mouth, the Aarni logo on the T-shirt, and a hand sticking up the middle finger. According to Aarni he \"originated\" in 1998, (also the date of the formation of Aarni) which would make him 6 years old at the time of the release of the band's first full-length album. It is written that Doomintroll belongs to the \"Duumipeikko\" species. \"Duumipeikko\", roughly translated from Finnish, gives \"Doomintroll\". This is a reference to the popular Finnish cartoon series, Moomin, in which \"Muumipeikko\" is one of the main characters. According to Doomintroll, the band wants to \"support the anarcho-shamanistic attitude of moomintrolls\".\n\nMistress Palm (also referred to as Mrs. Palm) is the fourth claimed band member. She is depicted as a rather elderly woman in an apron holding a dish brush and opening her mouth in dismay. She has been thought to be a computer program or \"artificial, phlogiston-driven rectoplasm\".\n\nAt the top of the band page is written \"4=1\". The motive of this equation is maybe to consider the situation of the 4 declared members and one actual member and/or can be a reference to the Jungian concept of quaternity. On the news page (also referred to as the \"Unspeakable Tidings\"), the news are listed chronologically. However the dates are said to be written in the form corresponding to these in the Discordian calendar. These dates follow the \"DD/SS/YYYY\" form, as stated on the official website. Therefore, e.g. the year 2007 CE is noted as 3173 AM.\n\nThe lyrics have been sung in English, Finnish, Latin, and occasionally in French, Ancient Egyptian, Glossolalic, Swedish, Ouranian Barbaric and Enochian. In several songs, the lyrics refer to the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nIn \"Squaring The Circle\", the lyrics say \"zero equals two\". This may be a reference to the ideas of Aleister Crowley and similar to the \"4=1\" statement on top of the band page of the official website. In \"The Thunder, Perfect Mindfuck\", it is said \"I am the shameless and I am ashamed\" as well as \"I am falsehood and I am truth\". These could be considered paradoxical and controversial as the Gnostic poem the lyrics seem to be based upon, The Thunder, Perfect Mind.\n\n\n\"Demo 2001\" was released independently by Aarni in 2001. It was the first CD release of Aarni.

It is the first regional natural gas transmission system in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe project began in 1982, when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) proposed the development of a natural gas pipeline throughout West Africa. In 1991 a feasibility report conducted by the World Bank on supplying Nigerian gas on West African markets deemed that a project was commercially viable.\n\nIn September 1995, the governments of four African countries signed a Heads of State Agreement. The feasibility study was carried out in 1999. On 11 August 1999, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by participating countries in Cotonou, Benin. In February 2000, an Inter-Governmental Agreement was signed. The WAGP implementation agreement was signed in 2003. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the project were held at Sekondi-Takoradi, Ghana, on 3 December 2004. Construction began in 2005.\n\nThe offshore pipeline was completed in December 2006 and was scheduled to start operating on 23 December 2007 but was delayed after leaks were detected in supply pipelines in Nigeria. The second delivery deadline was scheduled on 13 February 2008, but regular deliveries were delayed again, when one of the contractors of Willbros was shot and killed in Nigeria by armed robbers.\n\nGas deliveries were expected by the end of 2009 after commissioning regulating and metering stations in Takoradi and Tema, Ghana, Lagos Beach, Nigeria, Cotonou, Benin, and Lomé, Togo in May 2008. However, deliveries were postponed again due to an irregular amount of moisture found inside the onshore gas pipeline.\n\nThe pipeline consists three sections with a total length of . The long offshore section starts at starts the Itoki terminal in southeastern Nigeria and runs through the waters of Benin, Togo and Ghana parallel to the coastline, approximately to offshore in water depths of between and . The Nigerian onshore section of the pipeline connects the offshore section compressor station at Lagos Beach with the Chevron-owned Escravos–Lagos Pipeline System, operational since 1989. It is possible that later the WAGP will be extended to Côte d'Ivoire and in longer term even to Senegal.\n\nThe diameter of the onshore section is . The diameter of the offshore pipeline is and the capacity is 5 billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas per year. The pipeline was constructed by Willbros, with Bredero Shaw Ltd applying a concrete coating to the pipeline at its facility in Tema, Ghana. The pre-commissioning services were provided by BJ Process and Pipeline Services. The total pipeline costs around US$974 million, for which the World Bank provided a guarantee of $50 million for Ghana, while the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency provided a $75 million political risk guarantee for WAGPo as a whole.\n\nThe pipeline is owned by West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited (WAGPCo), a consortium of Chevron (36.7%), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (25%), Royal Dutch Shell (18%), Volta River Authority of Ghana (16.3%), Société Togolaise de Gaz (SoToGaz - 2%) and Société Beninoise de Gaz S.A. (SoBeGaz - 2%). The managing director of the company is Walter Perez. It is operated by Chevron Corporation.\n\nIn Ghana, provided gas was intended for the Takoradi Power Station at Aboadze near Takoradi, operated by Volta River Authority and the Takoradi International Company's (TICO). As of 2014, however, most of the gas was being consumed in Lagos.\n\nEnvironmental group Friends of the Earth has criticized the project, after local communities in Nigeria complained it would damage land, destroy livelihoods and pollute fishing areas.\n\nOn August 27, 2012, the West African Gas Pipeline was damaged when pirates who had tried to board an oil tanker in an attempt to get away from the pursuing Togolese Navy, severely damaged the pipeline with their anchor. For nearly a year, the supply of gas to Ghana, Togo and Benin ceased, causing major power supply problems to the affected countries.\n\n", "id": "7744438", "categories": ["Benin–Togo relations", "Natural gas pipelines in Nigeria", "Ghana–Nigeria relations", "Natural gas pipelines in Benin", "Natural gas pipelines in Ghana", "Natural gas pipelines in Togo", "Benin–Nigeria relations", "Energy infrastructure completed in 2006"], "title": "West African Gas Pipeline"}

The label was introduced to the public in March 1948. The label was owned by the Synthetic Plastics Company of Newark, New Jersey until the 1970s.\n\nThe label became one of the largest and most successful children's specialty record labels in America, manufacturing releases that often contrasted with those of their competitors (Wonderland Records, Kid Stuff Records, and Mr. Pickwick). Peter Pan enjoyed their greatest success as a children's label during the 1950s. Many of their most famous releases were issued on 78-RPM 7 and 10-inch records and on 45-RPM 7-inch records. Both songs (such as a cover version of \"Frosty the Snowman\") and stories (such as a heavily abridged version of \"Peter and the Wolf\", with Victor Jory narrating) were released. Releases credited a variety of performers, including Dick Edwards with the Peter Pan Chorus and Orchestra, the Caroleer Singers, the Peter Pan Players and variations on these titles.\n\nThe label was notable for its series of book-and-record sets, combining an illustrated storybook with a vinyl record that contained music and narration by \"your Peter Pan Storyteller\" (who would prompt the listener to \"turn the page\" at the sound of a bell). Bugs Bunny, Popeye the Sailor Man, The Flintstones, Bozo the Clown, Scooby-Doo and Casper the Friendly Ghost were among the characters featured in these sets.\n\nOne of its most successful releases was \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\", an original production by Peter Pan's studio collective (known as the Peppermint Kandy Kids), that featured remakes of classic Christmas holiday songs, original songs for the album, and portrayals of Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus.\n\nAlso notable was the company's run of Irwin the Disco Duck albums, which featured popular songs of their time (1976 to 1980) and were aimed at children, with the title character acting as a DJ.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7744509", "text": "Lehigh Canal\n\nThe Lehigh Canal or the Lehigh Navigation Canal is a navigable canal, beginning at the mouth of Nesquehoning Creek on the Lehigh River in Eastern Pennsylvania. It was built in two sections over a span of twenty years, beginning in 1818. The lower section spanned the distance between Easton, Pennsylvania and the town of Mauch Chunk, present-day Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. In Easton the canal met the Delaware and Morris Canals, with which goods could be brought further up the east coast. At its height, the Lehigh Canal was long.\n\nAlthough the canal was used to transport a variety of products, its most significant cargoes were anthracite coal and pig iron. Cornerstones of the American Industrial Revolution, they defined the character of the towns surrounding the canal.\n\nThe route consisted of the canals and dammed-off sections of the Lehigh River. Boatmen had to navigate their barges periodically from the canal through a lock onto the river or vice versa. This design saved time and money while the canal was being built, although it made for a slower, more difficult trip for canal-boat captains.\n\nThe Lehigh Coal Mine Company (LCMC) was founded in 1792, a few months after anthracite was discovered at Sharpe Mountain (a peak of the Pisgah Ridge near present-day Summit Hill, Pennsylvania); Its principals secured rights to over before the Lehigh Canal was built. The company found it fairly easy to find and mine coal from a pit on the mountainside, the coal had to be loaded into sacks and then onto pack animals which carried the coal at least to the Lehigh shore. Disposable skiffs known as arks were built from local timber, which were manned along the lower Lehigh River rapids. Despite many politically connected stockholders and officers, the operation was unsupervised by upper management.\nWith no officer willing to manage from the field, the LCMC hired contractors or sent out teams; this was only sporadically successful in getting coal to Philadelphia. Firewood and charcoal were expensive and hard to find in the eastern U.S. by the War of 1812. Before the war, the LCMC's record of getting coal to market was so dismal that coal imported from England was cheaper and more readily available. The war gave the company an incentive to send another expedition by independent contractors in 1813. After a year they had built five boats, but brought only two to market; this resulted in another loss for the company. The loss was the last straw for many of the company's backers, who were unwilling to fund more expeditions despite the two boats bought back by White and Hazard.\n\nThe Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, its founder Josiah White and White's protege and partner Erskine Hazard (operations managers into the mid-1860s) established a reputation for innovation. White and Hazard researched (or invented) emerging technologies as needed, pioneering industrial innovations including the first wire suspension bridge over the Schuylkill River.\nThe lower canal began as a collection of removed stone obstructions and low rock dams with a system of wooden \"bear-trap locks\" invented by Lehigh Navigation Company managing partner Josiah White, who debugged scale models of the lock design on Mauch Chunk Creek. Experiments with the bear-trap locks gave Bear Lane, an alley in Mauch Chunk off Broadway in today's Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, its name. White and partner Erskine Hazard, who operated a wire mill, foundry and nail factory at the Falls of the Schuylkill, needed energy. After learning the value of anthracite during the British blockades in 1814, White and Hazard joined a number of Philadelphians in a joint-stock venture to build the Schuylkill Canal but quarreled with those on the board of managers who did not favor rapid development. They learned that the managers of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company were willing to option their rights because of their long-term inability to make a profit by transporting anthracite nearly from Pisgah Ridge. The Lehigh Navigation Company held a charter to improve the navigability of the Lehigh River, but had accomplished little and the charter would expire in 1817. White and Hazard made a proposal specifying improvements for downriver navigation only, and received a charter giving the company ownership of the river in March 1818. The charter had a fall-back provision allowing the legislature to require improvements enabling two-way navigation.\n\nSometimes called \"The Stone Coal Turnpike\", the lower canal () was built by the Lehigh Navigation Company as a \"toll road\" to supply coal to Eastern seaboard cities between 1818 and 1820 (downriver traffic only). It was rebuilt (with locks supporting two-way traffic) between 1827 and 1829 by the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, and remained in operation until 1931. The lower canal connected the eastern part of the southern Coal Region to the Delaware River basin (primarily the Panther Creek Valley, Nesquehoning Creek Valley and mines in Beaver Meadows and along Black Creek), connecting via Penn Haven Junction to the canal head at Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania). \nThe lower canal began below Packers Dam. A wing wall projected into the upper pool to create slack water next to the loading docks, at the same level as the top of the first guard dam. That dam (known as Dam 1) was downstream of Broadway, opposite Flagstaff Hill and the cross-canal Bear Mountain for which Mauch Chunk was named. The 44 lift locks begin with Lock 1 at the dam. This was a weighing lock, using a platform which lifted a barge and weighed the boat and its load. Each non-LC&NC barge on the canal was recorded. Empty weights were subtracted, and tolls were assessed by the ton per mile traveled. Most of the 44 locks on the descent to Easton, PA were spillway variants of White's bear-trap lock. When tipped or triggered, they released several acre-feet (creating a wave to raise the water level as the canal boat sank downriver). The canal carried central Lehigh Valley anthracite to northeastern urban markets, particularly Philadelphia, Trenton and Wilmington, and supporting new industry in Bristol, Allentown and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania with the Morris and Delaware and Raritan Canals and a number of railroads. The privately funded canal became part of the Pennsylvania Canal system, a complex of canals, towpaths and (eventually) railroads. It was last used for cargo in 1942, and the LC&N Company was sold to Pennsylvania for preservation and recreational use in 1964. Portions of the canal and the later rail lines flanking it are part of the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor, a multi-use rail trail.\n\nThe lower canal improvements were initially designed and engineered by LC&N founder Josiah White after the company become disenchanted with the Schuylkill Canal's board of directors. By the winter of 1814, the company was interested in transporting Lehigh Valley coal to Philadelphia.\n\nBy late 1822, skepticism about anthracite was waning. The cost of building an ark for every load of coal delivered to the Philadelphia docks in 1822 (as LC&N operations were hitting their stride) worried the company's board of directors. By mid-1822, managing director Josiah White was consulting with veteran Erie-Canal lock engineer Canvass White. By late in the year, White had shifted construction efforts from improving the one-way system (begun in 1818) to a test project on the four upper dams of the canal. The project involved two-way dams and locks with a wider lift channel and lengths of over , capable of taking a steam tug and a coastal cargo ship from from the Delaware to the slack-water pool at Mauch Chunk. In 1823, White and Hazard proposed a plan to the Pennsylvania legislature.\n\nIn 1823, after building and testing four locks, Josiah White made a proposal to the Pennsylvania legislature to continue the improvements down the Lehigh River. His plan included locks suitable for a coastal schooner and towing steam tug, the types of boats which dominated ports along the of the Delaware River controlled by the LC&N. The following year, the legislature rejected his proposal; lumber and timber interests feared that damming would prevent them from rafting logs on the rivers to local sawmills. White and Hazard scrambled to increase mine production while producing enough lumber for arks to send their coal along the Delaware to Philadelphia. In 1827, a revision to the Main Line of Public Works funded the promised Delaware Canal. The LC&N began converting the canal to support two-way operation, work which continued into 1829. In 1831, the LC&N stopped making one-way arks and began building large, durable barges, expecting their return via a connection with the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal in Easton.\n\nThe expanded Lehigh Canal extended , between Mauch Chunk and Easton. Its 52 locks, eight guard locks, eight dams and six aqueducts allowed the waterway to rise over in elevation. A weigh lock south of Mauch Chunk determined canal-boat fees. A cable-ferry connection across the Delaware River to the Morris Canal and through New Jersey created a more-direct route from the Lehigh Canal to New York City. To the south, the Delaware and Raritan Canal had a complementary canal built along the east bank of the Delaware.\n\nInspired by the successful transport of freight over the Allegheny Front escarpment via the Allegheny Portage Railroad system, during the mid-1830s the business community and the legislature sought a extension. The Upper Lehigh Canal, designed by Canvass White, was built from 1837 to 1843 as authorized by the 1837 revision of the Main Line of Public Works.\n\nThe upper Lehigh was a turbulent river with steep sides; a large portion was in a ravine, the Lehigh Gorge. The upper canal rose over in elevation to the Mauch Chunk slack-water pool. Unlike the lower canal (where most locks lifted less than in easy stages, the upper-canal design relied on deep-lift locks. The maximum lift on the lower canal was less than , but the upper-canal locks lifted a maximum of ; this is comparable to the lift of the lower canal in a bit over half the distance, using less than as many locks per mile. The upper canal design's 20 dams, 29 locks and a number of reservoirs provided working flow even in dry summers. \nThe project included four major construction hurdles and three new railroad projects, for which LC&N created a new subsidiary: the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (LH&S). From north to south, the rail projects were:\n\nThe canal's collapse began when a wet spring in 1862 repeatedly overfilled embankment dam reservoirs until the dam above White Haven failed, triggering a cascade of failing dams in a flood on June 4. Between 100 or 200 lives were lost in the villages and canal works below, the number varying by source. The Pennsylvania legislature forbade the rebuilding of the upper canal. The canal was used for transportation until the 1940s (about a decade after similar canals ceased operations), and it was North America's last fully functioning towpath canal. In 1962, most of it was sold to private and public organizations for recreational use.\n\nSeveral segments of the canal were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, including \"Lehigh Canal\", \"Carbon County Section of the Lehigh Canal\" (#79002179), \"Lehigh Canal: Eastern Section Glendon and Abbott Street Industrial Sites\" (#78002437) and \"Lehigh Canal; Allentown to Hopeville Section\" (#79002307). For the Carbon County section, also known as \"Upper Canal Lock #1 to Lower Canal Dam #3\", the listing included 30 contributing structures.\n\nThe eastern section (now preserved as a recreational-boating area) runs along the Lehigh River from Hopeville to the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers in Easton and includes the Chain Bridge, which was NRHP-listed in 1974. The eastern-section listing is for a area with three contributing buildings, seven contributing sites and 11 contributing structures. The Allentown-to-Hopeville section is a area which includes Greek Revival and Federal architecture in its contributing building and 13 contributing structures.\n\nAn 8-mile (13-km) segment of the canal towpath has been converted into a multi-use trail from Freemansburg through Bethlehem to Allentown.

The poster accused them of \"crimes against humanity\" and offered a $5,000 reward for the \"arrest, conviction and revocation of license to practice medicine\" of these physicians. The poster was published in Life Advocate magazine. A second poster targeted a specific person, Dr. Robert Crist, offered a reward for persuading him \"to turn from his child killing,\" and included his name, address, and photo.\n\nIn 1996 it revealed its \"Nuremberg Files\" which included dossiers on abortion providers, politicians, judges, clinic employees and other abortion rights supporters. The ACLA claimed that these dossiers could be used for trials for \"crimes against humanity\" when the nation's laws changed to prohibit abortion. Neal Horsley, an activist, published the information on his website. His website greyed the names of those injured and crossed out the names of those killed by anti-abortion activists.\n\nPlanned Parenthood successfully sued the ACLA. Although the posters and website did not contain any specific threat, the jury awarded $107 million. The ACLA appealed the verdict on First Amendment grounds. A panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals initially overturned the verdict, holding that the activities of the ACLA were protected under the First Amendment because they did not directly threaten harm to the plaintiffs, and because the ACLA's statements were not communicated privately to the plaintiffs. The en banc 9th Circuit reversed the panel<http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/abortion/ppacla51602opn.pdf>, and held that the ACLA could be held liable in damages because the website made a deliberate threat with the expectation that someone would act on it, unprotected by the First Amendment.\n\nThe information in this article is taken from the statement of facts as set forth in \nPlanned Parenthood of Columbia/Willamette, Inc. v.

However, after the construction of the Trans-Australian Railway in 1917, another railway station named after Barton in the South Australian stretch of the Nullarbor Plain led to another name change – this time to Piesse, after two prominent residents Frederick Henry Piesse and Charles Austin Piesse, in December 1918.

McLean moved to Nashville to pursue a career in songwriting. A month after arriving in Music City, she signed her first staff songwriting deal with an upstart publishing company, Little Big Town, run by publishing mogul, Woody Bomar.\n\nOne year later, she received her first songwriting credit for Terri Gibbs, who had recently received the CMA's Horizon Award. From that sprang a continuing career of over 200 songwriting credits including genres of country, bluegrass, Americana, AAA, pop, and blues. In 1999, McLean received a Dove Award for Country Gospel song of the year for \"Count Your Blessing\" which was recorded by The Martins. Other artists who've recorded Kim McLean songs include Tim McGraw, The Happy Goodmans, Trisha Yearwood, Jennifer Hanson, Lee Ann Womack, Billy Gilman, Sierra, and more. Since her first publishing deal with Little Big Town, she has also written for EMI, Centergy, King Lizard, New Haven, Worley World, Skyline, and Sony-Tree. Her own publishing company, Kim McLean Music houses most of her Gospel copyrights.\n\nHer songs have been used on several major network TV shows including \"JAG\", \"Early Edition\", \"As the World Turns\", \"The West Wing\", and \"Hope & Faith\", which also included a cameo appearance by McLean. Rick Schroder used \"All We Ever Find\", a McLean composition recorded by Tim McGraw, for the feature film \"Black Cloud\", about a Native American boxer who made the Olympic boxing team.\n\nIn 2001, McLean returned to her maiden name, and launched a solo artist career of her own with the creation of Hippie Chick Twang Records. Her album, \"Happy Face\" contains the song \"Angels and Eagles\" with Dolly Parton starring as background singer. The title cut of the album, Kim McLean composed with Kenny Alphin, Big Kenny of Big and Rich.\n\nAt the same time she began her artist career, she used her songwriting royalties to reclaim a lost dream of a college education, cut short in her teen-age years due to an almost fatal struggle with an eating disorder. Treatment, recovery, and years of hoping led her to Trevecca Nazarene University (TNU) in Nashville, just a stone's throw from Music Row. In 2005, McLean graduated with honors and a degree in music business from TNU, and re-enrolled in the fall for the Master's Program in Bible. At this time, McLean is teaching songwriting at TNU as Adjunct Professor of Songwriting.\n\nHippie Chick Twang, the company she founded, has grown from a small indie label co-op that touts \"positive music for women and the men who love them\" to a media company and music publishing house. McLean partnered with one of her co-writers, broadcaster Devon O'Day to form the Hippie Chick Twang enterprises. In 2006, Kim McLean won the Just Plain Folk Awards' Americana Song of the Year with \"Forever Everyday\". Her album, \"Happy Face\" was voted third runner up in the Americana Album of the Year.\n\n\"Goodbye My Friend: Celebrating the Memory of a Pet\" is a book/CD combination with text written by Devon O'Day and an accompanying CD written and performed by McLean. It is a gift of condolence and comfort for someone who's lost a pet.

KENZ moved down the dial to provide a better signal to the area. Since the station was broadcasting from Lake Mountain, it had difficulties covering the northern end of the Wasatch Front.

He was an early adopter of the National Romantic Style, but turned later to the neo-classical style of the 1920s. \n\nCarl Westman was born in Uppsala in 1866. He studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in 1885-1889, and then at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1889-1892, in Stockholm. In 1893 he married artist Elin Andersson and moved to the United States where he practiced with architect R. L. Daus in New York City in 1893-1895. \n\nIn 1895, he returned to Stockholm to work for architect Aron Johansson (who at that time was the architect working with the new Parliament building (1895-1904) in Stockholm). In 1897, Westman opened his own architect bureau. He became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1912 and in 1916 he became the chief architect of the Swedish Royal Medical Board. \n\nCarl Westman was one of the foremost advocators in Sweden for a return to the national characteristics in architecture. He was one of the first Swedish architects who developed the new Nordic National Romantic Style, a style which took the cultural and building precedents and merged them with ideas from the English Arts and Crafts movement to create a very distinct Swedish architecture often in brick and wood. \n\nCarl Westman's Swedish General Medical Association building in Stockholm (1904-1906) was the first building built in the National Romantic Style, with the Röhss Museum in Gothenburg (1910-1914) and Stockholm Court House (1911-1915), providing another two prominent examples. The Stockholm Courthouse has striking similarities with the medieval Vadstena Castle, and provides a dazzling sight in downtown Stockholm, though the building proves quite inflexible for its purposes. \n\nLater on, Westman worked particularly as a hospital architect, gradually adopting the classical style of the 1920s, with noted examples being the Beckomberga Hospital (1927-1935), and the Karolinska Hospital (1935-1940) which was completed after his death. Whereas the psychiatric hospital at Beckomberga was strictly symmetrically planned, with massive buildings grouped in a fairly functional pattern, the Karolinska hospital strives towards a more functional architecture where the symmetrical design was toned down.\n\nCarl Westman was also a part-time interior designer of furniture and utility supplies such as tiled stoves. He died in Stockholm in 1936.\n\n", "id": "7744688", "categories": ["1866 births", "1936 deaths", "Swedish architects", "Swedish interior designers", "Royal Institute of Technology alumni"], "title": "Carl Westman"}

He also acted in plays, produced theatre and taught. From 1939 to 1946 he was principal comedian of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company playing the comic leads in Gilbert and Sullivan's Savoy operas.\n\nAfter the war Clifford was a founding member of the Covent Garden Opera Company with which he played character roles in the German, French and Italian repertoire. In the last decades of his life he lived in New Zealand, where he performed, taught and directed until his retirement in 1981.\n\nClifford was born Clifford White in Burnley, Lancashire. He attended the Royal Manchester College of Music from 1925 to 1928, winning the Stocks Massey Scholarship and appeared in \"The Marriage of Figaro\" at the college in 1928. From 1928 to 1930, he studied at the Royal College of Music in London under a scholarship endowed by Ernest Palmer. Still appearing under his original name, he created the role of Frank Ford in Vaughan Williams's opera \"Sir John in Love\" in a college production in which his fellow-student Richard Watson played Falstaff. By the following year Clifford had adopted his stage name, under which he again appeared as Master Ford in an Oxford Festival production of \"Sir John in Love\", conducted, as the premiere had been, by Malcolm Sargent.\n\nClifford's first professional London performance was in Handel's opera \"Giulio Cesare\" in 1930, in a production arranged and conducted by Gervase Hughes. In 1933 he played Constable in Vaughan Williams's \"Hugh the Drover\", conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. During the early 1930s he toured with the Carl Rosa Opera Company, with whom his roles included Tonio in \"Pagliacci\", Alberich in \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", Dr. Miracle in \"The Tales of Hoffmann\" and the title part in \"Rigoletto\", in which the anonymous critic in \"The Observer\" judged that he sang well but slightly over-acted.\n\nFor several years in the 1930s Clifford left singing to teach and act in plays and to produce plays and operas at the Westminster Theatre. In 1937, he returned to opera, joining the Covent Garden company for the annual seasons at the Royal Opera House as principal baritone. He made his television debut in 1938 as King Claudius in W. S. Gilbert's play \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\".\n\nIn September 1939, at the outbreak of the Second World War, the British government ordered all theatres to close indefinitely. Rupert D'Oyly Carte cancelled the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's entire autumn tour and terminated the contracts of all of his performers. When the company started up again at Christmas 1939, Carte's principal comedian, Martyn Green, had accepted another engagement and was not available. At Richard Watson's suggestion Clifford auditioned for the vacancy and was engaged to play Green's roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, which were produced in repertory by the company. He was coached by the company's director, J. M. Gordon, who had worked with W.S. Gilbert, but Carte encouraged Clifford to recreate all his characters afresh. \"The Times\" said of his performance in \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", \"the final moments in which the heartbroken merryman struggles to hide his grief are played with real beauty. Mr Clifford makes no attempt to imitate his predecessors in the part, and his performance gains immensely as a result.\" The \"Times\" critic, who had seen the original cast of \"The Mikado\", considered Clifford \"second to none\" as Ko-Ko.\n\nFrom 1939 to 1946, Clifford performed with the D'Oyly Carte company nearly year-round. His eight roles were: Sir Joseph Porter in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", Major-General Stanley in \"The Pirates of Penzance\", Bunthorne in \"Patience\", the Lord Chancellor in \"Iolanthe\", Ko-Ko in \"The Mikado\", Robin Oakapple in \"Ruddigore\", Jack Point in \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", and the Duke of Plaza-Toro in \"The Gondoliers\".\n\nAfter leaving D'Oyly Carte in August 1946, Clifford appeared in a new production of the comic opera \"Merrie England\", before becoming a founder-member of the new Royal Opera company at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. In the inaugural production, \"Carmen\", in January 1947, he played Dancairo. In the Italian repertory he played Benoit in \"La bohème\" and Ping in \"Turandot\". In German operas he ranged from Faninal in \"Der Rosenkavalier\" and Beckmesser in \"Die Meistersinger\" to Alberich in \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", alongside guest singers including Kirsten Flagstad, Hans Hotter and Set Svanholm. At the first Covent Garden performances of \"Peter Grimes\" he played Ned Keene. In 1950 Clifford recorded the roles of Spalanzani and Frantz in a recording of \"The Tales of Hoffman\" conducted by Beecham, which later formed the soundtrack of the 1951 film version. In 1952 he appeared in a BBC television production of \"Pagliacci\", in the role of Tonio. in 1953, the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, he appeared as Walter Winkins in \"Merrie England\" in an outdoor production at Luton Hoo house, with nearly 1,000 performers.\n\nFrom 1953–54 Clifford returned to the Royal Manchester College of Music to teach and to help create a school of opera. For the next two years, he taught privately and performed and directed in London. In 1956 he joined the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company, succeeding Ivan Menzies as principal comedian, to tour in Australia and New Zealand. His co-stars included his old friend Richard Watson, Muriel Brunskill, Helen Roberts and Richard Walker. He moved in 1958 to Dunedin, New Zealand, where he directed a number of theatre and opera companies until 1964, including the Dunedin Repertory Company, Dunedin Opera Company, Shakespeare Company, and Oamaru Operatic Company. He also taught privately from 1963–65.\n\nIn the 1960s Clifford toured with the New Zealand Opera Company in roles such as Frosch in \"Die Fledermaus\", which he had first played at Covent Garden in the 1930s. He also continued to teach and direct. In 1976, he performed the role of King Gama in \"Princess Ida\" for the Dunedin Gilbert and Sullivan Company's 25th anniversary production. He made a TV film of \"Gianni Schicchi\", in the role of Doctor Spinelloccio, in 1979, and retired in 1981.\n\nClifford died in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1984 at the age of 79.\n\nClifford appears in Sir Thomas Beecham's studio recording of \"The Tales of Hoffman\" (1951) and his live Covent Garden \"The Bartered Bride\" (1939).\n\nClifford also appeared in a 1938 television production of W. S. Gilbert's \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" as King Claudius. In 1952 he appeared in a BBC television production of \"Pagliacci\", in the role of Tonio.\n\n", "id": "7744705", "categories": ["Gilbert and Sullivan performers", "1984 deaths", "People from Burnley", "20th-century English male actors", "1905 births", "20th-century English singers", "English opera singers"], "title": "Grahame Clifford"}

Tenenbom was called the \"founder of a new form of Jewish theatre\" by the French \"Le Monde\" and a \"New Jew\" by the Israeli \"Maariv\". \nTenenbom is also an academic, having university degrees in mathematics, computer science, dramatic writing and literature.\n\nTenenbom has written over sixteen plays for The Jewish Theater of New York. German newspaper \"Die Zeit\" described Tenenbom's play \"The Last Virgin\" as \"more desperately needed in Germany than suspected\"; \"The New York Times\", reviewing \"Father of the Angels\", called it \"irresistibly fascinating\"; and \"Corriere della Sera\", reviewing \"Last Jew In Europe\", named Tenenbom \"One of the most iconoclastic and innovative of contemporary dramatists.\"\n\nTenenbom writes for many newspapers and websites, and his political articles, cultural criticism and essays have appeared in media outlets including \"Die Zeit\" of Germany, \"Corriere della Sera\" of Italy, \"Yedioth Ahronot\" of Israel and Fox News. Tuvia Tenenbom was also a political columnist for \"Zeit Online\"; his column appeared every second week. He is a frequent contributor for \"Die Zeit\" .\n\nTenenbom's book \"I Sleep in Hitler's Room\", published by an imprint of The Jewish Theater of New York, is a psychological travelogue through present-day Germany. Described by the Israeli paper \"Haaretz\" as an \"alarming account of anti-Semitism,\" the book details the wide spread of modern anti-Semitism in Europe. \"Tuvia Tenenbom comes off as a Jewish Hunter S. Thompson,\" said David P. Goldman (under the pseudonym Spengler) of the \"Asia Times\" in his review of the book, adding, \"To understand Germans, one has to learn their language and live with them – or read Tenenbom's book.\" Bruce Bawer, reviewing it for PJ Media, writes: \"It's a book in a category all its own — deeply sobering, depressing even, in its observations of the darker side of Germany, yet at the same time so chatty and engaging and laugh-out-loud funny that it's hard to put down.\" The book also received strong endorsement from the \"National Review\", which called it \"a tremendous book.\"\n\nIn December 2012, a German translation of Tenenbom's book titled \"Allein unter Deutschen\" (\"Alone Among Germans\"), published by Suhrkamp Verlag of Berlin, became an instant bestseller on the \"Spiegel\" bestseller list. Upon publication in Germany, book critics differed widely in their opinions of the work. \"Spiegel\"'s Wolfgang Höbel and Jakob Augstein were highly critical of the book. \"Die Tageszeitung\" (\"taz\") was extremely critical, writing that Tenenbom's book offered \"zero insight\", while \"Jungle World\"  called the book \"a gem.\" The German-Jewish journalist Henryk M. Broder praised Tenenbom's \"one-sidedness,\" comparing him to both Michael Moore and to Sacha Baron Cohen's \"Borat\". German TV station WDR, which Tenenbom accused in his book of assisting an anti-Semitic group in Cologne, dismissed the book as \"embarrassing or dumb\". Deutschlandfunk advised its listeners not to buy the book and encouraged those who had already bought it to bring it back to the bookstore. Evelyn Finger of \"Die Zeit\"  praised the book, calling it \"courageous\" and describing its content as a \"Kamikaze ride of discovery into Germany's national character.\" In Germany's Jewish weekly \"Jüdische Allgemeine\", which is published by the Jewish community of Germany, Hannes Stein endorsed Tenenbom's book and findings: \"This book contains the bitter nectar of the pure, unfiltered truth.\"\n\nTenenbom's book \"Catch the Jew!\", published by Gefen Publishing recounts the adventures of Tuvia Tenenbom, who wanders around Israel of our time calling himself \"Tobi the German.\" \n\nIn the course of numerous interviews Tuvia extracts information, sentiments, hidden theories and delusional visions motivating the miscellany of peoples forming the present-day Holy Land. \"The Wall Street Journal\" hailed the book, writing: \"\"Catch the Jew!\" offers one of the more interesting portraits of Palestinian politics to have appeared in English,\" and concluding that \"no reader of \"Catch the Jew!\" can come away having failed to learn many new things about Israelis and Palestinians, two peoples we talk about so much but understand so little.\"\n\nA reviewer for \"Publishers Weekly\" writes that Tenenbom's \"riveting tale, chock full of unbelievable and hilarious encounters, is highly engaging and emotional, eminently readable, brutally honest, and likely the most uncensored and eye-opening report readers will see.\"\n\n\"Catch the Jew!\" was published in Israel in September 2014 by Sela Meir publishers and became an instant best seller in Israel, reaching the  1 spot on \"Haaretz\", Steimatzky and Yedioth Ahronot best-seller lists, winning major praise by Israeli critics. \"Mida\" called Tenenbom \"the ultimate leftist and humanist who loves all people, is everything the left pretends to be but is not,\" while Channel 2 TV named it \"the most important book in the last five years,\" and \"Haaretz\" advised its readers to \"read Tenenbom's book; we don't have the luxury not to know what he's telling us.\" In Germany, the book came out in November 2014 by the publishing house of Suhrkamp under the title \"Allein unter Juden\" (Alone Among Jews) and immediately became a Spiegel Best Seller. \n\nThe book earned major endorsements by German critics. \"Spiegel Online\" said: \"You need to have curiosity in you and a fearlessness of thought to view the Middle East story differently, a curiosity and a fearlessness that Tuvia Tenenbom has,\" and \"Die Welt\" called it, \"The finest book on the Middle East saga.\"\n\nIn October 2016 Tenenbom's third book, \"Allein unter Amerikanern\" was published by Suhrkamp Verlag in Berlin, Germany, where it became a \"Der Spiegel\" bestseller. In March 2017 it was published in English by Gefen Publishing. Tuvia Tenenbom travels through America to find out who are the Americans, the people who make up America.\nA contributor to \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote: \"Brutal, irreverent, and cutting, Tenenbom’s riveting book aims to disrupt American complacency.\" \n\nTenenbom's fourth book, \"Hello, Refugees!\" came out in English in July 2017, following its publication in German by Suhrkamp Verlag in March 2017, under the title \"Allein unter Flüchtlingen\". In \"Hello, Refugees!\" Tenenbom chronicles his visits to many refugee camps in Germany, reporting of horrific conditions in most of those camps. Additionally, \"Hello, Refugees!\" contains interviews with politicians and activists from the far-right to the far-left, whom he asked to explain to him why has Germany taken in more refugees than other European countries. \"The Jerusalem Post\" called the book \"a gem,\" and \"Asia Times\" said that \"If Kafka had written non-fiction, he could not have bested Tenenbom’s latest book.\"\n\nVideo interview with Tenenbom\n", "id": "7744760", "categories": ["Israeli emigrants to the United States", "Living people", "1957 births", "Israeli theatre directors"], "title": "Tuvia Tenenbom"}
