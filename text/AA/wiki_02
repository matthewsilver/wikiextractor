Foundation Center, an independent nonprofit organization, ranks it among the top 100 foundations in the nation by asset size and total giving. Among all community foundations, CCF is 5th by total giving and 7th by asset size, as of the fiscal year that ended 6/30/12.\n\nCCF is public, charitable organization dedicated to strengthening communities of Los Angeles County through effective philanthropy and civic engagement. It fulfills its mission through fundraising, charitable fund management, grantmaking, and convenings with donors, financial advisors, local nonprofits and foundation partners. It also serves as an advocate for the vulnerable and poor.\n\n1915 – CCF is established by Joseph Sartori and managed by Security Trust and Savings Bank in Los Angeles. For the next 65 years, the community foundation stays relatively small and is affectionately known as the “typewriter foundation” for making small grants mostly for equipment and capital.\n\n1946 – Mary Bierce becomes first full-time employee of the foundation. Joseph Sartori passes and leaves the foundation $1 million in his estate.\n\n1955 – The foundation achieves $10 million in assets and awards $300,000 in grants.\n\n1963 – The first donor advised funds are established at the foundation by Eugene and Harold Stern.\n\n1976 – David Hess is named Executive Secretary of the foundation which, at this time, still functions in very close association with the trust department of Security Pacific National Bank as a \"trust-form\" community foundation.\n\n1980 – David Hess resigns as Executive Secretary and the board of trustees hires Jack Shakely as the foundation's first Executive Director.\n\n1986 – When the AIDS epidemic begins ravaging Los Angeles, CCF and donors take the lead in addressing prevention, treatment and social services, funding vital programs that are deemed “too controversial” by government agencies.\n\n1986 – As a result of a fire that nearly destroys the historic Los Angeles Public Library, CCF launches the Save the Books campaign and 10,000 donors respond.\n\n1988 – With an initial gift from the J. Paul Getty Trust, CCF establishes an annual fellowship program for emerging and mid-career visual artists who live and work in L.A.\n\n1997 – Peter Drucker, the father of modern management and a mentor of CCF executive vice president Joe Lumarda, names CCF one of the 10 best-managed nonprofits in the U.S.\n\n1999 – The sale of Centinela Hospital Medical Center results in the creation of the Centinela Medical Community Fund and Centinela Medical Care Fund at CCF to ensure that residents of Inglewood, Hawthorne, Lennox, Los Angeles, El Segundo, Watts, Compton and Lawndale continue to have access to affordable health care services.\n\n2000 – With gifts from two anonymous donors, CCF establishes a fund to provide fast, one-time assistance to individuals in dire financial situations, asking only that beneficiaries “pass it along” with two acts of kindness to others.\n\n2002 – CCF establishes the Community Foundation Land Trust in order to create development opportunities for affordable homes, achieve equity appreciation for entry-level homeowners and ensure homes remain permanently affordable for generations. Over the next seven years, CCF will invest more than $20 million in properties within Los Angeles County.\n\n2004 – Jack Shakely retires as president after 24 years spent growing the assets of the foundation, distinguishing CCF in national philanthropic circles, and laying the groundwork for future expansion of the foundation's assets and influence in the region. Antonia Hernández, a former member of the board of directors, becomes the California Community Foundation's President and CEO.\n\n2006 – In October, the foundation announces a $200 million bequest from the late philanthropist Joan Palevsky. Her unrestricted gift is CCF’s largest to date, boosting its assets to more than $1 billion and doubling its community grantmaking to about $20 million annually.\n\n2006 – CCF launches the El Monte Community Building Initiative (CBI), a landmark 10-year initiative to engage residents of the City of El Monte in developing solutions that will ensure children and youth grow up healthier and better prepared for college and careers.\n\n2006 – CCF opens the Iraq Afghanistan Deployment Impact Fund (IADIF) with one donor for the purpose of funding nonprofit organizations that support U.S. military personnel and families who are being impacted by deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n2007 – CCF launches the Los Angeles Preschool Advocacy Initiative (LAPAI) to educate parents on the importance of early learning and involvement in their children's education, engage local and regional policymakers, and award grants to nonprofit organizations.\n\n2008 – The foundation achieves $1 billion in assets, managing 1,500 unique charitable funds.\n\n2009 – CCF makes emergency grants to support the fight of massive wildfires in the Angeles National Forest, as it did in response to similar California fires in 2003 and in 2007.\n\n2010 – CCF receives the Council on Foundations' 2010 Critical Impact Award for community foundations for the Iraq Afghanistan Deployment Impact Fund.

County residents in the population census through a combination of cross-sector partnerships, strategic grantmaking, and innovative technology and data.\n\n2011 – CCF and The Eisner Foundation honor six outstanding nonprofits and three extraordinary individuals with the Unsung Heroes of Los Angeles Awards.\n\n2011 – An anonymous bequest allows CCF to launch \"Preparing Achievers for Tomorrow\" (PAT), a $12 million investment in community-based nonprofits providing music, sports and recreation programs to 14- to 18-year-olds in South L.A.\n\n2012 – CCF launches a five-year, $5 million initiative, called Building a Lifetime of Opportunities and Options for Men (BLOOM), concentrated in South L.A.\n\nCCF provides grants and other support to a range of local nonprofits with an emphasis on helping vulnerable populations and strengthening communities of L.A. County in five areas.\n\nArts Program aim to strengthen the cultural vitality of L.A. County by increasing the operational capacity of small and mid-size arts and cultural organizations, increasing arts opportunities that are affordable and accessible to underserved communities, and improving participation in the arts by diverse, low-income residents and professional artists.\n\nEducation Program focuses on improving school readiness and K-5 student performances in reading and math and support partnerships among schools, districts, teachers and parents that demonstrate a commitment to this goal.\n\nHealth Care Program seeks to improve access to regular, sustainable and affordable sources of quality health care for low-income adults and children, with a focus on community clinics and uninsured individuals.\n\nHousing and Neighborhoods Program concentrates on increasing access to affordable housing, and efforts that emphasize multiservice, geographically focused approaches to improve conditions in underserved neighborhoods. In conjunction with the program, the Community Foundation Land Trust of CCF buys land, works with private and public partners that obtain financing and approvals to build, and then ensures that they remain affordable homes for decades to come.\n\nFoundation grants are also made on a limited basis to nonprofits for adults with developmental disabilities, aging adults, animal welfare, disaster relief, and transitional-age foster youth. Donor advised grants comprise the majority of annual grantmaking by CCF and may be directed to worthwhile causes and qualified organizations anywhere in the world.\n\nCCF believes the actions of ordinary people can affect the outcomes of larger issues in their lives through collective engagement and shared problem-solving, and therefore is an advocate, leader and investor in civic engagement activities that foster social change. These activities include:\n\nImmigrant Integration A concentrated effort through local nonprofits with cultural competence to integrate newcomers into the social, civic and economic fabric of life in L.A. County.\n\nLos Angeles Citizenship Collaboration An initiative to encourage and assist eligible Legal Permanent residents to become U.S. citizens, in partnership with members of the nonprofit, public and private sectors and local funders.\n\nLos Angeles Preschool Advocacy Initiative A multi-year effort since 2007 with the David and Lucille Packard Foundation to increase access to quality early care and education for underserved communities and to support efforts that address the child care and development needs of children, ages 0–5.\n\n", "id": "7706926", "categories": ["Community foundations based in the United States", "Non-profit organizations based in Los Angeles"], "title": "California Community Foundation"}

(March 7, 1910 – February 8, 2006) was a Canadian jazz musician and bandleader whose big band Mart Kenney and His Western Gentlemen was Canada's premier dance band during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nKenney was born in Toronto, the son of Mildred Agnes (Martin) and Herbert Kenney. Kenney established himself as a leading alto and baritone saxophonist and clarinetist in the 1920s as a member of the CJOR Radio Orchestra and as a sideman to Len Chamberlain at the Hotel Vancouver. The Western Gentlemen were first formed in 1931 as a result of an engagement at Vancouver's Alexandra Ballroom, for which he recruited trumpeter-pianist Glen Griffith, trumpeter Jack Hemmings, saxophonist Bert Lister and bassist Hec MacCallum, who would later be joined by drummer Ed Emel and vocalist-saxophonist-pianist Art Hallman. Following their CJOR radio debut in 1934, the band embarked on a three-year run at the Waterton Glacier International Peace Park in Waterton Park, Alberta, adopting as its theme song the 1922 Billy Hill-Larry Yoell waltz, \"The West, a Nest and You, Dear\".\n\nKenney and his band gained a foothold in network radio in 1935 with the CRBC/CBC program 'Sweet and Low' which in turn led to cross-country tours and regular appearances at Toronto's Royal York Hotel. In 1938 the band began recording with RCA and by 1951 it had recorded some 25 78s for RCA Victor and Bluebird Records, as well as two for Dominion, featuring such hits as \"The West, a Nest and You, Dear\", \"There's Honey on the Moon Tonight,' and the Kenney original 'We're Proud of Canada'.\n\nWhile originally a septet, Kenney toyed his band's lineup frequently, enlarging it to as many as 30 musicians on some of his recordings. See \"Appendix A~ Mart Kenney's Musicians\" in \"Mart Kenney and his Western Gentlemen\" for additional details. Western Gentlemen's guitarist (Summer 1937-1942) Tony Bradan married former Western Gentlemen's vocalist (1940-late 1943) Judy Richards.\n\nKenney's semi-retirement and relocation to Mission, British Columbia, saw the end of the Western Gentlemen. However, he continued to organize orchestras for special occasions such as CBC TV's \"In the Mood\" in 1971, and a Canadian National Exhibition appearance in 1975, and for engagements throughout the 1980s in the Vancouver area.\n\nIn Mission, Kenney took up the real estate business and ran successfully for municipal councillor, while also volunteering extensively with the National Parole Board, Corrections Canada, the Mission Chamber of Commerce and the BC Lions Society for Crippled Children and served on an advisory council for Mission medium security institution For his efforts on behalf of the community he was honoured with the status of Freeman of the municipality in 1979 and Citizen of the Year in 1981. In 1992 he was honoured with the title of Senior Citizen of the Year in British Columbia and in 1996 was made Mission's Ambassador-at-large. During his tenure on council, he helped establish a reserve fund with profits from the municipality's tree farm to support arts and culture in the community.\nKenney was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1980, and in 1985 was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Lethbridge. In 1995, he reprised his wartime concert performances when he conducted a dance band at the Bay Street Armoury in Victoria, BC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The following year, he released a new album, \"Mart Kenney: the 78 rpm Years\", containing twenty-two of the songs previously recorded with his band in times past.\n\nKenney attempted to enter politics in 1968 but lost the Liberal nomination in York North to Barney Danson who went on to serve as a cabinet minister under Pierre Trudeau.\n\nKenney had three children. His first wife was Rosetta Matilda Smillie. In addition to instrumentalists, Kenney also featured numerous singers over the years, most notably Norma Locke, whom Kenney married in 1952 and who performed with Kenney from 1944 until his retirement in 1969. Norma, who died of cancer in 1990, was also instrumental in community affairs, having helped create the Mission Heritage Association, and being the driving force for the creation of the Fraser River Heritage Park.\n\nJason Kenney, Calgary Southeast Member of Parliament from 1997 to 2016, is Mart Kenney's grandson.\n\nOften referred to as \"one of Canada's national treasures\", Kenney died on February 8, 2006, aged 95, following a lengthy battle with Alzheimer's and vascular dementia in Mission, BC.\n\nThe District of Mission commemorated the contributions of the Kenneys by naming Kenney Avenue, which runs off Oyama Avenue near the Mission Sports Park, which is near their former home.\n\n", "id": "7706929", "categories": ["20th-century Canadian musicians", "20th-century saxophonists", "Canadian jazz saxophonists", "Musicians from Vancouver", "Deaths from Alzheimer's disease", "Musicians from Toronto", "Members of the Order of Canada", "Canadian jazz bandleaders", "1910 births", "People from Mission, British Columbia", "2006 deaths", "20th-century male musicians", "Male saxophonists"], "title": "Mart Kenney"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706961", "text": "Richards controller\n\nThe Richards controller is a method of implementing a finite state machine using simple integrated circuits and combinational logic. The method was named after its inventor, Charles L. Richards. One of the distinct advantages of this method over conventional finite state machine design methods is that it allows for easier design of complex finite state machines than the traditional techniques of state diagrams, state transition tables and Boolean algebra offer. Using Richards's technique, it becomes easier to implement finite state machines with hundreds or even thousands of states.\n\nThe Richards controller was developed because of the need for an easier method of designing finite state machines than using the traditional method of state diagrams, state transition tables, and logic minimization. At the time, many of the computer based logic minimization tools that we have today did not exist. Hence, logic minimization was for the most part limited to the use of Karnaugh maps and DeMorgan's law. Because of this, Charles L. Richards invented a method of implementing a finite state machine that did not need an explicit state transition table. He published his findings in the February 1973 issue of \"Electronics\". His generalized implementation became popular and by the 1980s was considered a classic design method. While it is unlikely that commercial products found today contain a classic Richards controller (since there are faster designs now than ones that use loadable counters), there is a good chance of a modified Richards controller or a design derived from the Richards controller being used.\n\nBecause of the Richards controller's ability to scale to use many states easily, it can be used in many practical applications.\n\nThe Richards controller is a Mealy machine since its output is dependent on both the current state and the input. However Richards designed his own method of representing states using a flowchart diagram, instead of the state diagram. Each state is represented as a transfer condition on the flowchart. Each condition has two control paths leading out of it, a YES or a NO. The condition is YES or NO (TRUE or FALSE) based upon a single bit input to the machine. (Richards p. 108) Depending on what the input for a condition is, one of the two transfer functions associated with that condition will be executed. The machine considers executing a function to be setting the output of a single pin on the device, this can be used to trigger combinational logic. After a transfer function is executed, the machine will enter a new state, each transfer function will either implicitly or explicitly define a new state to transition to. \nAn implicit state definition could also be called the default, since it will occur without any additional circuitry from the designer, if the condition is YES then it will transition to the next state numerically. For example, if you are at state 0 and a YES occurs then you will transition to state 1. If the condition is NO, then the machine will remain at its current state. Using this behavior it is possible to create a machine with a simple sequential flowchart.\nOf course a sequential machine is usually not very useful, thankfully there is a way to transition to states out of order, using a so-called jump. To implement a jump requires additional hardware to select the destination state. The exact hardware depends on the function being executed.\n\nThe Richards controller's core kernel can be boiled down into four parts, a counter, a multiplexer, and two decoders. A simple controller can be built using the classic 7400 series of TTL logic integrated circuits. The counter used is the 74163, the multiplexer is the 74151 and the two decoders are the 7442 part. (Richards, p. 108) The output from the counter selects what bit from the multiplexer input should be sent to the output Y, (the inverse of which is sent to the output WN.) If Y is high, then the counter is allowed to increment, otherwise it is not. Likewise, Y must be high to enable YES function outputs since the D input on the decoder is connected to WN, while it must be low to enable the NO function outputs, since the D input on that decoder is set to Y. To perform a jump, you must set the LDN bit on the counter, and the A, B, C and D inputs. LDN tells the counter to load the value on the A, B, C and D inputs. Using some combinational logic, you can load a value into the counter for certain functions but not others, as well as specifying the state address to be loaded, given what function is active. Doing this is a simple matter of building a table of functions and the states that they should transition to, then finding the Boolean Algebra expression for each bit that makes up the address of the state to be jumped to.\n\n\n", "id": "7706961", "categories": [], "title": "Richards controller"}

Also called a lightwell, it often provides access to the house for tradesmen and deliveries to vaults under the pavement; it stores coal areas.\n\nThe term is most commonly applied to urban houses of the Georgian period in the UK, where it was normal for the service rooms, such as the kitchen, scullery and laundry, to be in the basement. Areas were commonly enclosed for safety reasons by wrought iron or cast iron railings, which became one of the principal decorative features of the astylar terraced houses of this period. Areas are also found in the English and French country house,where basements were popular in the 18th century as a way of accommodating service functions while allowing all four faces of a symmetrical Classical building to relate directly to its landscape setting, as at Mereworth Castle in Kent or The Abbey, Skirwith in Cumberland. Basements, and consequently areas, decreased in popularity in the 19th century, as attitudes to servants changed, although they continued to be constructed as service accommodation in urban settings where land was at a premium until the early 20th century. A suburban residential application can be seen at the Gamble House in Pasadena, California, to light the laundry and service areas of the expansive basement.\n\nIn early 18th-century house descriptions, the area was usually called the \"airy\", which suggests that its primary function was ventilation, needed to prevent cooking smells from percolating upstairs to the rooms above. This implies that the term \"area\" was a corruption of \"airey\" rather than vice versa.\n\nIn North London, it was known colloquially as \"the airey\". It is a subject of an old-time children's ball-bouncing rhyme, which begins: \n\"One, two, three, alairy <br>\nMy ball is down the airey <br>\nDon't forget to give it to Mary<br>\nEarly in the morning\".\n\n\n", "id": "7707059", "categories": ["Building engineering"], "title": "Area (architecture)"}

But after the pre-season pitch examination, the HKFA decided that it was not up to standard for First Division matches and thus no matches were to be held at the ground.\n\nWith a potential 13 teams competing in the 2008-09 season, the HKFA determined that Mong Kok Stadium's pitch would not be able to handle the large number of games scheduled there and once again, suggested the use of Tai Po Sports Ground for Tai Po's home games. The HKFA's schedule for the first half of the 2008-09 season has shown that Tai Po has been granted the rights to play six of its home games here.\n\nOn 13 September 2008, Tai Po played its second ever home game at the sports ground against Sheffield United. 1,136 fans attended the game.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7707147", "text": "Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959\n\nThe Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959 were agreed between the polluting Chisso company and representative groups of fishermen and Minamata disease patients who had been affected by mercury pollution. The agreements and their formation shared a number of common characteristics. They were formulated outside the legal system, by ad-hoc mediation committees specially established for the purpose. Members of the committees and the final agreements were weighted in favour of Chisso and all included punitive clauses that the groups could make no future claims for compensation against the company.\n\nEver since 1908 when Chisso opened the factory in Minamata wastewater had been dumped into the seas around Minamata, particularly into Minamata Bay via the waste canal outlet in Hyakken Harbour. Damage to fisheries was inevitable and the Minamata Fishing Cooperative had demanded compensation from the company on two occasions previous to the outbreak of Minamata disease. After direct negotiations in 1926 the company agreed to pay \"sympathy money\" to the cooperative of JPY1,500 (USD704). By using the term the company avoided accepting responsibility for the damage and sought to prevent further claims by including a clause in the agreement that the cooperative would \"never again lodge complaints\" against Chisso. This pattern of denial of responsibility and the inclusion of punitive clauses repeated itself again and again in Chisso's dealings with complainants. The pollution continued unabated and another agreement was signed in 1943. This time the cooperative was paid JPY152,500 in compensation for future and past damage to fishing. The cooperative was also forced to acknowledge Chisso's \"importance to the prosperity of Minamata\" and \"the need to cooperate so as not to harm its operations\", indicating the unequal nature of the agreement.\n\nBy the time of the outbreak of Minamata disease the fishing situation had become critical. From 1953 to 1957 the fish catch in Minamata had declined by a staggering 91%. In 1956, the Kumamoto prefectural government had attempted to limit the spread of the disease by banning the \"sale\" of fish caught from Minamata Bay, but did not issue and all-out ban. This left fishermen with fish they could not sell, but no financial assistance to compensate their losses. In September 1958 the Minamata Fishing Cooperative petitioned the prefecture to ban fishing completely so that their members might be properly compensated under the Fisheries Law and Food Sanitation Act. The government did not respond and only advised the fishermen against consumption of the fish and shellfish they caught from the bay. However, with no source of income, many fishermen were left with no choice but to eat the suspect fish they caught. In fact, throughout the history of the Minamata disease problem, the catching of fish from Minamata Bay has never been legally prohibited.\n\nDespite the ban on the sale of contaminated fish, there was still widespread suspicion amongst local people that fish caught in the Minamata area was unsafe and by June 1959 several fish shops had gone out of business from plummeting demand. Desperate, and with no assistance from government, the cooperative was forced into direct negotiations with the company. On 6 August 400 members of the cooperative marched on the factory and in a hostile atmosphere met with factory manager Eiichi Nishida. The fishermen's demand for the cleanup of Minamata Bay, the installation of wastewater treatment facilities and JPY100 million (USD278,000) was met with an offer of \"emergency sympathy money\" to the value of JPY500,000 (USD1,390) and a promise to consult with the company's head office in Tokyo.\n\nFishermen from the cooperative again forced their way into the factory on 12 August to continue negotiations. No agreement could be reached but the two sides did manage to agree to a joint inspection of fishing conditions in Minamata Bay, followed by further talks on 17 August. After this inspection Chisso admitted that fishing was impossible in some areas and made a final offer of JPY13 million (USD36,100). This paltry sum incensed the fishermen. Violence broke out, riot police were called and Nishida and other company employees were effectively held hostage in the factory building. Only after Mayor Todomu Nakamura agreed to mediate between the two sides did the fishermen leave the factory grounds. The mediation committee formed by Mayor Nakamura was stacked heavily in Chisso's favour and presented a decision on 26 August. The company would pay JPY20 million (USD55,600) directly to the cooperative and set up a JPY15 million (USD41,700) fund to promote the recovery of fishing. The proposal was qualified with the ultimatum that if either side rejected, the committee would stop mediation completely. On 29 August the fishing cooperative delivered its response: \"In order to end the anxiety of the citizens, we swallow our tears and accept\". The company also agreed and the first compensation agreement between Chisso and fisherman was complete.\n\nTo the company's disappointment, this first agreement did not bring an end to problems with fishermen. Since Chisso had switched the wastewater output from Minamata Bay to the mouth of Minamata River in September 1958 the environmental damage had spread even further up and down the Shiranui Sea. Cats had started to die in Ashikita to the north and in Izumi to the south of Minamata and new Minamata disease patients were also appearing. The pollution was having a widespread effect on fishing catches and fish sales as people's confidence in the safety of their food evaporated. This drove the Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives to take action of a similar pattern to that taken by the Minamata Fishing Alliance earlier in the year, but on a larger scale. On 17 October, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory demanding direct negotiations with Chisso. When company officials refused, the fishermen forced their way into the factory and attacked the security office, breaking windows and injuring seven guards. Alliance president Ushita Murakami delivered their demands to company manager Nishida, who promised a prompt reply. When the response came, the company said that since the factory's waste had still not been proven as the cause of Minamata disease, and it could offer the fishermen nothing.\n\nUnsatisfied, Murakami and followers travelled to Tokyo and met with officials of numerous government departments to outline their plight. He managed to secure a promise from members of the Diet that they would visit Minamata to investigate the situation. When the Diet party arrived in Minamata on 2 November they were met by a crowd of 4,000 demonstrators (including fishermen and disease victims groups alike) outside the Municipal Hospital. The crowd was extremely respectful to the Diet members and pleaded with them for help. The members thanked the demonstrators for bringing the issue to the attention of the national government and promised they would do all they could.\nEmboldened after their demonstration at the hospital, the alliance fishermen marched on the factory to again demand negotiations. The company refused and the fishermen forced their way in and rioted, attacking many buildings and significantly damaging company property. Riot police arrived and serious fighting continued sporadically for the rest of the day until the fishermen dispersed around 9 pm. Injuries included 30-40 fishermen, two company employees, factory manager Nishida himself, 64 policemen and the chief of police. Damages to company property amounted to JPY10 million (USD27,800). Before the riot the Minamata disease issue had been skirted by the national media and had been chiefly a local issue. The violent riot however was covered widely in the national media and for the first time since the discovery of the disease in 1956 the issue of Minamata disease had nationwide coverage.\n\nA mediation committee headed by Kumamoto Prefecture Governor Hirosaku Teramoto was formed to hammer out a solution. At a meeting on 2 December the prefectural fishing alliance outlined their demands: compensation of JPY2.5 billion (USD6.9 million) for damage to fishing since 1953, the temporary closure of the factory and removal of toxic sludge. The committee then met company executives, including Chisso president Kiichi Yoshioka, who responded with an offer that amounted to \"nearly zero\". After weeks of wrangling the fishing alliance reduced its demands to JPY980 million (USD2.7 million) and Chisso, under increasing pressure from all sides, relaxed its position. The proposed agreement (presented with the ultimatum of no further mediation from the committee should it be rejected, as previously) called for the immediate installation of wastewater treatment facilities, JPY35 million compensation to be paid to the alliance (JPY10 million of which would be deducted to cover the damage caused in the 2 November riots) and a JPY65 million fund for the recovery of the fishing industry. The agreement also included a clause that the alliance could never demand further compensation, even if the factory's waste was proven to be the cause of the damage. The agreement was accepted by both sides on 17 December.\n\nIn 1959, the victims of Minamata disease and their families were in a much weaker position than the fisherman who had extracted at least some \"sympathy money\" from Chisso. The only patients' organisation present at the time of the fishermen's agreements was the Minamata Disease Patients Families Mutual Aid Society, which had only been established in August 1957. They were much fewer in number (in November 1959 the society only represented the 58 families of 78 patients) and the membership of the society was more divided than the relatively united fishermen. One factor driving the division of the patients was the discrimination and ostracism some families were experiencing in the Minamata community. Local people, who were naturally averse to uncleanliness and disease, felt that the company (and their city that depended upon it) was facing economic ruin under the pressure of the various groups making demands of it. Even fishermen, who were fellow victims of the company's pollution, discriminated against disease victims because they were stoking fears that prevented the sale of their fish. To some patients this ostracism from the community represented a greater fear than the disease itself.\n\nIn a similar fashion to the fishermen's associations, the Mutual Aid Society began by petitioning the city and prefectural governments and visited Kumamoto city on 21 November. When their petitions produced no results, the society approached Chisso directly and demanded compensation of JPY234 million (USD650,000) – JPY3 million (USD8,300) per person. On 28 November the company replied that the link between the factory's wastewater and Minamata disease had not been proven and could, therefore, offer them nothing but an expression of sympathy. The society began a sit-in at the company gates, which was to last a whole month.\n\nAround 50 members of the society travelled to Kumamoto on 1 December and made a request to Governor Teramoto to include the patients' request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance. He agreed to consult with the company and when the mediation committee presented its deal to the fishing alliance on 16 December, it also presented a proposal for \"sympathy\" payments to the Mutual Aid Society, even though no representatives had been present on the mediation committee. The proposal amounted to a total compensation package of JPY74 million. The money would be allocated to patients certified by a committee to be established by the Ministry of Health and Welfare as follows: adult patients would receive JPY100,000 (USD278) and children JPY10,000 (USD28) per year; families of dead patients would receive a JPY320,000 (USD889) payment. Society leader Eizō Watanabe agreed that the overall level of compensation was acceptable but rejected the plan over the staggered schedule of payments and the very small sum being offered for child victims.\n\nThe mediation committee reconvened on 25 December and agreed to increase the child payments to JPY30,000 (USD83) per child. The Mutual Aid Society held a vote of its members but the agreement was rejected by a single vote. Society leader Watanabe offered his resignation in protest but when another vote was held on 27 December members accepted the agreement and his resignation was withdrawn. As usual, the agreement did not admit responsibility for Minamata disease. The payments were \"sympathy money\" and the agreement included a clause that, \"Even if in the future it is determined that the cause of Minamata disease \"is\" the factory's wastewater, [the patients] will make absolutely no further demands for compensation\", along with an extra clause that, \"If in the future it is determined that the cause of Minamata disease is \"not\" the factory's wastewater, the company shall end payments at the end of that month.\" The final agreement was accepted by both sides on 29 December 1959.\n\n", "id": "7707147", "categories": ["1959 in the environment", "Pollution in Japan", "Minamata disease", "Political scandals in Japan", "1959 disasters", "1959 in Japan", "Environmental law in Japan", "Environmental disasters in Japan"], "title": "Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959"}

Vertigo Entertainment, Lee's production company in Beverly Hills, California, has a first-look deal with Warner Bros.\n\nLee was born in 1969 at Wyckoff Heights Hospital, in Brooklyn, New York, to Korean parents. His father, a doctor, and his mother, had been in America for just three years and were still acclimating. Lee's mother, a devout Christian, nurtured hopes that he would become a minister.\n\nLee graduated Walter Johnson High School in 1987. During his undergraduate studies at George Washington University, Lee interned at the law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson. After graduating GWU, Lee attended law school at American University Washington College of Law where he prepared for a career in corporate law.\n\nIn 1996, after graduating law school at American University and working at Fried Frank for eight months, he moved to Los Angeles and worked as a \"tracker\" at a production company called Alphaville. Trackers monitor spec material and dealmaking. At the time, trackers shared information over the phone, constantly updating each other in an endless cycle of calls.\n\nOne of Lee's \"tracker\" friends, Polly Cohen Johnsen, had been updating the story department at Jersey Films and had the idea to put their tracking group online. Lee joined forces with Johnsen and Glenn Gregory of Propaganda Films to convert their daily phone calls into an online tracking group. In 1997 Lee set up an Internet bulletin board called Tracker for twenty of his friends, who rated scripts and posted pertinent tracker information for each.\n\nWithin six months, Lee had established twenty-five online groups for other trackers at production companies and studios in Hollywood. Since he was the only member who belonged to every group, he had the best information. Lee's project changed the spec script market forever. While spec scripts and pitches continued to sell, weaker material was dismissed more quickly, often within a single day, to the frustration of many agents. Online tracking accelerated the market, brought more honesty, allowed development execs to sift for material more effectively and put more pressure on agents and producers to represent better material.\n\nIn 1999, Lee went to work with BenderSpink, a talent-management company owned by two of his friends, Chris Bender and JC Spink. He was charged with finding Internet content: short films that would play on personal computers. In this same year, Ed Kashiba and Lee developed the company Scriptshark.com, an online method for novice screenwriters to have their scripts assessed and potentially. They later added partner Sean Connolly, and eventually sold the site to iFilm in 2001. iFilm later sold Scriptshark.com to The New York Times. Scriptshark only closed in 2016.\n\nIn the fall of 2001, after setting up film projects at all the major studios, Lee left BenderSpink and joined Doug Davison to create Vertigo Entertainment. When working on a project together, Lee did the selling and Davison handled the follow-up work. Lee noted that in the beginning, the hardest thing was making contacts abroad.\n\nLee's approach to making deals involved explaining to Asian distributors that their films would probably not sell in America because of their subtitles and that they would make more money by selling remake rights. Then he assured the rights holder that he would protect them by representing them for free (the American studio would pay his fee when the film was made). Once Lee had secured the right to negotiate for an Asian company, he told the studios to regard the film as a script that someone had taken the trouble to film, and that had been tested and proved a hit in its home country.\n\nLee earned his first motion picture producing credit on Gore Verbinski's 2002 blockbuster \"The Ring\". He went on to produce the 2004 haunted house horror film \"The Grudge\", which starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and was based on the 2002 Japanese film \"\", which was directed by Takashi Shimizu. The box office hit held the record for biggest horror opening weekend following its October 2004 release.\n\n\"The Grudge 2\" was released in October 2006, starring Amber Tamblyn and Gellar, and directed by Shimizu. It topped the box office at $22 million on its opening weekend. Also in October 2006, \"The Departed\", a crime thriller from Warner Bros., directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson, was released, grossing $27 million in its opening weekend. It was Scorsese's biggest opening ever. \"The Departed\" later went on to win Best Picture at the 79th Academy Awards.\n\nHe worked as executive producer of the Uruguay short film \"Ataque de Pánico!\" alongside Doug Davison.\n\n", "id": "7707155", "categories": ["American people of Korean descent", "American film producers", "Living people", "Washington College of Law alumni", "American film production company founders", "People from Brooklyn", "1969 births", "George Washington University alumni"], "title": "Roy Lee"}

In oil refineries, traps are used to prevent hydrocarbons and other dangerous gases and chemical fumes from escaping through drains.\n\nIn domestic applications, traps are typically U, S, Q, or J-shaped pipe located below or within a plumbing fixture. An S-shaped trap is also known as an S-bend. It was invented by Alexander Cumming in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880. The U-bend could not jam, so, unlike the S-bend, it did not need an overflow. The most common of these traps is referred to as a P-trap. It is the addition of a 90 degree fitting on the outlet side of a U-bend, thereby creating a P-like shape (oriented horizontally). It is also referred to as a sink trap because it is installed under most sinks.\n\nBecause of its shape, the trap retains some water after the fixture's use. This water creates an air seal that prevents sewer gas from passing from the drain pipes back into the building. Essentially all plumbing fixtures including sinks, bathtubs, and showers must be equipped with either an internal or external trap. Toilets almost always have an internal trap.\n\nBecause it is a localized low-point in the plumbing, sink traps also tend to capture dense objects (such as jewelry or coins) inadvertently dropped down the sink. Traps also tend to collect hair, sand, food waste and other debris and limit the size of objects that enter the plumbing system, thereby catching oversized objects. For all of these reasons, most traps may be disassembled for cleaning or provide a cleanout feature.\n\nWhere a volume of water may be rapidly discharged through the trap, a standpipe may be required to minimize impact to other nearby traps.\n\nAn S-shaped trap is also known as an S-bend. It was invented by Alexander Cumming in 1775 but became known as the U-bend following the introduction of the U-shaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880. The new U-bend could not jam, so, unlike the S-bend, it did not need an overflow.\n\nOnce invented, despite being simple and reasonably reliable, widespread use was slow coming. In Britain, the requirement to use traps was introduced only after the Great Stink in London, in the summer of 1858, when the objectionable smell of the River Thames, which was effectively an open sewer, affected the nearby Houses of Parliament. That motivated the legislators to authorise the construction of a modern sewerage system in the city, of which the S-bend was an essential component. , only about two-thirds of the world population have access to traps, in spite of the evidence that good sewage systems significantly improve economic productivity in places that employ them.\n\nMaintaining the water seal is critical to trap operation; traps might dry out, and poor venting can suction or blow water out of the traps. This is usually avoided by venting the drain pipes downstream of the trap; by being vented to the atmosphere outside the building, the drain lines never operate at a pressure much higher or lower than atmospheric pressure. Plumbing codes usually provide strict limitations on how far a trap may be located from the nearest \"vent stack\".\n\nWhen a vent cannot be provided, codes may allow the use of an air admittance valve instead. These devices avoid negative pressure in the drain pipe by venting room air into the drain pipe (behind the trap). A \"Chicago Loop\" is another alternative.\n\nWhen a trap is installed on a fixture that is not routinely used—such as a floor drain—the eventual evaporation of the water in the trap must be considered. In these cases, a trap primer may be installed; these are devices that automatically recharge traps with water to maintain their water seals.\n\nIn some regions of the United States, \"S\" traps are no longer accepted by the plumbing codes as these traps tend to siphon dry even when well vented. It may be possible to determine whether a household uses an S- or U-bend by the presence of an overflow pipe outlet. What is required instead is a P-trap with proper venting. Certain drum-styled traps are also discouraged or banned.\n", "id": "7707347", "categories": ["Plumbing"], "title": "Trap (plumbing)"}

The first atlas was published in 1877 with the name \"Bos' Schoolatlas der geheele aarde (Bos's School Atlas of the Whole Earth)\". Later editions were named \"Bosatlas\". Bos continued to look after the production of the atlas until his death in 1902: his final production was the 15th edition. The last of his successors to take individual responsibility for the Atlas was F.J.Ormeling (1976–1981). Since 1981 responsibility for the atlas has been collectively attributed and it is the publisher's name that has been highlighted in the atlas and associated marketing material.\n\nThe reason for first publication was the introduction of geography in (former) Dutch high schools. The maps were originally drawn by hand. The publisher was Jan Berend Wolters of Groningen, whose firm continues to publish the atlas as .\n\nDifferent versions of the atlas are (or were) published, as follows. \n\nIn November 2009, a Frisian edition, \"De Bosatlas van Fryslân\" was published, completely dedicated to the Dutch province of Friesland, with historical and modern maps, aerophotography, background information on hundreds of topics and a complete set of topographical maps, scale (1:25 000).\n\nEditions of the atlas have also been published in Belgium (both Dutch and French), France, Sweden and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The standard \"Grote Bosatlas\", although a world atlas, provides a greatly extended level of detail and variety in respect of the Netherlands.

The goal is to examine and describe the links between the cognition and behavior – how an individual's thoughts get transformed into action. It was developed by John Greene.\n\nAction assembly theory describes the production of behavior in two essential processes: \n\nThe idea of procedural record is at the center of action assembly. These records contain information about action, outcomes, and situations. These records are locked in the individual’s memory where it remembers past behaviors for the future.\n\nA procedural record is at the center of action assembly. It is a personal nugget of truth about past behavior stockpiled for future use, part of an individual's memory system in which information about how to execute various behaviors is stored. Procedural records contain information about action, outcomes, and situations; for example, traveling at excessive speed (action) in a zone that specifies low speed limit (situation)can result in the issuance of a ticket (outcome).\n\nProcedural records have different levels of strength. Some are mere scratches that barely leave a trace in the mind, while others are well-worn into long-term memory.\n\nA central aspect of the action assembly theory is specifying the processes that link procedural records to behavioral representations. The activation process is the process used to select particular procedural records. For example, if a parent disciplined a child for stealing, all procedural records relevant to this goal and situation would be activated. In turn, if a common disciplinary tactic was to take away toys and play items, a procedural record of that would be activated quickly.\n\nIt is also important to consider the process of assembly, which organizes records into a behavioral representation. For example, assembly is considered a top-down process that begins with general strategy and goes to more specific ideas about communicating the specific message.\n\nAction assembly theory has been useful for topics such as speech onset latency and hesitations during speaking. These concepts are assumed to be indicators of cognitive processing. Another use is the study of planning – individuals who plan more effectively are more fluent than those do not, because planning reduces the cognitive load at the time of message production.\n\nWhen an interaction situation has multiple goals, the theory finds increased demands on an individual's information processing capacity. Assembly of goals may be difficult because a specific goals may be incompatible with behaviors associated with the other goals. In turn, multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitations and latencies. The utilization of Action Assembly theory can provide a clear opportunity to plan or assemble goals more careful to mitigate the effect.\n\nWhen an interaction situation has multiple goals, the theory finds increased demands on an individual’s information processing capacity.

Each episode is an eclectic, freeform mix of blues, folk, rockabilly, R&B, soul, bebop, rock-and-roll, country and pop music, centered on a theme such as \"Weather,\" \"Money,\" and \"Flowers\" with songs from artists as diverse as Patti Page and LL Cool J. Much of the material for the show's 100 episodes was culled from producer Eddie Gorodetsky's music collection, which reportedly includes more than 10,000 records and more than 140,000 digital files.\n\nInterspersed between the music segments were email readings, listener phone calls, vintage radio air checks, old radio promos and jingles, even older jokes from Dylan (\"My grandmother is so tidy she puts newspaper under the cuckoo clock\"), poetry recitations; taped messages from a variety of celebrities, musicians and comedians; and commentary from Dylan on the music and musicians as well as miscellanea related to the themes. The show was not live (Dylan taped his portions at various locations and while touring), and the studio location at the so-called \"Abernathy Building\" was fictitious. Most of the \"listener phone calls\" and emails were also fictitious, although at least one email read on the show came from an actual listener.\n\nThe first episode of \"TTRH\" was broadcast on May 3, 2006 on the Deep Tracks channel of XM Satellite Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service, now called Sirius XM Radio after its purchase and merger with competitor Sirius Satellite Radio. \"TTRH\" was originally broadcast every Wednesday at 10:00 am ET on Deep Tracks, with several \"encore\" repeats throughout the week on various channels, including an all-day airing on what was XMX Channel 2.\n\nOn November 12, 2008, Sirius XM revised its channel lineup, providing Sirius and XM listeners with access to programming on both networks. As of that date, \"TTRH\" began airing every Wednesday at 11 am ET on Deep Tracks – Channel 40 on XM and Channel 16 on Sirius. Several channels on both stations were discontinued in November 2008, including XMX Channel 2, which had aired \"TTRH\" all day on Wednesdays.\n\nThe show was simulcast on DirecTV until February 9, 2010.\n\nFrom 2006 through 2008 AOL Radio offered the show on \"AOL Radio featuring XM,\" a selection of 200 XM radio stations that was available to those with an AOL login and a broadband internet connection. In March 2008, XM Radio and America Online announced that they were ending that relationship \"by mutual agreement\" and at the end of April, 2008 the XM Radio channels were no longer available on AOL Radio.\n\nFrom 2007–9 the program aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6 Music, and in Ireland on Dublin-based alternative rock station Phantom FM.\n\nSeason 3 of \"TTRH\" concluded with the show's 100th original episode on April 15, 2009.

It was set down plainly in the Law of the Twelve Tables as follows:\nThe Law of the Twelve Tables orders that he who has stirred up an enemy or who has handed over a citizen to the enemy is to be punished capitally. (Marcianus, D. 48, 4, 3) .\n\nUnder the terms of this law, those convicted of \"perduellio\" were subject to death either by being hanged from the \"arbor infelix\" (a tree deemed to be unfortunate) or by being thrown from the Tarpeian Rock. Their families were not allowed to mourn them and their houses were razed.\n\nAs the concept of national sovereignty took hold in Rome, \"perduellio\" also came to mean an offense which “injured or brought into danger the dignity, supremacy, and power of the commonwealth [Roman State]”. This included such things as losing an army, violating the rights of the tribunes of the plebs, or usurping a function of the State (as in the case of Horatius).\n\nIn the \"Ab Urbe Condita\", Livy recorded the first instance of both a trial of \"perduellio\" and appeal:\n\nIt enraged the fiery youth to hear his sister’s lamentations in the hour of his own victory and the nation’s great rejoicing. And so, drawing his sword and at the same time angrily upbraiding her, he ran her through the body…The king…said: “In accordance with the law I appoint duumvirs to pass judgment upon Horatius for treason [perduellio]. The dread formula or the law ran thus: ‘Let the duumvirs pronounce him guilty of treason; if he shall appeal from the duumvirs, let the appeal be tried; if the duumvirs win, let the lictor veil his head, let [the lictor] suspend him with a rope from a barren tree [\"arbor infelix\"]; let [the lictor] scourge him either within or without the \"pomerium\".’ Even though the duumvirs found Horatius guilty, Horatius was allowed to appeal (to the people) and by them was acquitted. However, Horatius’ father had to perform expiatory rites and Horatius himself was forced to pass under the yoke. \n\nBut over time with the expansion of the rights of Roman citizens, the use of corporal punishment lessened until the time of Augustus when conviction only carried with it the punishment of \"aquae et ignis interdictio\" (exile).\n\nThe trial was conducted by the \"duumviri perduellionis\", who during the Monarchy were appointed by the king. Later on during the Republic they were proposed by the consuls and formally appointed by the \"comitia\" (\"comitia curiata\" or \"comitia centuriata\"). The judgement of the \"duumviri\" was subject to appeal, which generally was tried by the \"comitia centuriata\" unlike in Horatius' trial. The prosecution was led by tribunes or aediles.\n\nBy the late Republic, the archaic \"perduellio\" had become largely obsolete, though it could still be used (see Gaius Rabirius). Its offenses were covered by the law of \"maiestas\" which included a broader range of crimes. \"Perduellio\" became the designation for a particularly odious type of \"maiestas\".\n", "id": "7707477", "categories": [], "title": "Perduellio"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7707575", "text": "Radomir Putnik\n\nField Marshal Radomir Putnik (; ; 24 January 1847 – 17 May 1917) was the first Serbian Field Marshal and Chief of the General Staff of the Serbian army in the Balkan Wars and in the First World War. He took part in all of the wars in which Serbia took part between 1876 to 1917.\n\nThe Putnik family was originally from Kosovo, but fled the region to the Habsburg Monarchy during the Great Serb Migration of 1690. The family decided to return from exile to the Principality of Serbia, the first modern Serbian polity independent of Ottoman rule in the mid-19th century. Putnik's father, Dimitrije, was a teacher in Kragujevac, and Radomir completed his basic schooling there. He attended the Artillery School (the precursor to what would eventually become the Military Academy) in Belgrade, where he graduated in 1863, placing eighth in his class. In 1879, he married Ljubica Bojović, the sister of , who later became Minister of Military Affairs and daughter of Colonel Todor Bojević and Jelena Tadić, with whom he had seven children (three daughters and four sons). Contemporaries describe Putnik as an ascetic, introverted man, and a heavy smoker; however, he also had decided views on professional issues. He proved himself on the battlefield during Serbia's wars against the Ottomans fought between 1876 and 1877. It was a military force under his command that took Gnjilane and Gračanica from the Ottomans in Kosovo, during the closing stages of the second Serbo-Ottoman War (1877-1878. The Serbian troops, under Major Putnik, were obliged to pull back to Merdare in order to meet a stipulation in the general armistice between Russian and the Ottomans. Putnik was noted for being a self-righteous and demanding officer prone to strongly defending his point of view.\n\nPutnik became a professor in the Military Academy, holding that position from 1886 to 1895. In 1889, he was appointed as the Deputy Chief of the General Staff. However, he soon came into conflict with King Milan I, partly for not allowing a protégé of the king to pass an examination. Political intrigue and latent conflict with King Milan Obrenović and his successor, King Alexander I, would hinder his advancement throughout this part of his career. In 1895 he was forced to retire by the king, under suspicion of sympathy for the Radical party of Nikola Pašić.\n\nPutnik was rehabilitated following the coup d'etat against Alexander I Obrenović in 1903. Under the new king of Serbia, Peter I Karadjordjević, he was promoted to the rank of general and appointed as the Chief of the General Staff. He then proceeded to completely reorganize the Serbian army by retiring old and promoting new officers, and updating outdated war plans. Putnik was Serbian Minister of War three times: 1904, 1906-1908, 1912. Putnik appointed General Živojin Mišić as his deputy. Despite occasional personality clashes, the two men had deep respect for each other. Putnik was the first officer to be appointed to the highest rank of Field Marshal. In 1912, he led the Serbian Army into spectacular victories in the First Balkan War against the Ottomans (Battle of Kumanovo, October 1912, Battle of Monastir, November 1912) and the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria (Battle of Bregalnica 1913). Field-Marshal Putnik, expecting Bulgarian attack, had deployed his troops on the most important strategic points near the river Bregalnica (Bregalnitza), which was essential for a quick victory after the sudden, unannounced Bulgarian attack.\n\nCaught in Budapest when Austria-Hungary declared war upon his country, Field Marshal Putnik was allowed safe passage back to Serbia in a chivalrous and possibly self-defeating gesture by the Austro-Hungarian emperor Franz Josef. After a troublesome trip, Putnik returned to Serbia and offered his resignation to King Peter I of Serbia on the grounds of age and ill health. It was rejected, the king insisting that Field Marshal Putnik take command over the army, if only in a strategic sense, while younger generals, such as Stepa Stepanović, Živojin Mišić and Petar Bojović would take over operational duties. Putnik had to spend most of his time in a well-heated room. However, his impaired health did not prevent him from successfully organizing the campaign. Serbia defeated the Austro-Hungarian Army's offensives in August and September 1914 (battles of Cer and Kolubara), driving it out of Serbia by December 1914.\n\nThe Serbian front then remained relatively quiet until autumn 1915, when joint Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian forces, led by German Field Marshal August von Mackensen, began a large offensive against Serbia with more than 300,000 soldiers. Before the joint attack, Putnik warned the Serbian government that Bulgaria was concentrating her troops at the eastern Serbian borders and that a preventive attack on Bulgaria was the only chance for Serbia to avoid fighting on two fronts. His demand was rejected due to the wishes of the Allies, who were still hoping to isolate Bulgaria from joining the Triple Alliance. Despite heroic resistance, the Serbian troops were obliged to retreat towards Kosovo. On 31 October Putnik ordered a general retreat onto Kragujevac, attempting to keep his exhausted army together as it sought to escape into friendly territory. Many of Putnik's soldiers were farmers, who occasionally slipped away from the retiring army to resume their rural lives. Putnik's rapidly declining forces continued their withdrawal towards Albania during the first week of November 1915, a process aided by the fact that the Germans, Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians were reluctant to pursue Serbian troops through the highlands of Albania. The Germans felt that the war against Serbia was won, with most of the nation under the control of the Central Powers. Regarding the Russian Empire as the main threat in the East, Mackensen was eager to move his forces back to the Russian front. The Bulgarians were satisfied with their territorial gains in Macedonia and southeast Serbia, while the Austro-Hungarians were equally content with the notion that the Bulgarians were not moving to establish a Greater Bulgaria. The final confrontation occurred in Kosovo, the Field of the Blackbirds, between 19 and 24 November 1915. The Serbs were afflicted by a new outbreak of typhus, while food and ammunition was in extremely short supply. Facing inevitable defeat Putnik made his last and most painful order on 25 November — full retreat, southwards and westwards through Montenegro and into Albania. His goal was to reach allied ships that would, he hoped, transport the core of the army to the safety of the Ionian islands. Many of the fleeing soldiers and civilians died during the retreat to the coast - lost to hunger, disease, attacks by enemy forces and Albanian tribal bands. The circumstances of the retreat were disastrous, and all told, some 155,000 Serbs, out of 250,000 mostly soldiers, eventually reached the coast of the Adriatic Sea, and embarked on Allied transport ships that carried the army to various Greek islands (many to Corfu) before being deployed at the Salonika front in April 1916. In worsening health, Putnik had to be carried in a sedan chair during the retreat through snowy mountains of Albania, exhausted by the effort and episodes of bronchitis, influenza and pneumonia. Putnik was met by allied forces in Scutari (Skadar) and transported first to Brindisi and then to Corfu, along with the core of the army.\n\nIn the atmosphere of recrimination that followed between the Serbian Government and the High Command, the entire General Staff was dismissed in January 1916, including Field Marshal Putnik. He felt embittered, having learned of his dismissal from a cashier who gave him his salary without a Chief of General Staff's supplement. He traveled to Nice, where the French authorities welcomed him with honors and gave him a villa. Putnik was overcome by lung emphysema and died on 17 May 1917 without seeing his homeland again. His remains were transferred to Serbia in November 1926 and buried with honors in a chapel at Belgrade's New Cemetery. The grave carries the epitaph \"Grateful Homeland to Radomir Putnik\".\n\nMount Putnik in Alberta, Canada was named after him in 1918 for his exceptional services to the allied cause. He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7707575", "categories": ["Recipients of the Order of the Crown (Romania)", "Recipients of the Order of Saint Stanislaus (Russian), 1st class", "Serbian military personnel of the Balkan Wars", "Field marshals", "1847 births", "Grand Crosses of the Order of St. Sava", "Grand Officiers of the Légion d'honneur", "Recipients of the Order of Military Merit (Bulgaria)", "1917 deaths", "Serbian soldiers", "Serbian military personnel of World War I", "People from the Principality of Serbia", "Grand Crosses of the Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)", "People from Kragujevac", "Grand Officers of the Order of the Crown (Romania)", "Honorary Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George", "Recipients of the Order of the Cross of Takovo", "Recipients of the Medal for Bravery (Serbia)", "Chiefs of the Serbian General Staff", "People of the Serbo-Bulgarian War"], "title": "Radomir Putnik"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7707591", "text": "Thomas Hinde\n\nDoctor Thomas Hinde (July 10, 1737 – September 28, 1828) was Northern Kentucky's first physician, a member of the British Royal Navy, an American Revolutionary, personal physician to Patrick Henry, and treated General Wolfe when he died in Quebec, Canada.\n\nThomas Hinde is the patriarch of the Hinde family in the United States. His youngest son, Thomas S. Hinde, was a notable Methodist minister and businessman, Charles T. Hinde, his grandson, was a shipping magnate, and Edmund C. Hinde, another grandson, was an adventurer. The Kavanaugh and Southgate branches of his family held elected office and positions of leadership in the Methodist church.\n\nAs personal physician to Patrick Henry, Hinde played a critical role in the American Revolutionary War through his vaccinations against smallpox and treatment of wounded soldiers. For his service he received a large land grant in Kentucky, where he moved with his family. Hinde was northern Kentucky's first physician, and a memorial was erected in Campbell County, Kentucky to honor his services to the state. He died in 1828 aged 91, which was unusually old for the time. According to Otto Juettner in 1909, who was a famous medical doctor and medical historian, Hinde \"never wrote a line in his life.\" His life has been described as being like a \"romance\", and he was called a \"patriarch\" to the American medical profession.\n\nHinde was born in Oxfordshire, England, in July 1737. He received a classical education in Oxfordshire and, after completing his studies, was sent to London, England to study medicine. He studied physics and surgery under Dr Thomas Brooke at Saint Thomas Hospital in London and, at the age of nineteen, was presented to the Company of Surgeons for a licence. Shortly after, he was commissioned as a Surgeons' Mate in the Royal Navy and sailed for America with the forces commanded by General Amherst. After landing in New York on June 10, 1757, he spent time at Halifax and Louisbourg. Hinde spent the winter of 1758 in Halifax and assisted Amherst with the reduction of Louisburg. He was attached to the ship which bore the commander in chief, General James Wolfe, on his way to Quebec.\n\nWolfe died in Hinde's arms during the 1759 Battle of Quebec of the Seven Years' War. According to one source, Hinde's relationship with General Wolfe and his experiences in Quebec were some of the most \"cherished\" experiences of his life. A painting of the death shows Dr Hinde compressing a wound to General Wolfe's torso.It is an oil on canvas of the Enlightenment period. Benjamin West, who painted it, made a nearly identical painting of the same scene for King George III in 1771. After Wolfe's death, Hinde remained in the British Navy and was present for the reduction of Bell'isle. Shortly after, Hinde was promoted and remained as a physician for a warship after the peace of 1763. He eventually resigned his commission.\n\nCopies of \"The Death of General Wolfe\" by West are currently in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada, the Royal Ontario Museum (Canadiana art collection), the William L. Clements Library at the University of Michigan and at Ickworth House, Suffolk, England.\n\nAfter the fall of Quebec, Hinde returned briefly to England. Peace with France was reached in 1763, and Hinde then returned to Virginia and settled. He formed a close friendship with an unnamed Virginian who persuaded him to settle in a place called Hobbs Hole in Essex County, Virginia and practice medicine. Another source states that an aged physician in Virginia wrote to Dr Thomas Brooke, Hinde's mentor, asking Brooke to send a young physician to assist him in his practice. Brooke reportedly choose Hinde and \"earnestly advised\" him to \"avail himself of the situation which was offered\". Hinde accepted, but moved soon after to settle in Newton, now in West Virginia, where he met his wife. After their wedding Hinde moved again and settled in Hanover County, Virginia.\n\nIn 1765, after he settled in Virginia, Hinde became acquainted with Patrick Henry one of the founding fathers of the United States, Samuel Davis, and Lord Dunmore. Two years later he married Mary T. Hubbard, settled near Henry, and became his family physician. His association with Henry and settlement in Virginia helped Hinde become acquainted with many of the leading members of society during the period. When Hinde first met Hubbard, he found her to \"possess a great flow of animal spirits, full of humor, gay and lively inner temperament and disposition, with strong powers of mind, and at the same time active and sociable\". The couple married on September 24, 1767. According to a biography written by George Coles in 1857, Henry's statesmanlike eloquence and political principles made a strong impression on Hinde and shifted him from being a staunch royalist to a \"sturdy republican\".\n\nHinde took an active part in the American Revolutionary War serving as a surgeon with Patrick and in various campaigns and battles. At the time of the 1775 Gunpowder Incident, Hinde was Chief Surgeon for Patrick Henry. His involvement in it was the turning point that led him to embrace the cause of the oppressed colonies against Lord Dunmore and the English royalty. The Gunpowder Incident was a conflict early in the American Revolutionary War, between Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia, and militia led by Henry. Hinde originally planned to take a front-line post in Henry's regiment, but when Henry was elected Governor, Hinde was instead appointed to inoculate all members of the continental service. Because of insufficient funds in the continental army, Hinde was forced to cover the costs of inoculations, which \"seriously impaired his private fortune\". One source states that Hinde amputated limbs during the war by the \"cart-load\". After the war, Hinde continued to live in Hanover County for many years, primarily practicing medicine.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, Hinde moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky, having received a large land grant for his services in the war. One source describes the land grant as follows:\nAt the close of the war, having drawn no part of his salary, and from his great skill as a surgeon having endeared himself to the Virginians, in settling up his accounts he was presented with a land warrant, to be located in lands selected in Kentucky, leaving a blank within the warrant for the number of acres to filled by Dr Hinde himself. The blank was filled with twenty thousand, and placed in the hands of Patrick Henry to select and locate the lands.\n\nFor undisclosed reasons, Henry was unable to complete the land grant to Hinde due to surveying difficulties, who then used his nephew Hubbard Taylor to go to Kentucky, find the location, and complete the transaction. Hinde gave Taylor half of the lands for this service. The land was in Clark County, Kentucky, between Winchester and Lexington.\n\nDuring his early years in England, Hinde was a member of the Church of England, but he abandoned the church as an adult and had become a Deist. One biographer stated that for a time Hinde \"took pride and pleasure in ridiculing Christianity\". In later years, however, his religious views \"underwent a radical change\".\n\nIn 1798, Methodist ministers arrived in Hinde's neighborhood and began to convert people. Susanna, one of Hinde's daughters, converted, causing distress to the family. Hinde banished her from his home, and she went to live with her aunt forty miles away. However, this failed because the aunt had already converted, and Hinde's wife converted soon after. Hinde became convinced that the disorder was in their heads, and treated them with medical procedures of the day, such as a \"blistering plaster to the whole length of the spine, which he left on for several days\". Drake states that, through this \"measure of violence, he hoped to deter her from further attendance at places of public worship\". The procedures were painful, but his wife stated afterwards that \"it was a punishment, but I never was so happy in all my life\". Hinde later felt guilt for having banished his daughter and performed medical operations on his wife, and he converted to Methodism. His daughter returned home and his wife began attending Methodist gatherings regularly. Two of his daughters married traveling preachers, and another daughter converted to Methodism too. By the end of his life, Hinde was a devout Methodist. According to one account:\nAt another time he was taking a morning walk and met Gen. James Taylor, a relative by marriage, who said, 'Good-morning, doctor; where are you going?' 'I am going to heaven; where are you going, general?'

The grandchildren called them \"Grandpa's prayer-houses\". Hinde could be heard praying from a \"considerable distance\".\n\nHinde married Mary Todd Hubbard, the daughter of Benjamin Hubbard, an English merchant, and they were married for 61 years. They had eight children that lived to adulthood. His daughter Ann Winston Hinde married Richard Southgate on July 30, 1799, in Newport, Kentucky. Hinde and his family were members of the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church in Newport, Kentucky.\n\nOne of Hinde's sons was Thomas S. Hinde, who was a cofounder of Mount Carmel, Illinois, and became a well-respected Methodist minister. Hinde's grandson Captain Charles T. Hinde was a successful businessman and riverboat captain. Charles was one of the principal investors in the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, California, and inspired Frederick Hinde Zimmerman, Dr Hinde's great-grandson, to build the Grand Rapids Hotel in Mount Carmel, Illinois.\n\nIn his later life, Hinde lived with his daughter Mary McKinney of Newport, Kentucky.\n\n\n", "id": "7707591", "categories": ["American military doctors", "Religious skeptics", "History of the Midwestern United States", "American pioneers", "American planters", "American deists", "American gardeners", "English emigrants to the United States", "Physicians in the American Revolution", "People from Oxfordshire", "American folklore", "American hunters", "American explorers", "Physicians from Kentucky", "Virginia colonial people", "1828 deaths", "People from Newport, Kentucky", "18th-century English medical doctors", "1737 births", "English Methodists", "History of Methodism in the United States"], "title": "Thomas Hinde"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7707646", "text": "Panurge (opera)\n\nPanurge is an opera (titled 'Haulte farce musicale') in three acts by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Georges Spitzmuller and Maurice Boukay, after \"Pantagruel\" by Rabelais. It was first performed at the Théâtre de la Gaîté in Paris on 25 April 1913, nearly a year after Massenet's death, one of three operas by the composer to have premiered posthumously, the others being \"Cléopâtre\" (1914) and \"Amadis\" (1922).\n\nIt is one of Massenet's least known operas, but was revived at the Massenet Festival in St. Etienne in 1994 under conductor Patrick Fournillier. Harding quotes a reaction of Alfred Bruneau who declared that the libretto was not suited to Massenet's temperament and demanded music not of a Massenet, but of a Chabrier.\n\nA crowd of townspeople have gathered outside the tavern of Alcofibras, the 'Hostellerie du Coq à l’Asne' in Les Halles on Mardi Gras. Pantagruel and his squires order wine. Panurge has entered and Pantagruel beckons the hungry newcomer to join his party. Panurge addresses his host in Italian, German, and finally French. Panurge claims that he has lost his wife, Colombe, that very morning and can’t decide whether to laugh or cry. The others encourage him to drown his sorrows in wine. \nOnce everyone has entered the tavern, Colombe herself comes along and hears the voice of her husband; she explains that she feigned death to escape his drunken behaviour. She calls on him to come out and presents herself to him but he says that he does not recognize her. Enraged, Colombe is held by Pantagruel’s squires, while Parnuge escapes with Pantagruel to a monastery where he can hide from his wife.\n\nAt daybreak in the main courtyard of the Abbaye de Thélème, Thelemites and Ribaude greet the morning. When the crowd has left, Panurge enters, pleased with such a congenial refuge and makes advances to Ribaude. Pantagruel arrives with his followers and Jean welcomes as an old friend, describing the customs of the monastery, where there is no Lent and monks pray to Bacchus and nuns to Venus.\nColombe also now enters, having followed her husband to the abbey, and meets Ribaude who lets her know that Panurge was courting her only just before.\nA large meal is prepared in the courtyard by the servants; instead of saying grace, Pantagruel only praises the vine. Panurge wonders whether he should remarry as he can’t recall his former wife, and asks for counsel from the philosopher Brid'oye, the poet Raminagrobis and the physician Rondibilis.\nWhen Ribaude re-enters Panurge tries to flirt with her again, but is spurned by Ribaude who knows that he is married. Colombe sits at Pantagruel’s table and makes confession to Panurge disguised as a monk, of all her transgressions. Panurge cannot contain his jealousy and tells her that he knows the husband, who has fled to the Ile des Lanternes. Colombe says that she will pursue him and leaves, while in a fury Panurge breaks everything at the tables.\n\nColombe, dressed as a priestess and oracle of Bacchus, tells the Queen of the Lanternois how she misses her husband. Panurge arrives, looking for his wife; Queen Baguenaude invites him to rest awhile and consult the oracle of Bacchus. Colombe prepares to assume the part of Sibyl, while Panurge offers to make a sacrifice of a lamb. He rejects the price demanded and tosses the lamb into the sea, after which the shepherd and locals dive in to rescue it.\nThe Sibyl now enters and answers Panurge's enquiries, saying that he will find his wife when he drinks less and stops beating her. Jean, Pantagruel and the followers next arrive by boat. Colombe, having taken off the disguise, joins her husband and calls for wine; the Queen reminds Panurge of his oath. All raise their cups in rejoicing as the curtain falls.\n\nNotes\nSources\n", "id": "7707646", "categories": ["1913 operas", "Operas", "Operas by Jules Massenet", "French-language operas", "Operas set in France", "Operas based on novels"], "title": "Panurge (opera)"}

From his background in jazz and traditional Scandinavian music, he has designed musical instruments from non-traditional materials, including ice.\n\nIsungset was raised in Geilo where he played traditional dance music with his father (accordion) during his high school days. Moving to Bergen in 1984 led him to be a popular member of a number of Bergen groups, such as Ictus and Tordenskjolds soldater (1984–85), Growl and Gruv (1984-88), Saksbehandlerne and Night and Day (1985–86), Salsa Pati (1985–87), and Supply (1985–88), in addition to periods within the Big Band Emanon from 1986, and his recording debut \"Amalgamation\" (1985) with Kenneth Sivertsen.\n\nIsungset is, after more than two decades on the jazz scene, one of Europe's most accomplished and innovative percussionists. With more than 25 years experience in jazz and Scandinavian traditional music he raises these narrow forms of music far beyond their traditional boundaries, becoming more like a crossover between a sound artist and a shaman. When crafting his own instruments from Norwegian natural elements such as arctic birch, granite, slate, sheep bells and even ice, he is highly recommended to those sensible to the poetry and simplicity of sounds.\n\nHis work is highly acclaimed in the press, often described as innovative, visual, energetic, and different from any previously known concepts. His love for ice music was raised in 1999 when the commission of the winterfestival at Lillehammer asked him to compose and play in a frozen waterfall. He has invented the concept of icemusic, and also invented a way to perform icemusic indoor in ordinary concert halls, doing around 50 indoor ice concerts every year. CNN calls Isungset the first and only icemusician in the world.\n\nIsungset has been commissioned to compose music for jazz festivals, dance performances, theatre, and film, with 41 commissioned concerts.\n\nHe has released ten solo albums and is now doing most of his work internationally. Solo concerts, with his band or in collaboration with other artists. In 2006 he had the idea of creating an icemusic festival and started the Ice Music Festival at Geilo, Norway organized by Pål Knutsson Medhus. He is also the founding manager of the record label All Ice Records.\n\nHis most recent project is the Glassmusic together with Arve Henriksen. They released an album named \"World of Glass\" in late 2014. The recordings were largely made in front of a live audience in Tallinn. All the instruments were made from glass by students from the Estonian Academy of Arts.\n\nHe is a member of the bandsGroupa (Sweden), Utla and Isglem. He has ongoing duos with Per Jørgensen, Arve Henriksen, Sissel Vera Pettersen, Didier Petit, Therese Skauge, Jorma Tapio and Stian Westerhus.\n\nFor the 2017 Vossajazz festival, Isungset was commissioned to compose new music for a new band.\n\nIsungset is also an associate professor at the Grieg Academy, University of Bergen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompositions by Terje Isungset:\nFloating Rhythms Molde International Jazzfestival 10 musicians & 2 dancers 1999 \nEin neger på Nes stasjon TV2 - Norway.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7707738", "text": "USS War Hawk\n\nUSS \"War Hawk\" (AP-168) was a \"La Salle\"-class transport ship of the United States Navy, built at the Moore Dry Dock Company in Oakland, California in 1942. The \"La Salle\"-class transport had a displacement of almost 14,000 tons and were designed to ferry troops and supplies to and from the war zone during World War II.\n\n\"War Hawk\" carried eight LCVP (Higgins Boat) type landing craft used to move troops and four LCMs used to move heavy equipment to and from the shore.\n\nHer keel was laid down on 24 December 1942. The hull was completed in a little over three months and was launched on 3 April 1943 under the command of Commander S. H. Thompson. After launch, \"War Hawk\" was fitted out and acquired by the United States Navy on 9 March 1944. She was commissioned on the same day and designated AP-168.\n\nOn 21 April 1944 she left the San Francisco Bay headed for Pearl Harbor, on the island of Oahu. At Pearl Harbor \"War Hawk\" joined the 5th Fleet Amphibious Force and after training, left for her part in \"Operation Forager\", the liberation of the Marianas Islands. At the time of the landing there were about 59,000 Japanese troops stations in the Southern Marianas Islands, in particular on Saipan, Tinian and Guam.\n\nThe assault on Marianas was conducted with overwhelming force. All total there were 198 vessels involved including 110 transports and auxiliary ships and 88 warships. These ships carried and supported a force of 110,000 men. However, Saipan had been in Japanese control for more than ten years and was heavily fortified. There were approximately 31,000 Japanese troops (including navy), and well entrenched on the island.\n\n\"War Hawk\" arrived at Saipan on 15 June 1944 and landed elements of the 2nd Marine Division on the southwestern shore of the island. Sometime during the next eight days \"War Hawk\" helped fight off two Japanese air attacks. During this time she also took on eleven seriously wounded Japanese prisoners of war. As was the nature of many Japanese soldiers, the only way they would be taken prisoner was if they could not fight. The extent of their wounds was so great that all eleven died in spite of efforts of \"War Hawk\"s medical staff. They were buried at sea. Four days after the landing, the Allies engaged the Japanese Navy in the Philippine Sea and inflicted tremendous damage. This battle prevented the Imperial Japanese Navy from resupplying their troops in the Marianas leaving a brutal war of attrition for the Japanese until the commanding officer, General Yoshitsugu Saitō, committed suicide and the island was declared liberated on 9 July 1944.\n\nAs the fighting on Saipan came to a close, some of \"War Hawk\"s sister ships began moving troops from Saipan to Tinian. \"War Hawk\" did not directly participate in the invasion of Tinian. However, several LCVPs en route to Saipan's beachheads, came within range of what were apparently 20 mm explosive shell fire from Tinian which is only a few miles off the coast of Saipan. There were no hits, but lots of spray as the shells hit around the boats.\n\nOn 23 June 1944 \"War Hawk\" headed back to Pearl Harbor where she picked up elements of the United States Army's 77th Infantry and returned to the Marianas. She landed her troops on Guam on 21 July. She loitered in the area for several more days before returning to Pearl Harbor on 29 June. There she spent a month practicing with new troops from the Army's 96th Infantry Division before leaving again for the South Pacific Theater.\n\nEn route, she was diverted from the canceled invasion of Yap to take part in the invasion of the Philippines.\n\nDuring the latter part of 1944 and early 1945, \"War Hawk\" participated in the operations to liberate the Philippines. She left Pearl Harbor carrying elements of the Army's 96th Infantry Division and headed for Yap Island, in the Carolines. En route, she changed heading for Eniwetok as the invasion of Yap was canceled. After leaving Eniwetok, she sailed for Manus. She headed to the Philippines on 14 October 1944 to take part in the invasion of Leyte.\n\nLeyte was heavily defended by 20,000 Japanese troops. The Imperial Japanese Army had decided that it was best to fortify the Philippines to prevent the Allies from moving north through them to the Japanese homeland. In total there were about 432,000 troops on the various Philippine Islands. There were also between 100 and 120 operational Japanese air bases that would be used to provide air attacks during any amphibious invasion.\n\nThe approach to the landing was from the southwest through the Leyte Gulf. The beaches were between the cities of Tacloban and Dulag on the northeast side of the island. In total, the Leyte invasion was the largest invasion mounted in the Pacific to date. There were a combined total of 701 ships of which 157 were warships. The transports put six Army divisions and one battalion of Rangers onto Leyte in just a few days.\n\nIt was during this phase of the war that General Douglas MacArthur waded ashore at Red Beach and issued his famous \"I have returned\" speech to the people of the Philippines. Carl Mydans, a photographer for \"Time–Life\", took the famous photograph of MacArthur wading ashore on Red Beach on 9 January 1945. \"War Hawk\" landed her troops not far away at Green Beach.\n\nIn the evening of 21 October 1944, \"War Hawk\" was maneuvering through Leyte Gulf and rammed the battleship near the stern. \"Tennessee\" was laying dead in the water and generating smoke to protect the ships from air attack. No one was hurt on either ship. The damage to \"Tennessee\" was light but \"War Hawk\" sustained moderate damage near the bow.\n\nOne of the more interesting pieces of cargo that \"War Hawk\" landed at Leyte was a Piper Cub artillery spotting aircraft. It left Pearl Harbor loaded onto the deck of \"War Hawk\" (with its wings removed) and was put ashore by an LCM. Before the aircraft could be assembled, a Japanese mortar round knocked a palm tree over onto it.\n\nAfter the initial invasion of Leyte, \"War Hawk\" sailed back to Dutch New Guinea, where she picked up a field hospital unit and returned to Leyte. \"War Hawk\" returned to New Britain and picked up troops from the Army's 40th Infantry Division and returned to Luzon.\n\nThe next step in the liberation of the Philippines was the invasion of the island of Luzon, the island on which the capitol Manila resides. The invasion of Luzon began in the Lingayen Gulf on the western side of the island on 9 January 1945. In just a few days, \"War Hawk\" and her sister ships had landed almost 175,000 troops, mostly made up of the 6th Army. These troops began a push east, north and south towards Manila.\n\nInitially, beach resistance was light and with a low surf, \"War Hawk\" was able to put her troops and supplies almost directly onto the beach. There was some fire from Japanese gun emplacements. These emplacements were often made of layers of coconut logs which, being very spongy, were very resistant to everything but the large caliber weapons.\n\nAt 04:10 hours on the morning of 10 January 1945, \"War Hawk\" was anchored in Lingayen Gulf where she was attacked in the dark by a \"Shinyo\" suicide boat. These boats were small motorboats laden with up to two tons of explosives in the bow. Lookouts reported hearing an approaching boat when the Shinyo rammed the port side of the ship. The explosion blew a hole in hold number three killing 61 men. (Commander Thompson's official Action Report filed on 18 January 1945 states that 23 people were missing and unaccounted for 20 minutes after the explosion. He does not give details on the wounded.) The damage to the ship was extensive including flooding in the engine room which knocked out power. With the ship dead in the water, the crew struggled to keep her afloat, restore power and fight off continuing Japanese air attacks throughout the day. That same day two Landing Craft Infantry (\"LCI-365\" and \"LCI-974\") were sunk in the same area by Shinyo boats.\n\nBy 11 January, the hole had been buttressed and partial power had been restored and \"War Hawk\" began a long, slow journey back to Leyte Gulf. Two days later, 13 January, the gun crews downed a kamikaze aircraft splattering the bow with flaming debris. Once in Leyte Gulf, further and more permanent repairs were made to the ship enabling her to sail to Manus in the Admiralty Islands for further dry dock work. She set sail for San Francisco Bay on 22 February 1945.\n\n\"War Hawk\" was repaired at an unknown dock facility in San Francisco Bay and set sail for San Diego on 29 May 1945. There she picked up troops from an unspecified division and returned to Guam in the Marianas. She made one more trip back to San Francisco for a load of naval replacements and headed for Eniwetok, Ulithi and Leyte Gulf. While en route, she received word that the United States had dropped two atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese had agreed to an unconditional surrender.\n\n\"War Hawk\" was decommissioned on 12 August 1946 in Seattle, Washington. She became the property of the Maritime Commission on 13 August after sailing to Olympia, Washington, and was eventually struck from the Navy List on 8 October 1946.\n\nThe Waterman Steamship Corporation of Mobile, Alabama, purchased her on 4 February 1948 and operated her until 1964 as a freighter. After her service with Waterman, \"War Hawk\" was sold to the Ocean Transport Company of New York and renamed \"Ocean Dinny\". She operated with under Ocean Clippers, Inc., until 1966 when she was sold again to her last owner of record, the Overseas Carrier Corporation. She was scrapped at Kaohsiung in January 1971.\n\n", "id": "7707738", "categories": ["Ships built in Oakland, California", "La Salle-class transports", "1943 ships"], "title": "USS War Hawk"}

At the , Pingelly had a population of 809.\n\nThe town was originally a railway siding along the Great Southern Railway line, built by the Western Australian Land Company, and opened in 1889. Later the same year the company designed the town and made land available. In 1896 the state government purchased the railway and the land and gazetted the townsite in 1898. Its name is Aboriginal in origin and is the name of the \"Pingeculling Rocks\" found to the north of the town. The name was first recorded in 1873, and the original settlers referred to the area as \"Pingegulley\" for years before the town was gazetted.\n\nIn early 1898 the population of the town was 89, 52 males and 37 females.\n\nTenders for the construction of the local Agricultural Hall were advertised in late 1893, the contract was awarded to Thorne, Bower and Stewart in early 1894. The Hall was opened in September of the same year with a tamar hunt and a ball to mark the occasion.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1941 three motor racing events were held annually in the town, using a circuit which went in a clockwise direction.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7707787", "text": "Carmen (2003 film)\n\nCarmen is a 2003 Spanish drama film directed by Vicente Aranda. The script was written by Aranda and Joaquim Jordà adapting the classic romance of the same name by Prosper Mérimée. Director Vicente Aranda based the plot on Mérimée's original 1847 novella about jealousy and passion, not its famous operatic adaptation by Bizet from 1875, changing some details about the love story between Carmen (Paz Vega) and José (Leonardo Sbaraglia). As in the novella, author Mérimée (Jay Benedict) is portrayed as a French writer who finds the \"real\" Carmen in early 19th century Spain.\n\nWhile traveling through Andalusia, Spain in 1830, Prosper Mérimée, a French writer, meets José, a wanted criminal. José ends up condemned to death by garroting. The day before José is going to be executed, Mérimée, who has befriended the bandit, visits him in prison. From his jail cell, José begins to narrate his tragic story to the sympathetic writer.\n\nJosé Lizarrabengoa, a serious and proper Basque sergeant in the Spanish army, is stationed in Córdoba. Next to his military headquarters there is a cigar factory where Carmen, a sultry young woman, works. Half gipsy half witch, Carmen is beautiful, flirtatious and has a tempestuous temper. During an argument instigated by Fernanda, a fellow factory worker who has called her gipsy, Carmen retaliates against her rival by slashing Fernanda’s face with a knife. Carmen is arrested and José is left in charge of her custody. On the way to prison, Carmen flirts with José and he consents to allow her to escape - his payback is the promise for a night of passion with her. José's breach of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while. Carmen keeps her pact, providing José with his first sexual encounter. He is dazzled with the sexual delight to which she introduces him and he can't keep her out of his mind. José encounters Carmen again while he is in Seville guarding the entrance to the city. Carmen seduces him once more. José turns a blind eye to Carmen's smuggler friends, allowing them to pass his post and, as a reward, she pays him with sex.\n\nWithout her work at the factory, Carmen is now not only part of a ring of smugglers but supplements her income by prostitution. Blanca, the experienced madame who runs the house Carmen uses for her sexual encounters, warns José against Carmen. Carmen has a shady past and a devilish nature, but it is too late for José. He is already deeply in love. That same night, José waits in vain for Carmen in the brothel. She appears late, arriving in the company of his lieutenant. Furious, José challenges his superior to a sword fight and kills the man.\n\nNow a criminal, with his career and place in society lost, José follows Carmen's advise and flees to the countryside, joining some of Carmen's bandit friends: Dancaire, Aristóteles, Señorito, and Juanele. José adapts quickly to his new life. He becomes one of the bandits, feared as \"José the Basque\". Soon, Carmen comes to join them in the hideout in the hills. Even in front of the other bandits, Carmen and José restart their passionate affair. Their idyll is broken by the sudden arrival of Carmen's gangster husband, El Tuerto, who has just been released from prison. José is initially extremely jealous but, fearing the consequences of clashing with the dangerous Tuerto, he has no other choice but to accept the circumstances. Carmen assures José that he is the one she loves. Without a choice of her own, she had been sold to El Tuerto when she was fourteen. Carmen makes an effort to make love to José as often as she does to her husband. The other bandits, in order to keep the peace in the group, keep quiet.\n\nJosé continues to work with the bandit group, which is reduced in clashes with the authorities. Eventually José snaps and, with Carmen's aid, murders El Tuerto in a knife fight. Yet more trouble comes between them when the flirtatious Carmen catches the eye of Lucas, a dashing matador. Jose's paranoia and desire to possess Carmen entirely soon overwhelm him. When he discovers Carmen in bed with Lucas, José kills the bullfighter and runs away from the dead man's hacienda. Locked in an empty church with Carmen, José confronts her. Carmen does not love him any more and she is defiant. She dares him to kill her. Crying while they kiss, José murders Carmen with his knife.\n\n\nWhile the quality of technical realization and costumes was acknowledged, viewers criticized the actors' performances, the lack of chemistry between the two main characters, and problems of the plot. The film is rated in several countries for scenes including nudity.\n\nThe film was voted the \"People's Favourite Film\" at the 2004 Birmingham Screen Festival.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in the United States in 2008.\n\n", "id": "7707787", "categories": ["Spanish films", "2000s romantic drama films", "Films about writers", "Spanish historical films", "2000s historical films", "Films set in the 19th century", "Spanish drama films", "Films based on romance novels", "Spanish-language films", "Films based on Carmen", "Films directed by Vicente Aranda"], "title": "Carmen (2003 film)"}

The show has agriculture at its core, but it has expanded with the addition of rides, competitions and educational facilities. It is said that this is where \"city meets country\" and \"country meets city\".\n\nThe Royal Canberra Show can trace its origins back to the first events organised by the Ginninderra Farmers' Union, which was formed in 1905. At first, it ran sporting events at Ginninderra, including ploughing matches, but in 1909 it held its first annual agricultural show. These shows were discontinued because of the First World War, despite the 1915 event being attended by 1,200 people and raising much-needed funds for the war effort. One of the driving forces, from the days of the Ginninderra Farmers' Union until 1944, was the Ginninderra blacksmith, Harry Curran, father of Babe Curran of Deasland, the district's preeminent wool grower. The Advance Hall and District Association organised a small district show in 1924 and 1925. The show of 1927 is officially recognised by the Royal National Capital Agricultural Society as the \"inaugural\" Canberra Show. The show continued to grow: the first two-day show was held in 1931, and the 1932 show was opened by Prime Minister J.A. Lyons. After a hiatus in the Second World War, the show resumed with the support of leading sheep breeder Sir Walter Merriman. In 1964 the show moved to its permanent home at the Canberra Showground. The Show was given \"Royal\" status in 1979.\n\nThe number of people who enter their livestock and other agricultural goods into the various competitions has increased, reflecting the significant role the Show plays in the development of the skills and excellence of those who live in the surrounding region, according to the Royal Canberra Show website. \n\nIn 2012, the show marked the International Year of the Farmer.\n\n", "id": "7707789", "categories": ["Festivals established in 1927", "Recurring events established in 1927", "Royal shows in Australia", "Annual events in Australia", "1927 establishments in Australia", "Events in Canberra"], "title": "Royal Canberra Show"}

He was elected to the House of Commons in a November 27, 2006 by-election following the death of Benoît Sauvageau.\n\nAs a young man Gravel worked in bars in Montreal's Gay Village; he has been open about the fact that he was a sex-trade worker during that time. He entered the seminary in 1982 and became a priest. Gravel is controversial among the Catholic clergy and laity for his support of abortion rights, euthanasia and same-sex marriage, three issues officially opposed by the Church. He was most recently a priest at St-Joachim de la Plaine Church in La Plaine, Quebec.\n\nHe was acclaimed as the Bloc's candidate on October 29, 2006. He received a dispensation from Gilles Lussier, Bishop of Joliette, to enter politics. Elected with a large majority in the Bloc stronghold, he became the Bloc critic for seniors' issues.\n\nHowever, following his opposition to Bill C-484, which would have recognized injury of a fetus during a crime as a separate offence from an injury to the mother, and his support for Dr. Henry Morgentaler receiving the Order of Canada, Gravel was ordered by the Vatican to either give up the priesthood or leave politics, and he finally announced he would not run in the 2008 election, saying that the priesthood was his life. He cited as his biggest regret his inability to pass his private member's bill C-490, which aimed to improve seniors' access to guaranteed income supplements.\n\nHe was removed from a position as a catechist in the Quebec Diocese of Joliette during 2010. Gravel then launched a lawsuit against the LifeSiteNews (LSN) agency, a project of the Campaign Life Coalition, for $500,000 in damages. In his motion, Gravel suggests that articles on the LSN website caused him to lose this responsibility. Gravel stated that LSN misrepresented him by identifying him as 'pro-abortion' while he identified himself as 'pro-choice'. In the past he had made some conflicting statements on abortion: in an interview with Radio-Canada, he stated: \"I am pro-choice and there is not a bishop on Earth that will prevent me from receiving communion, not even the Pope\" and later he changed his stance stating: \"I am against abortion, but I am not in favour of the pro-life campaign that condemns all women who get an abortion.\"\n\nIn 2014, he died of lung cancer.

He is also a consultant for the Patients Rights Council. Smith is known for his criticism of assisted suicide and utilitarian bioethics.\n\nSmith has authored or co-authored fourteen books. He formerly collaborated with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and has been published in regional and national outlets such as \"The New York Times\", \"Newsweek\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"USA Today\", the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", \"The Seattle Times\", the \"New York Post\", and others. He is also well known for his blog, \"Human Exceptionalism\", hosted by \"National Review\", which advances his theory of \"human exceptionalism\" and defends intrinsic human dignity. He is a critic of those he labels \"mainstream\" bioethicists such as Peter Singer, Julian Savulescu, Jacob M. Appel, and R. Alta Charo. He has also been highly critical of science writer Matt Ridley.\n\nSmith practiced law in the San Fernando Valley from 1976–1985, at which time he left law practice to pursue other interests, particularly as a public policy advocate. His first book in 1987 was \"The Lawyer Book: A Nuts and Bolts Guide to Client Survival\", introduced by consumer advocate Ralph Nader beginning a collaboration between the two men. Smith is a prolific author and a frequent contributor to \"National Review\" and \"The Weekly Standard\". He closely followed the Terri Schiavo case in 2005, and wrote frequently on the topic.\n\nHe opposes policies allowing for assisted suicide, euthanasia, human cloning, and granting human style \"rights\" to animals,\" making a clear distinction between animal rights and animal welfare. He is also a noted critic of mainstream views in bioethics, human cloning research, radical environmentalism and of what he calls the radical animal liberation movement, which he worries exhibits \"anti-humanism\". His book \"Culture of Death: The Assault on Medical Ethics in America\" was named Best Health Book of the Year at the 2001 Independent Publishers Book Awards.\n\nSmith is one of the world's foremost apologists of \"human exceptionalism,\" which he defends from a secular perspective.\n\nSmith is a frequent guest on radio and television talk shows, having appeared on national programs such as \"Good Morning America\" and \"Nightline\", as well as internationally on BBC Radio 4.

Saunders.\n\nIn a 2001 essay, physician Matthew K. Wynia and attorney Arthur Derse accused Smith of selectively using evidence to create a false impression that bioethics is a monolithic field. They argued that Smith was \"prepared to bend the truth to make a point, turn a stomach, and potentially radicalize a reader.\" Smith rebutted these criticisms, stating in part, \"Wynia and Derse assert that I claim bioethics is a monolith. That is not what I write. What I do believe is that bioethics has, generally, crystallized into an orthodoxy, perhaps even an ideology.

The , right-hander was signed by the Cleveland Indians as an amateur free agent before the 1952 season. He played for the Kansas City Athletics (1962), Los Angeles Angels (1962–1964), Milwaukee Braves (1965), Boston Red Sox (1966–1967), Chicago White Sox (1969), and Houston Astros (1970).\n\nOsinski made his major league debut in relief on April 11, 1962 against the Minnesota Twins at Kansas City Municipal Stadium. He pitched the top of the 9th inning and gave up three earned runs in the 8–0 Athletics loss. He struck out one batter, second baseman Bernie Allen. He pitched in three more games that month, continued to be ineffective, and was sent down to the minor leagues. Then, on July 21, the A's traded him to the Los Angeles Angels. This turned out to be a big break for Osinski.\n\nHe pitched very well out of the Angel bullpen for the rest of the season, along with Bob Botz, Dean Chance, Art Fowler, Tom Morgan, and Jack Spring. Osinski earned his first big league save three days after the trade with two scoreless innings in game 2 of a home doubleheader against Baltimore. Then, just nine days later, he got his first win with a scoreless inning against the Indians in Cleveland.\n\nIn 33 games for the Angels in his rookie year Osinski was 6–4 with 4 saves and an ERA of 2.82. When his Kansas City statistics are added, his final ERA was 3.97.\nDuring his career he started 21 games but usually appeared in relief. The best of his starts was a three-hit, 1–0 shutout over the Chicago White Sox on June 4, 1963 at Chavez Ravine.\n\nFrom 1963 to 1969 his ERA ranged from 2.54 to 3.61. In 1967 he was part of the Red Sox \"Impossible Dream\" team. He had a 3–1 record with two saves for Boston and appeared in two World Series games against the St. Louis Cardinals. Released by Boston during spring training in 1968, the Chicago native saw service that year with Hawaii in the Pacific Coast League, and pitched his way back to the majors in 1969 with the hometown White Sox, compiling a 5–5 record. He was sold to the Houston Astros during the off-season,where he ended his major league career with three appearances in 1970. After the season, he was placed on the roster of the Houston AAA club at Oklahoma City and was claimed by the San Diego Padres, but retired. \n\nHis major league career totals include a 29–28 record in 324 games pitched, 21 games started, 5 complete games, 2 shutouts, 122 games finished, 18 saves, and an ERA of 3.34. He had 400 strikeouts in 589.2 innings pitched for a 6.11 K/9IP, slightly higher than the major league average during his era. He made no errors in his last five seasons (193 games).\n\n", "id": "7707898", "categories": ["Los Angeles Angels players", "Houston Astros players", "1933 births", "Keokuk Kernels players", "Hawaii Islanders players", "Portland Beavers players", "Fort Smith Indians players", "Baseball players from Illinois", "2013 deaths", "Fayetteville Highlanders players", "Sherbrooke Indians players", "Albuquerque Dukes players", "Oklahoma City 89ers players", "Chicago White Sox players", "Milwaukee Braves players", "Tulsa Oilers (baseball) players", "Lincoln Chiefs players", "Reading Indians players", "Kansas City Athletics players", "Spartanburg Peaches players", "Charleston White Sox players", "Boston Red Sox players", "Major League Baseball pitchers"], "title": "Dan Osinski"}

Some regard 1910 itself as the beginning, when August Strindberg published several critical newspaper articles, contesting many conservative values. Several other years are also possible. What is undisputed is that with the advent of social democracy and large labor strikes, the winds of the 1910s blew in the direction of a working class reformation\n\nAfter World War I (1914-1919), literature was marked by despair, depicted in works of Pär Lagerkvist, Hjalmar Bergman and Birger Sjöberg. Literature moved in the direction of proletariat writings during the interwar years, and the remainders of folklore had been reduced to virtual insignificance.\n\nProletarian writing had its strongest period in 1920-1940. Artur Lundkvist and the literary group \"Fem unga\" played a key role in introducing literary modernism with an anthology published in 1929.\nNotable proletarian writers were Moa Martinson (1890-1964), who wrote about the difficulties women had in factory and farm work; and her husband, Harry Martinson (1904-1978), who wrote about the fragility of human beings. But the most distinguished proletarian writer of the time was Ivar Lo-Johansson (1901-1990), writing about the Swedish land-workers in novels, short stories and journalism, and also engaging in public debates about many other topics.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the political developments in Germany had their effects on Swedish literature. Taking a stand against National Socialism, Pär Lagerkvist wrote the novels \"Bödeln\" (1933) and \"Dvärgen\" (The Dwarf) (1944), both investigating human evil. A stand again National Socialism was also made by Karin Boye in the novel \"Kallocain\" (1940) set in a future totalitarian world; the novel has since been translated into ten languages. During the war, Eyvind Johnson also took a recognized stand with his \"The Krilon Group\" series (1941-1943), a massive work speaking strongly in favour of democratic values, condemning dictatorship and worship of power.\n\n", "id": "7707909", "categories": ["Swedish literature"], "title": "Modernist Swedish literature"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7707921", "text": "Leonard Orban\n\nLeonard Orban (born 28 June 1961) is a Romanian independent technocrat who served as the Commissioner for Multilingualism in the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union (EU). He was responsible for the EU language policy and was the first Romanian Commissioner and the first member of the Commission whose portfolio is exclusively multilingualism. His term of office began on 1 January 2007 and ended on 9 February 2010. With a background in engineering and economics, Orban has taken up various posts working for the accession of Romania to the European Union, most prominently as Deputy and later as Chief Negotiator for his country at the time of final negotiations with the European Union.\n\nSteering the multilingualism language policy of the EU, Orban focused on promoting foreign language learning through EU programmes such as the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013. In addition, his remit also included the effective functioning of the EU's extensive interpretation, translation and publication services in the 23 official languages. To support the remit of his portfolio, Orban oversaw a staff of 3,400 in total (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent of the EU budget.\n\nThough unaffiliated to any political party, Orban adheres to liberalism. He supports Romania's closer European integration and a strong European Union, and were in favour of the relaunch of the frozen Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe without modifications to the original text.\n\nAs of 20 September 2011, he is the Romanian Minister of European Affairs, a new ministry in the Emil Boc Cabinet.\n\nOrban was born in Braşov, central Romania, to a Hungarian father and a Romanian mother. His brother, Ludovic Orban, a prominent politician of Romania's National Liberal Party, was Romania's Transport Minister. He is married and has a daughter, and his personal interests range across foreign policy, classical music, reading and cinema.\n\nOrban gained a bachelor's degree (1981–1986) in engineering at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Transylvania University of Braşov, and a bachelor's degree (1987–1992) in economics at the Faculty of Management, Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies. Alongside Romanian, he is also fluent in English and French and has passive knowledge of Italian.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1993, he worked as engineer for Tractor Manufacturing Company Miercurea Ciuc (1986–1989, Romanian: \"Întreprinderea de Tractoare Miercurea Ciuc\"), Enterprise for Special Industrial Constructions Bucharest (1989–1990, Romanian: \"Întreprinderea de Antrepriza Construcţii Speciale Industriale şi Montaj (I.A.C.S.I.M.) Bucureşti\") and Institute of Research for Machine Manufacturing Technology Bucharest (1990–1993, Romanian: \"Institutul de Cercetare Tehnologia Construcţiilor de Maşini (I.C.T.C.M.) Bucureşti\").\n\nFrom 1993 to 2001, Orban served as a Parliamentary Counsellor on European and International Affairs within the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament, where he was responsible for the European Integration Committee, as well as relations with the European Parliament. In 1995, the Association Agreement between the EU and Romania came into force and Orban also dealt with the Secretariat of the Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Romania. Between May 2001 and December 2004, he served as Deputy Chief Negotiator and from December 2004 to December 2006, as Chief Negotiator with the EU and as Secretary of State of the Ministry of European Integration of Romania, directly responsible for coordinating Romania's preparation for accession to the EU, as well as drafting the Treaty of Accession. On 25 April 2005, together with the Romanian president Traian Băsescu, the Romanian prime minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu and the Romanian foreign minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu, Orban was one of the signatories for Romania on the country's Treaty of Accession in Luxembourg. After the signing of the Treaty, when Romania received the status of the observer in the Council of the European Union and in the Commission's committees, Orban was responsible for coordinating Romania's policies and positions in EU affairs. On 30 October 2006, Orban was nominated as Romania's candidate for the European Commission. From 1 January 2007, Orban became European Commissioner for Multilingualism for Romania in the Barroso commission. He wrote numerous newspaper articles and analyses and gave several speeches on European affairs.\n\nOrban has not joined a political party, but is of liberal political leaning. He participated as an independent in the European Parliament political group Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE).\n\nAs European Commissioner for Multilingualism in the Barroso Commission, Orban was responsible for the language policy of the European Union, i.e. promoting multilingualism for the citizens and the institutions of the European Union. He was the first to hold this portfolio. Multilingualism has previously and subsequently been a responsibility of the European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism, Ján Figeľ, the first Commissioner whose portfolio explicitly included multilingualism.\n\nPolitically, the portfolio is focused on promoting foreign languages learning, specifically, an individual's mother tongue plus two other languages, as means for the worker’s mobility and business competitiveness.\n\nThough awareness for linguistic diversity is a policy target, the language rights of speakers of regional, minority, lesser-used and migrant languages are not legally protected. In the European Union, language policy is the responsibility of member states and European Union does not have a \"common language policy.\" Based on the \"principle of subsidiarity\", European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in their language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of their languages. The content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states and the European Union has very limited influence in this area. However, a number of European Union funded programmes actively promote language learning, most prominently under the much wider Lifelong learning Programme 2007–2013. Though regional and minority languages can benefit from European Union programmes, protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the member states.\n\nOrban was also responsible for the effective functioning of the European Union's extensive interpretation, translation and publication services in the 23 official languages of the Union. Language policy affects the overall European Union strategy of communication with its citizens and the effort to establish a European identity. In many of these issues, responsibility was shared with other Commissioners, namely the European Commissioner for Education, Training and Culture, Ján Figeľ. Orban was also responsible, alongside the President of the Commission, Barroso, and Figeľ to work on \"intercultural dialogue\", including the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.\n\nAdministratively, Orban was in charge of the Directorate-General (DG) for Translation, the DG for Interpretation and the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, as well as the Multilingualism policy unit (EAC-C-5) in the DG for Education and Culture. In total, Orban is responsible for overseeing 3,400 staff (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent of the EU budget.\n\nOrban was assisted by a cabinet of nine members; Patricia Bugnot (French) was Head of Cabinet and Jochen Richter (German) was Deputy Head. The cabinet did not include any natively anglophone member. Orban's salary was €18,233.38 (approx. US$23,631, c.2007) a month plus housing allowance.\n\nAccording to Article 45 of the protocol to the Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania, the new members of the Commission representing the acceding member states were appointed by the Council of the European Union in common accord with the President of the Commission and after consultation with the European Parliament. Compared to former enlargements of the European Union, the Accession Treaty for Bulgaria and Romania, for the first time, contains an explicit acknowledgement of the Parliament’s role and constitutes the formal legal basis for the new Commissioners’ appointment procedure.\n\nOn 30 October 2006, in agreement with the President of the Commission, Barroso, the Romanian government nominated Leonard Orban as Commissioner designate for Romania. Barroso assigned him the portfolio of multilingualism. Before Orban, Varujan Vosganian, a former Romanian National Liberal Party Minister of Economy and Commerce, had been nominated, but withdrew his candidature due to allegations concerning his past involvement with the secret police under Ceauşescu and party financing by a tycoon. National Liberal Party foreign minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu refused a nomination.\n\nThe assignment of the multilingualism portfolio to the Romanian Commissioner by Barroso was highly controversial. Barroso was severely criticized for creating a new Commissioner portfolio so that the accessing countries in 2007 could hold a post. The portfolio was criticized for being too \"light\" for such a high-rank official, that there would be an overlap of responsibilities with other Commissioners and the good functioning of the Commission would be endangered. The portfolio was considered insubstantial for a Commissioner due to the limited jurisdiction of the EU in affecting language policy and the more administrative (rather than political character) of the post. In addition, it appeared that the portfolio had been created to complete a 27-strong Commission; Romania's appointment of a technocrat rather than a politician, given the country's deficits in interior and justice policies, especially in terms of corruption, would result in the Romanian Commissioner taking a degraded portfolio. This criticism came from the Social Democratic Party (PSD), Romania's main opposition party, the Socialist Group (PES) in the European Parliament and the liberal \"Financial Times\" newspaper. Socialist Group leader, Martin Schulz, suggested a portfolio for the protection of ethnic minorities instead. The Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament asked Barroso to clarify the mandate of the Commissioner for Multilingualism as well as the mandate of the other members of the Commission with regards to the \"intercultural dialogue\". Barroso turned down the PES proposal and defended the post. He stated that Ján Figeľ, the Commissioner for Education, Training and Culture, \"will remain responsible for the management of actions to directly promote the inter-cultural dialogue\".\n\nAfter a public hearing in Brussels at the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) of the European Parliament in participation with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) on27 November 2006, the Committee gave a positive assessment. On December 12, 2006, Orban received the formal approval of the European Parliament in Strasbourg with 595 votes in favour, 16 against and 29 abstentions. The Socialist Group voted for Orban, laying the blame for the portfolio's mandate on the President of the Commission rather than the Commissioner designate. On 1 January 2007 he was appointed by the Council and on 22 January 2007, in a ceremony in Luxembourg, Orban was sworn in before the European Court of Justice.\n\nOrban held the position of European Commissioner until 31 October 2009, when the remaining term of office for the Barroso Commission ends.\n\nIn his hearing at the European Parliament, Leonard Orban focused on defending the importance of his post in presenting the EU language policy, emphasising foreign language learning and describing the concrete initiatives he intended to implement.\n\nOrban said that he intended to spearhead the Commission's work on a portfolio that has become more important with every enlargement and assured the Members of the European Parliament that his portfolio was a substantial one, covering a range of important political and managerial responsibilities. He also described how his portfolio would contribute to economic competitiveness, the social dimension of the EU and the intercultural dialogue and stated that it would provide a forum for European political dialogue.\n\nOrban told the Committee that the multilingual dimension of the EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes and should not be seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, \"Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the internal market: culture, education and competitiveness.\" In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, \"At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [... but] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism.\" According to Orban, multilingualism promotes labour mobility, tolerance and a sense of European citizenship and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy. Within the Lisbon strategy, the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient. To address this, Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language-friendly. He underlined that, \"our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Turkish and Russian.\" He added that, \"The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union as well as to the languages of the EU's main trading partners.\" Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, \"Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted,\" which presumably includes all languages, national, regional, minority and migrant. However, Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, \"When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States.\"\n\nOrban's remit included the development of the European Indicator of Language Competence, the creation of a Business Forum on Multilingualism and \"Juvenes Translatores\", a translation contest between schools from all over Europe as part of the events marking the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. In addition to the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 and other educational and cultural programmes, Orban promoted multilingualism within other relevant policies and programmes, including the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the European Social Fund and immigration initiatives. He also intended to contribute to the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, where multilingualism played a fundamental part. On planning further policy, Orban promised to, \"carefully analyse the results from the Action Plan for the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity, the recommendations from the High Level Group on Multilingualism and the activities of the Commission internal network for multilingualism. Before the end of 2007, I would organise a Ministerial conference to discuss the way forward. I would then propose a new Action Plan in 2008 to continue work in this area.\"\n\nHis views on multilingualism fall in line with the current European Union language policy as described in the Communication from the Commission \"A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism\" on 22 November 2005.\n\nOrban defended Romania's accession to the EU, believing that Romania can only gain from its entry and stressing the importance of a post-accession strategy for his country.\n\nOn the \"future of Europe\", Orban believes in a strong, cohesive European Union capable of being a major actor on the global scene. In addition, he stressed the need to increase the pace of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, a ten-year strategy designed to make the European Union the world's most competitive economy by 2010. Institutionally, he supported the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, voted down in referendums in France and Netherlands in 2005, believing that it should be ratified by the member states without further negotiations or without excluding some of its provisions.\n\n", "id": "7707921", "categories": ["1961 births", "Living people", "People from Brașov", "Romanian civil servants", "Romanian European Commissioners", "Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies alumni", "Language policy of the European Union", "Romanian politicians of Hungarian descent"], "title": "Leonard Orban"}

For these actions, he was hanged by the British authorities. Born in Paris, he also had a Swiss heritage and was a Calvinist.\n\nHindelang took part in the French Revolution of 1830 (the July Revolution), in which he became an officer. He declared that he came to the Americas to do commerce at the demand of his parents. This was however contradicted by P. H. Touvrey, a compatriot of Hindelang present during the Rebellion, who said that Hindelang specifically came to join the Lower Canada Rebellion. Recruited by Ludger Duvernay in the United States, he arrived in Lower Canada on November 4, 1838. During the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1838, he fought the Battle of Odelltown on Patriote ranks, the last battle of the conflict. The Patriotes were defeated.\n\nHindelang was apprehended shortly after as he attempted to flee back to the United States, and was sentenced to death. He was hanged on February 15, 1839 at the Pied-du-Courant Prison in Montreal with such people as François-Marie-Thomas Chevalier de Lorimier. In front of the crowd, before the execution, he shouted: \"The cause for which I am sacrificed is noble and great [...] Canadiens, my last goodbye is the old cry of France: Long live freedom! (\"Vive la liberté!\")\" His character plays a notable role in Pierre Falardeau's film \"February 15, 1839\" about the incarceration and execution of the Patriotes.\n\n", "id": "7708062", "categories": ["1810 births", "People from Paris", "French Calvinist and Reformed Christians", "Executed Canadian people", "People executed by British North America by hanging", "1839 deaths", "People executed by Lower Canada", "French soldiers", "19th-century executions by the United Kingdom", "Executed French people", "Executed revolutionaries", "Quebec revolutionaries", "Executed people from Île-de-France", "Lower Canada Rebellion people"], "title": "Charles Hindelang"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7708075", "text": "Nigori\n\nNigori or is a variety of sake, an alcoholic beverage produced from rice. Its name translates roughly to \"cloudy\" because of its appearance. It is about 12–17% alcohol by volume, averaging 15% with some as high as 20%. \n\nSake is usually filtered to remove grain solids left behind after the fermentation process. Nigori sake is filtered using a broader mesh, resulting in the permeating of fine rice particles and a far cloudier drink. Unfiltered sake is known as doburoku (どぶろく, but also 濁酒) and was originally brewed across Japan by farming families. However, it was banned in the Meiji period, though it has since been revived as a local brewing tradition. The area around Mihara village in southern Shikoku is especially well-known for its doburoku breweries.\n\nBrewer Tokubee Masuda, of Kyoto-based Tsukino Katsura brewery, which began in 1675, looked to bring back hundred-year-old recipes and traditional production methods available to modernize their products. Beginning in 1964 (or 1966), Masuda began lobbying the Japanese government to relax sake production-laws in order to produce an unfiltered sake that would be cloudy and offer a visual component, similar to European wines. The result was a sake that was cloudy, effervescent, unpasteurized, and slightly sweeter. Author John Gauntner, discussing the production process that allowed nigori to be considered as sake, notes:\"What they did was create a cage-like device, an insert with holes in its walls that fit into a tank of sake. The sake that leaked through the  holes in the center of the insert was then drawn off and bottled. The government determined that as long as the holes in the mesh were no larger than 2 millimeters in diameter, the result of filtration using the cage could legally be considered sake. Hence, nigori was born as a genre of sake. Other breweries later followed suit, using their own contraptions.\"Gauntner also remarked that currently, most brewers no longer bother filtering out the sake, but will instead dilute the final product with filtered sake. Formerly, only water could be added to sake after fermenting, but current laws state that only water \"and\" sake can be added afterward.\n\nIn 2010, a brewer from Akita Prefecture came up with a dark version of nigori sake, the color of which is due to the addition of edible finely powdered charcoal.\n\nNigori sake is generally the sweetest of all sake, with a fruity nose and a mild flavor, making a great drink to complement spicy foods or as a dessert wine. Before serving, the bottle is shaken properly to mix the sediment with the sake, to obtain the full range of flavor and its signature look. It is advised that it be served well-chilled, storing it in an ice bucket to keep it from warming up between servings. It is recommended, as with most sake, to consume the entire bottle once opened before it begins to oxidize, altering its flavor.\n\nNigori sake is more popular in the United States than in Japan, as are other less traditional varieties, which has led to an increase of American sake brewers. \n\n\n", "id": "7708075", "categories": ["Sake"], "title": "Nigori"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7708134", "text": "Swedish children's literature\n\nThe Swedish children's literature tradition was initiated by the Swedish-speaking Finn Zacharius Topelius in the 19th century. It flourished at the dawn of the 20th century with Elsa Beskow (1874–1953), who wrote and illustrated some 40 children's stories between 1897–1952. Her books were beloved and have continued to be reprinted in Sweden and many other languages.\n\nIn the 1930s a new awareness of children's need emerged. It was realized that children did not only warrant disciplinary and moralizing literature, but also childlike books to foster their imagination. This manifested itself shortly after World War II, when Astrid Lindgren published Pippi Longstocking in 1945. Pippi's rebellious behaviour at first sparked resistance among some defenders of cultural values, but eventually she was accepted, and with that children's literature was freed from the obligation to promote moralism.\nAstrid Lindgren continued to publish many best-selling children's books which eventually made her the most read Swedish author of all categories with over 100 million copies printed throughout the world, translated into over 80 languages. Lindgren showed in many other books her fine comprehension of childlike thought and values; in The Brothers Lionheart about death, as well as a tale of bravery; in \"Mio, My Son\" a fairy tale about friendship.\n\nBut not all her stories had deep messages, at least on the surface. Three books on Karlsson-on-the-Roof (1955, '62, '68) are about a short, chubby and mischievous man with a propeller on his back, who is befriended by a boy. The stories of Karlsson-on-the-Roof became one of the most loved children's stories in Russia during the Soviet era. And in twelve books Astrid wrote about Emil of Maple Hills, a boy on the Småland countryside in the early 1900s, who continuously gets intro trouble because of his pranks. She also wrote many other appreciated books; most of them were filmed, some with good results that have led to them being continuously rerun on Swedish television.\n\nOne of the few fantasy writers in Swedish literature was Tove Jansson (1914–2001), who wrote her stories of the Moomins in nine books and four picture books between 1946 and 1993. Jansson was from Finland's Swedish-speaking minority, and wrote in Swedish. The Moomins are trolls that live in an economically and politically independent state, without any material necessities. Perhaps this explains the vast popularity the Moomins have enjoyed in many different countries. The Moomin books have been translated into over 30 languages.\n\nMore recently, other children's authors have become notable, such as Maria Gripe, Gunnel Linde, Inger and Lasse Sandberg, Sven Nordqvist with the Pettson and Findus series, Moni Brännström, Anders Jacobsson and Sören Olsson.\n", "id": "7708134", "categories": [], "title": "Swedish children's literature"}

Previously it has referred to objects of different nature (e.g. images, user interfaces, models, prototypes, computer animation, virtual books) that exist in digital environments. The concept behind the term is rapidly developing and expanding as new phenomena emerge in the virtual domain.\n\nImaginary worlds, characters, items, etc. have been described in stories and tales since the dawn of humanity. In the philosophic discourse, utopias have existed where extensive systems and their components have been depicted in detail. Imaginary artifacts have been described and created in terms of language and visual presentation. The development of the visual presentation techniques (e.g. linear perspective, cinematography) enabled more sophisticated methods to describe these artifacts, events and entities in painting, photography and film. Moreover, virtual artifacts were (and still are) commonly found in environments that require a strong imaginary aspect in order to be experienced, such as radio shows, novels, tabletop role-playing games, etc.\n\nThe development of computing enabled the creation of interactive virtual environments that were based on digital technologies and new methods of presentation. In digital environments, virtual artifacts became independent entities that could exist and interact outside the human mind. Even previously unknown, complex forms and imaginary artifacts (e.g. fractals) could be created and represented in these environments.\n\nHumans have expanded the existing environment to the virtual domain. Virtual artifacts can be seen as an essential cultural phenomenon in modern society. Virtual artifacts bear meanings and functions and since they are part of the world they affect real world events and people's lives.\n\nVirtual artifacts have certain similarities to real-life artifacts even though they do not have physical properties in the traditional sense. However, real-life objects and environments can be simulated in digital environments (like computer games, 3D modeling or virtual reality). Simulated virtual objects (photorealistic VA) and environments have a model in the real world; however, depending on the context, an abstract virtual artifact isn't necessarily dependent on the laws of physics or causality.\n\nSome virtual artifacts are purely abstract in their nature, therefore they can't model real-life objects or phenomena. For example, computer programs or digital user interfaces, while often containing representative components of real-life objects, can't exist in physical terms. These virtual artifacts do not have to be comprehensible to humans at all; they can be created and understood solely by artificial intelligence.\n\nVirtual artifacts can have physical properties (for example color, length) depending on the environment they exist in. These physical properties can be presented and perceived using a certain medium such as a computer screen. On the other hand, virtual artifacts can also contain properties that aren't perceptible. Due to their immaterial nature they can be flexibly accessed, reproduced and archived—even simultaneously by multiple users.\n\n\nVirtual artifacts can have a virtual and/or \"real\" exchange value, and thus can be considered as products. A person or other juristically defined actor can claim ownership and invest money in virtual artifacts. Virtual artifacts can also be valuable in an economical sense outside the environment (e.g. a virtual world such as ones found in massively multiplayer online games) they are created in. For example, game items and characters are valued in terms of real currencies.\n\nWithin many virtual worlds, there exists a virtual economy that often mimics real-life commercial features and models such as trading with in-game virtual artifacts, virtual currencies, supply and demand, etc.\n\nThere is a viable real-life business model based on the exchange of virtual artifacts within a virtual environment. One example is the social networking game Habbo Hotel; in Habbo-world, users buy virtual products such as furniture for their virtual hotel room with real money. Many online games require a paid subscription for providing access to the game world, creating revenue to the creator of the world.\n\nMoreover, virtual game environments have also created commercial models around them. In fact, the market for virtual artifacts such as game items or virtual property is booming. In China, for example, people are hired to play online games to develop game characters and collect game resources. Furthermore, virtual environments have enabled the production and commercialization of virtual artifacts created by end-users—creating new markets and effectively blurring the line between \"real\" and virtual consumerism.\n\n", "id": "7708188", "categories": [], "title": "Virtual artifact"}

The Luttenbachers have created a body of work focused on musical extremity and dissonance. Over the course of the band, the personnel has shifted numerous times around the artistic leadership of Walter. The music has run a gamut from intense, all-acoustic free improvisation, to complex, modernistic rock composition; electronic noise to punk-inspired jazz. Walter has been quoted as drawing inspiration from the fields of punk, death metal, free jazz, and no wave.\n\nThe Flying Luttenbachers formed in December 1991 in Chicago, Illinois as a punk jazz trio, with Hal Russell (tenor and soprano saxophones, trumpet), Chad Organ (tenor saxophone) and Weasel Walter (drums). The band derived their moniker from Russell's birthname, Harold Luttenbacher. Russell left the band in June 1992, and was soon replaced by Ken Vandermark for the recording of the Flying Luttenbachers' first 7\" record.\n\nThe band has since featured a frequently shifting cast of free jazz and experimental rock musicians, including Fred Lonberg-Holm, Kurt Johnson, Jeb Bishop, Alex Perkolup, Mick Barr, Ed Rodriguez, Mike Green and Jonathan Hischke. The Flying Luttenbachers have toured Europe and the US extensively with bands like The Locust, Arab On Radar, Lightning Bolt, U.S. Maple, Erase Errata, Bobby Conn, and Wolf Eyes. Walter moved from Chicago to Oakland, California in 2003, beginning yet another incarnation of the group. The live band played their final concert in November 2006. The Flying Luttenbachers project officially ceased operation in November 2007 upon the release of a final studio album (recorded solo by Walter).\n\nIn 2017 the band reformed for a tour in France invited by the Sonic Protest festival. The newest incarnation of the group appeared opening 3 shows for Oh Sees at Warsaw in Brooklyn, NY on October 17-19.\n\nSince 1996’s \"Revenge\" album, the Flying Luttenbachers’ musical output has been underlined by a gradually unravelling storyline concerning the self-obliteration of the planet Earth and the resulting aftermath. The 2006 album \"Cataclysm\" concerns an interstellar battle between two monolithic entities: \"The Void\" (a dark, silent spectre detailed on 2004’s album of the same name) and The Iridescent Behemoth (a massive planetoid being whose tale was told on 2003’s complex \"Systems Emerge From Complete Disorder\" album). The music energetically utilizes deliberate harmonic dissonance and the material operates on a principle of intelligent transformation of concise amounts of interrelated themes.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7708196", "categories": ["American instrumental musical groups", "American noise rock music groups", "American artist groups and collectives"], "title": "The Flying Luttenbachers"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7708241", "text": "Holden Special\n\nThe Holden Special is a mid-size car that was manufactured by Holden for Australasia. Introduced as the top-level trim in the new Holden FJ range of 1953, the Special was complemented by the entry-level Holden Standard and the mid-range Holden Business. The Business was in fact already available, introduced in July 1953 in the 48 series first seen in 1948. Three months later, the FJ was introduced, therefore forming a three-model lineup based around one car. A \"Standard\"-type variant also existed in the 48 series, but had been marketed simply as the \"Holden\".\n\nThere were also coupé utility and panel van variants, introduced in 1951 (48) and 1953 (FJ) respectively. These were both based on the Standard, although neither were badged this way. Collectively, the two cars were known as the Holden utility and panel van. From March 1957 the sedan, utility and panel van body styles were complemented by a new five-door station wagon. The wagon was marketed as the \"Station Sedan\" in both Standard and Special trim levels.\n\nThe Business sedan was deleted from the Holden lineup in mid-1959, during the FC production run, leaving just the Standard and Special. However, in 1962 the Holden Premier was introduced with the EJ series, becoming the new flagship, with the Special assigned as the mid-range Holden. This model trio continued until the 1968 HK series. The Standard became the Belmont, the Special the Kingswood, with the Premier staying as is. A new extended-length Brougham also joined the line-up, becoming Holden's topline offering.\n\nThe Business was introduced in July 1953, in four-door sedan form only, as a better equipped version of the basic Holden 48-215 series sedan introduced in 1948 and was specifically aimed at the taxi market. Improvements included passenger grab rails, door pull handles, seat kick plates, heavy-duty seats, floor mats, a heavy-duty battery and a boot lid handle. The Business Sedan was officially designated as model 48-215-257. Like the basic Holden sedan, it was powered by a 132.5 cubic inch six cylinder engine.\n\nOnly three months after the introduction of the original Business, the 48 series was replaced by the revised FJ Business. This series also included a new trim level, the Special, which was positioned above the Business in terms of price and equipment level. The new Business was designated as model FJ-217.\n\nThe FE series of July 1956 continued to offer Standard, Business and Special sedans but now featured new body styling, a longer wheelbase (up to 105 inches), a more powerful engine (up to 70 bhp), revised electrics, steering and interior trim. The Business sedan was designated as model FE-217. From March 1957 a station wagon body style was offered in the FE series, but only in Standard and Special trim.\n\nThe revised FC series introduced in May 1958 was a face-lift, offering only minor improvements over the FE. The Business was designated the FC-217.\n\nThe introduction of the FB series in January 1960 saw the Business sedan discontinued, leaving the Standard and the Special as the only Holden sedans for the first years of the new decade.\n\nHolden Produced 174,747 Holden FB's. The FB continued the General Motors Holden's (GMH) unique Australian mid-size GM offering, in contrast to the larger American, or smaller English variants. With predominantly US design features such as the FB's rear pointed twin fins, wrap around windscreen A-pillar, and new American Style dashboard with speedo featuring an orange-coloured indicator band instead of a needle pointer. The Holden FB and larger US variants such as the Chevrolet and Pontiac had a lot in common.\n\nThe FB Holden was manufactured with four common body styles. The Special sedan (model FB/225), Special station wagon (model FB/229), Standard sedan (model FB/215), Standard station wagon (model FB/219), Standard panel van (model FB/2104) and standard utility (model FB/2106).\n\nThe FB Holden also saw the end of the Nitrocellulose Lacquer (Duco) finishes. These early model FBs are very sought after in their original paint, as Holden introduced the \"Magic Mirror\" Acrylic finished in May 1960. With these change came new colours. Out were Nitro colours, Alpine Blue, Arctic Beige, Belmont Green, Biscay Green, Buckskin, Corana Grey, Desert Glow, Fernando Yellow, Lucerne Blue, Mandan Red, Raphael Ivory, Royal Glow, Sandstone Beige. All very rare colours to find on an FB Holden today, due to the five-month production window. On the subject of windows, the FB had 27 percent more glass area than the previous Holden the FC. The FB was also lower wider and longer than the FC.\n\nThe Holden FB panel van proved to be a big hit in the commercial sectors. The new 1960 FB panel van was the first Holden with a high roof. The FC Holden van was more or less a windowless station wagon in comparison.\n\nHolden FB is also noted as Holden's first export left hand drive car. The first of these cars being delivered to Hawaii.\n\nIntroduced in May 1961, the Holden EK was essentially a cosmetic variation on the previous model the FB, with the addition of the first automatic transmission option factory-fitted to a Holden. 150,214 vehicles were produced. The Hydramatic was fully imported from the USA (used in many General Motors cars at the time).\n\nThe Hydramatic transmission was generally limited to the Special sedan (EK/225) and Special station sedan (EK/229); however, some examples of dealer orders for automatic transmissions exist with one known standard sedan (EK/215) Hydramatic (\"Snowcrest White\", body no. 57, Sydney) with delivery paperwork to authenticate.\n\nFurther changes included the updating to electric windshield wipers (the previous model FB used vacuum wipers). The other changes were more cosmetic. Holden implemented stronger seat material \"ElastoFab\" due to the FB trim splitting at the seams quite easily, with the horizontal mid seat seam trim join. Holden also added a new grille, plenum chamber (Wiper Vent) cover, larger bumper bar over-riders, wider rear-view mirror, different badging and side trim style.\n\nIn 1962, Holden launched a completely new, lower-profile streamlined body with more interior space, new foam-padded seating and better all-round visibility.\n\nThe \"Premier\" model was introduced and the name \"Premier\", was to be identified with luxury Classic Holden Cars for 16 years. The EJ Premier, first with standard metallic paint and auto transmission, offered leather trim bucket seats, heater, carpet, floor console and whitewalls. The EJ had Duo Servo brakes, strengthened front suspension, safety belt anchorages.\n\nThe EH was introduced in 1963 and was the first Holden to incorporate the new \"Red\" engine, with a 7 main bearing crankshaft instead of the 4 main bearing crankshaft used in the \"Grey\" engine.\n\nThe HD was introduced in 1965. It had a completely new body, which was wider and longer than that of the EH and offered significant increases in passenger space, load space and equipment levels. Body styling exhibited strong similarities to Vauxhall's FC Victor of the previous year, including that car's unusual concave rear window. Disc brakes were offered for the first time on a Holden model  and the optional Hydramatic three–speed automatic transmission as used in the EH was replaced by a Powerglide two– speed unit.\n\nThe HR was introduced in 1966, featuring a revised grille, a reworked roofline and larger rear window (on the sedans), revised rear lights (on sedans and wagons) and changes to almost all exterior body panels. Other changes included revised ball joint front suspension, widened track, improved interior trim and woodgrain interior finish for the Premier models. Six months after the launch of the HR, all models were given a safety upgrade with the addition of front safety belts, windscreen washers, reversing lights, padded sun visors and a shatterproof interior rearview mirror.\n\n", "id": "7708241", "categories": ["Sedans", "Cars of Australia", "Holden vehicles", "Cars introduced in 1953", "Police vehicles", "Mid-size cars"], "title": "Holden Special"}

But Ekelöf moved towards romanticism and got betters reviews for his second poetry collection \"Dedikationen\" in 1934. A work that became influential for later Swedish poets was his \"Färjesång\" in 1941, a finely expressed blend of romanticism, surrealism and the dark clouds of the ongoing World War II.\n\nEdith Södergran did not achieve fame during her lifetime, but is today regarded as one of the foremost modernistic poets from the Nordic countries, and she has been translated into all major languages.

The resonating cavity is usually covered with goat leather.\n\nTraditionally kobyzes were sacred instruments, owned by shamans and bakses (traditional spiritual medics). According to legends, the kobyz and its music could banish evil spirits, sicknesses and death. \n\nIn the 1930s, when the first folk instrument orchestras were established in the Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, a new kind of kobyz came into existence. It now had four metallic strings and thus became closer to a violin. Such a modernized kobyz can be used to play both Kazakh music and the most complicated works of violin literature. One of the few western musicians to use the kobyz is Trefor Goronwy.\nThe kyl kyyak (Kyrgyz: кыл кыяк ) (sometimes spelt kyl kiak and sometimes without the 'kyl') is a stringed musical instrument used in Kyrgyz music. The instrument is carved from a single piece of wood (typically apricot) and typically measures 60–70 cm. It has 2 strings, one to provide melody and the other resonance. The kyl kyyak is played vertically with a bow and can be played on horseback. The strings and bow are normally made from horse hair and many instruments feature a carved horse's head. This all reflects the importance of the horse in Kyrgyz rural culture.\n\nBowed instruments may have originated in the equestrian cultures of Central Asia, an example being the Kobyz (Kazakh: қобыз) or kyl-kobyz is an ancient Turkic, Kazakh string instrument or Mongolian instrument Morin huur:Turkic and Mongolian horsemen from Inner Asia were probably the world’s earliest fiddlers. Their two-stringed upright fiddles were strung with horsehair strings, played with horsehair bows, and often feature a carved horse’s head at the end of the neck. ... The violins, violas, and cellos we play today, and whose bows are still strung with horsehair, are a legacy of the nomads.[3]\n\nIt is believed that these instruments eventually spread to China, India, the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East, where they developed into instruments such as the erhu in China, the rebab in the Middle East, the lyra in the Byzantine Empire and the esraj in India. The violin in its present form emerged in early 16th-Century Northern Italy, where the port towns of Venice and Genoa maintained extensive ties to central Asia through the trade routes of the silk road.\n\nThe modern European violin evolved from various bowed stringed instruments from the Middle East[4] the Byzantine Empire.[5][6] It is most likely that the first makers of violins borrowed from three types of current instruments: the rebec, in use since the 10th century (itself derived from the Byzantine lyra[7] and the Arabic rebab), the Renaissance fiddle, and the lira da braccio[8] (derived[5] from the Byzantine lira). One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument, including its tuning, was in the Epitome musical by Jambe de Fer, published in Lyon in 1556.[9] By this time, the violin had already begun to spread throughout Europe.\n\n\n", "id": "7708391", "categories": ["Bowed instruments", "Kazakhstani musical instruments", "Kazakhstani culture", "Drumhead lutes", "Necked bowl lutes"], "title": "Kobyz"}

First time it was mentioned in the \"List of property\" of the Lords of Humenne in 1436. From the beginning it was a foresters' village, what appeared until the present day. The fourth period mayor of the village is Emília Čopaková. \nFrom the nearly 700 inhabitants (1828 – 91 houses; 678 inhabitants) only 50 are now having their living place in Vysna Jablonka. \nOnce there used to be also a watermill, that you can nowadays see at the exposition of folk architecture of the Hummen museum.\n\nWhen the partisans withdrew, only two snipers, Šuhajda and Jacko remained. A short time afterwards, a German tank battalion came through the village and stampeded some horses. The two snipers went to catch them. While doing that they found four German rangers, who were unprepared, as they were full of bravado because of the tank battalion. \nAfter capturing the Germans, an important piece of information was found out from the feldwebel Otto Vilnes (one of the captured German soldiers), who said that the 82nd division will take the positions at the Low Beskyds on the 26th of December, with the mission to hold the line until the new and fresh 254th infantry division will come.\n\nThe Partisan Brigade \"Sergej\" decided to hold the line from the 82nd division group until the arrival of the Red Army. \n\nOn the 26th of December the Germans crossed Vysna Jablonka and at the \"Lukovsky Slip\" they were defeated by the Partisans.\n\nThe village's first Orthodox church was probably built in the 16th century. It definitely existed in the 17th century, since the first record about the church is from the year 1623, written by the resident priest. In folk tales, it is said that he stayed in the Potok slum.\n\nThe present-day church is located in the lower part of the village, at the western hill. Its construction is dated to the year 1766. In the landlord records from Hummene it was first mentioned in 1880.\n\nIn the year 1998, the church went to the Grecokatholic Church. The orthodox votari had to have their Masses in one room at the local municipal office.\n\nThrough the efforts of Empress Maria Theresa, the Orthodox in this area became united with Rome with the Union of Uzhorod in 1646. Any church built in this village would have been Greek Catholic, not Orthodox. The church remained Greek Catholic until the Communists outlawed the Greek Catholic Church and forced Orthodoxy on the people. The 1869 Census of County Zemplen (Administrative Records of the County Zemplen, Archive 2 of the County Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen) showed that there were 65 households in the village. One was Jewish, and if I remember correctly, one was Roman Catholic, all of the rest were Greek Catholic. In 1869 there were no Orthodox households or individuals in Vysna Jablonka. \n\nOne Roman Catholic is correct. He was my maternal great grandfather. He came from Poland with his daughter and mother-in-law and joined the Greek Catholic Church.\n\nThe village is in the northeast of Slovakia among the Low Beskyds of the Laborec Highlands. It is situated close to the river Rieka which is 3 km (ca. 1.4 miles) away. The municipality lies at an altitude of 385 metres and covers an area of 24,832 km².\nThe settlement has the highest elevation in the Humenne district. The next biggest cities being Humenne, Snina and Medzilaborce, 32 km, 25 km and 24 km away, respectively.\n\nThe village lies in the northern territories of Slovakia. The population of animals depends on the situation. \nThere is a population of wolves (canis lupus), brown bears (ursus arctos), foxes and lynx. They hunt the local deer...\n\n", "id": "7708433", "categories": [], "title": "Vyšná Jablonka"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7708463", "text": "Cylon (1978)\n\nCylons are a fictional race of robots in the original \"Battlestar Galactica\" TV series. They are the primary antagonists of the series and are at war with the Twelve Colonies of humanity. The Cylons also appeared in the short-lived 1980 spin-off series \"Galactica 1980.\"\n\nAn updated version of the original Cylon also appears in the re-imagined series: briefly in a flashback battle sequence in \"\", in hand-to-hand combat with a young William Adama after they had shot each other's fighters down; and several in the show finale \"Daybreak\", on board an old Cylon refuge known as \"The Colony\".\n\nThe Cylons were created by a reptilian race, also called Cylons. However, the reptilian race died out centuries earlier, leaving behind only their race of robots.\n\nThe Imperious Leader is the leader of the Cylon Alliance and most advanced Cylon model. According to the IL-Series Cylon \"Lucifer\", the Imperious Leader is an IL-Series Cylon, although it does not look like an IL-Series Cylon. All of the Imperious Leaders look identical.\n\nThe Imperious Leader has a third brain and a body shell resembling the reptilian Cylons. The original novelization of the pilot episode states that the Imperious Leader's third brain is specifically designed to emulate the human mind (solely for the purpose of anticipating human actions). Since the novelization, however, also specifically describes the Cylons as living, organic reptilian beings, rather than robots, it is not clear whether the robot Imperious Leader has a third brain or not. The reptilian look of the Imperious Leader suggests the question whether actually all living Cylons have died out.\n\nOne Imperious Leader was killed at the Battle of Carillon (pilot episode). His successor was possibly destroyed during the Battle of Gamoray (episode: \"The Living Legend, Part 2\").\n\nIn the original 1978-79 series, the voices of both the Imperious Leader and Count Iblis are identical, having been provided by Patrick Macnee (who played Count Iblis on camera). In the \"Galactica 1980\" episode \"Space Croppers\", the voice of the Imperious Leader was provided by Dennis Haysbert.\n\nAlthough they look much more civilian than centurions, IL-series Cylons act as commanders for the military and governors for civilians of the Alliance . They have two brains, and a mostly transparent head through which various lights can be seen pulsing. They also have a metallic, humanoid face with two eye scanners (compared to the single eye scanner of the Centurion models), and wear clothing (full-length glittering robes). Two IL-series Cylons have been featured onscreen, both of which have an effete human-sounding voice, unlike the flat mechanical tones of Centurions. They are:\n\nTwo additional IL-Series Cylons are shown on-screen on the Cylon capitol of Gamoray during the Imperious Leader's visit, which occurred during the episode \"The Living Legend, Part II\". Lucifer refers to the second Imperious Leader as being upgraded from an IL-model like himself.\n\nCommand Centurion are Centurions with gold armor. These are the lower commanders for individual military units, though they can be responsible for entire Basestars and garrisons. The most well-known Cylon of this model is Commander Vulpa (so identified in \"The Cylon Death Machine,\" Robert Thurston's novelization of \"The Gun on Ice Planet Zero\"). Their voices are slightly lower pitched than regular Centurions.\n\nIn the novelization of the original series it is stated that there is an elite class of Command Centurions (referred to as First Centurions), roughly equivalent to feudal Counts, which act as executive officers to the Imperious Leader and are not subordinate to the IL-Series, and (like the IL-series) they were also said to have multiple brains. In the TV series these are actually seen on screen, though very rarely, and are distinguished from other Command Centurions by black bands on their gold armor. Vulpa was originally of this class but had been demoted and stationed on ice planet Arcta.\n\nMilitary androids with silver armor. Basic Centurions make up the ground forces and pilots of the Alliance military. Although Earth's Roman Centurions commanded a unit of eighty men, Cylon Centurions form the rank and file of the Cylon forces.\n\nCenturions are armed with a powerful energy weapon, often referred to as a blaster rifle. They also have bayonets and swords for close combat and the execution of prisoners.\n\nSome Centurions in the series have been given names:\n\nThe Cylon Centurions—the type most often depicted in the original \"Battlestar Galactica\"—were strikingly similar to the Imperial stormtroopers of \"Star Wars\" (in fact, both were designed by the same concept artist, Ralph McQuarrie). The similarities were so strong that it was one of the factors that prompted 20th Century Fox's lawsuit for copyright infringement against Universal Studios, owners of the \"Battlestar Galactica\" copyright. However, the lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nBoth the gold Command Centurions and the silver Centurions had their voices vocalized with the use of an EMS Vocoder 2000.\n\nThere is also a unique Cylon with glittering robes, with a metallic humanoid face. They are seen in the Imperious Leader's delegation to Gamoray in \"The Living Legend\". This is evidently some kind of civilian Cylon, as Gamoray is said to have a very large community of civilian Cylons, though how civilian Cylon society differs from its military is never explored. This is the only known kind of civilian Cylons. However as they must have had some kind of admission to the reception of the Imperious Leader it can be assumed that they are not typical civilian Cylons; they were perhaps members of some kind of aristocracy.\n\nThe Cylon \"humanoid\" is a rather new model, probably first built long after the destruction of the Twelve Colonies of the Humans.\n\nAlthough entirely mechanical beneath an artificial skin, the humanoid model is, in fact, an android, featuring a superficial, human appearance, as well as a condescending attitude toward the non-humanoid Centurions.\n\nTwo Cylon humanoids are featured in the episode \"The Night the Cylons Landed\" of \"Galactica 1980\", one of which is named Andromus.\n\nThe Cylons are described as a devoted race that spends no time in any idle pursuits, and they employ several models, but only of necessary spacecraft, such as these:\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1978 \"Galactica\" movie and series and the 1980 spin-off, the Cylons were created by an extinct reptilian race that were also called Cylons, as related by Apollo in the premiere episode. In the episode \"War of the Gods\", Count Baltar mentions that the reptilian Cylons were ultimately \"overcome by their own technology\" (particularly after the Imperious Leader was created, despite having had a \"slight error\" in its programming), and recognizes Iblis's voice as that of the Cylon leader, and Iblis counters that if that were true, it must have been \"transcribed\" over a thousand yahren (years) ago.\n\nAt the beginning of the series the Cylons are singularly devoted to the destruction of humanity. The war started when the Cylon Empire sought to expand into the territory of the Hasaris, and the Human Colonies intervened on behalf of the conquered Hasaris. Due to those events, the Cylon Empire now viewed the entire human race as a target.\n\nCylons are led by the Imperious Leader, an IL-Series Cylon elevated to a supreme leadership position over all Cylons. All Cylons, from the IL-series down, typically repeat the phrase \"By Your Command\" when responding to any order.\n\nThe Cylon Empire is also responsible for tributary powers under the aegis of the Cylon Alliance. The Ovions (an insectoid race enslaved by the Cylons and transported to the planet Carillon for mining purposes) are the only known member of the Cylon Alliance shown onscreen. Aside from the Ovions and (the defeated) Hasaris, the only other known race conquered by the Cylons are the Delphians, which are mentioned to have been exterminated in \"The Living Legend.\"\n\nCylon society appears to be almost exclusively military. Until the discovery of Gamoray, which the Colonial fleet had targeted for its rich fuel reserves, no civilian Cylon outpost had ever been seen by anyone.\n\n\nThe Berkley book series also explored two other aspects of Cylon design. The first is the development of multiple brain status. This allows Cylons additional thinking and deductive abilities. The second is an unexplained talent for knowing when a human is lying, which was suggested in the episode \"The Lost Warrior\".\n\nPresented in \"The Gun on Ice Planet Zero\" book, the second of the two novels written before the network insisted the Cylons become robots, their multibrain status is the surgical inclusion of an auxiliary brain, allowing for higher-level thinking abilities. The command centurion and garrison commander on planet Tairac, Vulpa, demonstrated this ability.\n\n\nAccording to the Maximum Press comic of \"Battlestar Galactica\", just prior to the start of The Thousand Yahren War, the Cylons's Imperious Leader made a deal with the mysterious and demonic Count Iblis (meaning \"Satan\" in the Arabic language) to betray his entire race in exchange for power that would allow him to \"become like Count Iblis\". Count Iblis, however, having lied about the process of \"empowerment\", instead changed the Imperious Leader into a cybernetic entity, more machine than organic being. Enraged, the Imperious Leader swore revenge and became more and more driven by conquest and warfare.\n\nIn the Maximum Press comic, the Cylons were originally led by a ruthless, conquest and expansionism-driven emperor named Sobekkta, one of the original living Cylons, who were a race of intelligent humanoid reptiles.\n\nIn \"Battlestar Galactica\" # 16 \"Berserker!\" During a planetary search, Apollo, unfortunately comes across a lone Mark III prototype Cylon. This advanced Cylon is more creative and adaptive like humans in its strategy making the Mark III more capable to defeat humans. However, the existing Cylons deemed this advanced Cylon prototype more a threat to them due to its unquenchable megalomania to rule so they marooned him far from the Cylon empire until needed (if ever).\n\nThe Cylons also appear in the official computer game adaptation, which is a prequel to both the original and re-imagined series.\n\nLarami came out with a bubble toy in 1978 called the Battlestar Galactica Cylon Bubble Machine as well as a line of other inexpensive toys.\n\n\n", "id": "7708463", "categories": ["Cylons", "Fictional extraterrestrial life forms", "Fictional robots"], "title": "Cylon (1978)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7708467", "text": "Cylon (reimagining)\n\nCylons are a fictional artificially-intelligent \"species\" envisioned in the \"Battlestar Galactica\" science fiction series and related franchises. Originally created to serve human needs like other machines, a series of events involving the transfer of a human's consciousness into a Cylon's neural network led Cylons to evolve into sentient, self-aware beings. The original Cylons were purely mechanical.\n\nThe Cylon was reimagined in the second \"Battlestar Galactica\" television series and its prequel \"Caprica.\" The first configurations (Centurions) were robots. Others were cyborgs whose different configurations incorporated biological elements, including some that were nearly indistinguishable from humans.\nOne of the series’ core themes is ‘All of this has happened before and will happen again’. Cylon Centurions were invented twice: Once thousands of years before the events of \"Battlestar Galactica\" and later they fought a war against the Thirteenth Tribe on Earth.\n\nThe second Centurion creation is detailed in the prequel series \"Caprica\". There they were created by Zoe Graystone and her father Daniel Graystone, owner of Graystone Industries.\n\nThe \"Caprica\" Cylon is a combination of programming done by Zoe and Daniel's MCP-enhanced (\"Meta-Cognitive Processor\") Graystone Industries U-87 Robot. A common activity on Caprica was to participate in a virtual world (V-World) that allowed players to live an alternate existence. The original Cylon was developed as a place to house Zoe's avatar (virtual existence) after she is killed in a bombing on a maglev train in \"Caprica\" Episode 1. Her father sees her avatar in V-World and forces her best friend Lacy to take him to her there where she explains that she is much more than a simple digital simulation. She has Zoe's memories from a neural scan Zoe developed to extend a V-World character into a virtual instance of the person. The digital Zoe says to her father, \"I don't feel like a copy\", and she becomes the basis of the first Cylons.\n\nCylons were originally accepted into Caprican culture as robotic workers after a group of them (under direct remote control by Graystone himself, with the help of his wife Amanda) successfully thwarted an attack on the public at Atlas Stadium by the Soldiers of the One (STO). The Cylons then spread throughout the colonies as a worker class, but because they had basic self-awareness they became increasingly resentful of their servitude.\n\nIn \"Battlestar Galactica\", the Cylons were created thousands of years before the series began. They destroyed the Thirteenth Tribe living on the original Earth 2,000 years before.\n\n\"BSGr\" Cylon society consists of three classes: biological ruling-class androids (pejoratively \"skinjobs\"), labor-warrior class (Centurions), and a transport-air warrior class (Basestars and Raiders). Basestars and Raiders are partly biological cyborgs and as such are vulnerable to biological threats such as disease. Raiders and Centurions, while intelligent, were inhibited from exercising free will, although the Hybrids that controlled Basestars did exercise some autonomy and were respected by the skinjobs.\n\nThe skinjobs lead Cylon society. Some are sleeper agents, programmed with false memories to think they are human. Cylons can convincingly interact with humans and are capable of intimate relationships.\n\nThey have limited superhuman abilities such as increased stamina and strength and the ability to connect with computer systems. Cylons are more sensitive than humans to some forms of radiation and more resistant than humans to others. They can upload their memories to other copies of their model through a central station. Another Cylon, of the same model, can then access these memories. The humanoid Cylons have the ability to distinguish between copies by sight, unlike Centurions and humans.\n\nCenturions are often called toasters by humans, partly a reference to their metallic construction but also to demean them. \"Toaster\" was also used to derogate skinjob, another derogatory term (and an homage to the film \"Blade Runner\" in which \"BSGr\" star Edward James Olmos has a supporting role). Centurions were also termed \"chromejobs\" or \"bulletheads\". The (chronological) origin of the word \"toaster\" can be found in the prequel Caprica, episode 10 which was created after BSG had ended. After a car crash made the first-ever test Cylon inoperable, it was considered \"toast\" after which Tomas Vergis joked \"or a toaster\". The term \"skinjob\" is originally used in Caprica, episode 17, where a new body is being discussed for an avatar (and AI) of \"Zoe\". The parents emphasize it will be \"with skin\" (as opposed to the Cylon, metal prototypes) which she then calls \"a skinjob\".\n\nCylons were initially unable to produce children with each other. They turned their attention to mating with humans. Their crossbreeding experiments in facilities called \"farms\" are unsuccessful. They theorize that love is necessary for them to procreate, because \"God is love\" in their theology. This leads to a successful experiment in which an Eight and a human, Karl Agathon, fall in love and produce a daughter named Hera.\n\nSkinjobs can download their consciousness into another body when the body they are using dies, giving them virtual immortality. These downloads have a limited range, requiring the Cylons to build a \"Resurrection Ship\" to capture them. If not within range of a Resurrection Ship, downloading is unavailable and a Cylon's death is permanent. The downloading process is shared by the semi-organic Raider spacecraft, which allows Raiders who have been killed several times to become more formidable fighters (\"Scar\"). The Centurions do not download. Resurrection Ships function as boosters for the central Resurrection Hub. Without the Hub resurrection is not possible.\n\nThis technology was first shown in Caprica in an attempt to \"resurrect\" deceased relatives in a so-called \"resurrection\" program (first called that way in episode 13) in virtual reality where one could meet and interact with those one was mourning for.\n\nCylons have an ability referred to as \"projection\", a form of realistic daydreaming that allows them to change the appearance of their surroundings in their own mind (e.g. making the corridors of a ship look like a forest, etc.). They have the ability to touch, smell, etc. the fantasy environment. They can share projections and create virtual individuals as part of the fantasy. This ability allows them to express their subconscious desires.\n\nIf a Cylon is deemed dangerous by the other models, he or she may be \"boxed\" – deactivated with consciousness and memories placed in storage. This may involve a particular copy or an entire line. Boxed consciousnesses are stored in the Resurrection Hub and can be unboxed. The term was also used in the prequel Caprica episode 10 which discusses \"boxing\" a defunct test cylon (as literally placing it in a crate for \"deep storage\"). As Caprica is the prequel this is chronologically the first time of its use from which the Cylons derived their own definition.\n\nBetween 3–4,000 years before the Second Cylon War, it is implied that the humans and Cylons of Kobol fought each other, but the nature of the conflict remains unrevealed. The Thirteenth Tribe were Cylons who fled Kobol and settled on a planet they dubbed Earth. Eventually, they developed the ability to reproduce sexually. Resurrection technology fell into disuse and was lost. The Final Five redeveloped resurrection, following warnings by mysterious \"angels\" that a Kobol-like disaster was coming. When life on Cylon Earth was destroyed in a nuclear war between the thirteenth tribe and their mechanical Cylon creations (stemming from the latter's maltreatment at the hands of the Tribe), the Final Five downloaded into an orbiting vessel.\n\nThe Final Five wanted to warn the other Twelve Colonies to treat their Cylon workers well to prevent another catastrophe. However, without faster than light (FTL) travel, they required approximately 2,000 years to make the journey (relative to human time, while only a few years passed inside the ship due to Special Relativity). When they arrived, the Twelve Colonies' Cylon Centurions had revolted and the first Cylon War was raging. It lasted roughly twelve and a half years.\n\nThe Final Five learned that these Centurions were trying to develop organic bodies through experiments on humans, resulting in the first Hybrid. To end the war, the Final Five helped the Centurions develop skinjob model numbers One to Eight (model number Seven's creation was sabotaged by One) and resurrection technology. The war ended with an armistice and an attempt by the Colonies to establish diplomatic relations between the parties. Instead, the Cylons disappeared for forty years.\n\nThe first of the Colonial skinjobs, One John Cavil, refused to let the Final Five's concern for humanity blind them. He boxed the Final Five. He then periodically sent them to the Colonies to see how terrible humanity was.\n\nAfter forty years, the Colonial Admiralty sent Battlestar \"Valkyrie\" on a covert mission close to the armistice line to gather intelligence on Cylon activity. A stealth ship from the \"Valkyrie\" crossed the armistice line, but was intercepted by the Cylons. Three years later the Cylons initiated a surprise attack on the Colonies. The attack was successful because a Cylon agent, later known as Caprica Six, infiltrated Caprica's colonial defense network with the unwitting complicity of renowned scientist Gaius Baltar and created backdoor programs to shut down the network and its defenses. The attacks wiped out billions of humans, nearly the entire colonial population. Two Battlestars – \"Galactica\" and \"Pegasus\" – survived. A fleet of civilian ships was scattered throughout the neighboring space. Together they fled into deep space.\n\nThe Cylons pursued them while initiating the next phase of their evolution, procreation. Female human survivors were detained and used in experiments to create Cylon-human hybrids. The experiments were unsuccessful leading the Cylons to conclude that the missing component was love. They tested this by using an Eight posing as Lt. Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii from \"Galactica\" to seduce a marooned Galactica officer, Lt. Karl \"Helo\" Agathon on Caprica. They fell in love. The Eight abandoned the Cylons, helping Helo to escape. The couple later produced the first viable human/Cylon birth. This Eight joined the fleet with Helo. She later married Helo, joined the Colonial military and received the call sign \"Athena\".\n\nTen months after the initial attacks, Eight Sharon Valerii (call sign \"Boomer\"), attempted to assassinate Commander Adama under the influence of unexplained programing unknown to her. She was unaware that she was a Cylon before the attack, though she had been uneasy because of unexplained blackouts (during various attempts to sabotage \"Galactica\"). A vengeful crew mate, Cally Henderson killed her. She downloaded into a new body and settled on Cylon-occupied Caprica in her former apartment, unable to relinquish her human identity. She led a campaign for better treatment of the humans. She and other like-minded Cylons influenced the Cylon civilization, which withdrew from the colonial home worlds and pursued benevolent treatment of the humans and then reconciliation.\n\nDuring this time, the half-human half-Cylon hybrid, Hera Agathon was born on \"Galactica.\" Fearing that the Cylons might capture the child, President Laura Roslin faked Hera's death and secretly had her adopted by a human woman.\n\nThe humans settled on a barren planet they dubbed New Caprica. The refuge lasted a year before the Cylons found them. The Cylons occupied the new human settlement, at first peacefully but later forcefully and more viciously as the human Resistance increased. In the end they used punitive methods to keep the humans in line, including summary executions and infiltration by seemingly sympathetic Cylons. One such infiltrator was an Eight model who manipulated Felix Gaeta into giving her a list of people the Resistance desired to free from Cylon detention whom she then had executed.\n\nFour months later the colonials escaped with the help of a resistance movement and the efforts of both the \"Galactica\" and \"Pegasus\". The escape required Athena's help. She entered the Cylon facility and took the keys to the various Colonial landing craft. Prior to this a Three found out from a human oracle that Hera was alive and on the planet. She rescued Hera after her adoptive mother was killed during the escape. The \"Pegasus\" sacrificed itself to save the crippled \"Galactica\", but the crew survived, joining \"Galactica\".\n\nThe Cylons then adopted the colonials’ mission to find the home of the Thirteenth Tribe, a planet they called Earth, intending to settle there. They resumed pursuit of the fleet, but upon reaching the Lion's Head Nebula, dispatched a Basestar to investigate. The Basestar took on board a canister left by the Thirteenth Tribe. The canister contained an airborne virus that proved deadly to the Cylons. The virus persisted through the download process so the Basestar that had been dispatched for the investigation was abandoned to avoid contamination. The colonial fleet discovered the Basestar and captured the ailing Cylons. The colonial fleet's attempt to use the virus to wipe out the Cylons was defeated when Helo, repulsed by the strategy, had the captive Cylons killed while out of range of a resurrection ship.\n\nMeanwhile, Boomer turned increasingly anti-human. She was charged with Hera's care, but Hera rejected her. During a truce negotiation, Boomer told Athena that her daughter was alive but sick on the Baseship. She invited Athena to come to the Baseship and rejoin her people, because the occupation showed that humans and Cylons were incompatible and that humans would never truly accept her. Later, desperate for her child, Athena convinced Helo to kill her so she could resurrect on the Baseship. Once there, she retrieved Hera with the help of Caprica Six who killed a hate-filled Boomer to prevent her from killing the child. She had tried to prevent Athena from taking Hera to the humans and declared that Cylons were never meant to have children. Caprica Six returned with Athena and was detained by Adama in Athena's old cell.\n\nAs the pursuit continued, internal relations among the Cylons began to break down. A Three violated her programming by actively seeking information about the Final Five, seeing a vision of them on the Algae Planet where the Colonials stopped to get food. From that she was able to identify them. She and her \"twins\" were then \"boxed\". Within the fleet a musical activation signal (a version of All Along the Watchtower) was received by the Final Five, awakening their memories and bringing them together. Two were \"Galactica\" crew members (Saul Tigh and Galen Tyrol), while Samuel Anders was an athlete and Tory Foster a political operative. They kept their discovery secret. Tigh and Anders remained loyal to the humans, willing to fight and possibly die for them. Tyrol and Foster were ambivalent, with Tyrol having pro-human leanings. Foster became increasingly anti-human, murdering Tyrol's wife without remorse after she learned the truth about their identities. After their realization, the fleet came under attack but, during the battle, a Cylon Raider identified Anders and he and his fellow Raiders broke off the attack, refusing to fight.\n\nThis set off a debate in the Cylon government regarding the Raiders. Ones, Fours and Fives voted to \"lobotomize\" the Raiders to make them acquiescent. Twos, Sixes and Eights, led principally by a Six named Natalie, became convinced that the Raiders had sensed the presence of the Final Five. The tie was broken by the unprecedented event of Boomer voting against the rest of her models to side with the Ones, Fours and Fives. Natalie objected to Cavil's actions and removed inhibitor circuitry from the Centurions, granting them free will and independent thought. The Centurions then killed the models who were “lobotomizing” the Raiders.\n\nIn response, Cavil lured Natalie and her forces into a trap beyond resurrection range and slaughtered them. Only Natalie's crippled Basestar survived. With her Raiders destroyed except for some Heavy Raiders and the surviving Twos, Sixes and Eights (minus Boomer), Natalie allowed Two Leoben Conoy to locate Kara Thrace and ally with the humans. A deal was struck: the humans would help the rebels unbox the Threes so that they could identify the Final Five, and the rebels would lead the humans to the Resurrection Hub and help them destroy it so Cavil would lose resurrection forever. The humans transferred half of their Vipers to the Rebel Basestar. Fearing for Hera, Athena murdered Natalie, causing the Hybrid to jump the Rebel Basestar, with Roslin on board, away before everyone was ready. The Hybrid took the Basestar to the Hub where the allies had the human Vipers towed into battle by Cylon Heavy Raiders so they could catch the Cylons by surprise. The plan worked and the Hub's FTL drive was taken out, stranding it. While the Rebel Basestar engaged two other Basestars, Helo and an Eight boarded the Hub to unbox D'Anna and found her already unboxed by Cavil and Boomer. The three escaped and the Vipers nuked the Hub, destroying it and Cylon resurrection capability.\n\nAfter a standoff, the identities of the four Cylons in the human fleet were revealed and together they found the devastated Earth, a nuclear wasteland. There, Tigh, Anders, Foster and Tyrol got flashes of their life on Earth and Tigh learned the identity of the fifth member: his dead wife Ellen. The humans and rebel Cylons (minus D'Anna), abandoned Earth in search of a new home together. The humans and Cylons ended up striking a deal: in return for joining the fleet as full members the rebels would upgrade the fleet's FTL drives with Cylon technology, increasing their jump distance by at least three times. This led to a political coup and failed mutiny, but left Anders seriously injured, although with his true memories returned as the accompanying brain damage broke the mental blocks Cavil had placed on his original identity. After telling the others as much as he could, Anders slipped into a coma from which he partially emerged while acting as \"Galactica's\" hybrid.\n\nCavil revealed that he had a resurrected Ellen Tigh as his prisoner, ever since her download after she was killed on New Caprica. Her resurrection restored her true memories, although her only company was Cavil and Boomer, whom he'd let in on the secret. After Cavil planned to dissect her brain to try to regain resurrection technology, Boomer helped Ellen escape to the fleet as part of a plan to kidnap Hera so the Cylons could study her.\n\n\"Galactica\" and some of the rebel Cylons assaulted the Cylon space station that was the Cylon homeworld, to rescue Hera while the Rebel Basestar protected the fleet. During the battle, Boomer, who had begun to feel remorse for kidnapping Hera, killed the Four that was starting to dissect the child and carried her back to her parents. Athena then killed Boomer. The rescue team returned to \"Galactica\" where Cavil led a Centurion assault, but was defeated. He took Hera hostage, but was convinced to create a permanent peace with the humans in exchange for the Final Five giving him resurrection technology.\n\nTyrol learns that Foster murdered Cally and breaks the download, causing the Cylons to attack again. Cavil kills himself. An unmanned Raptor is struck by an asteroid, causing the dead pilot (Racetrack) to fire eight nuclear missiles into the Colony, knocking it out of orbit and into a black hole, destroying it and every remaining One, Four and Five. \"Galactica\" jumps away and arrives at a habitable planet. The humans and rebel Cylons settle there while the rebel Centurions are given their freedom and the Rebel Basestar to find their own destiny. Anders flies the human fleet and all its technology into the Sun. 150,000 years later, it is revealed that the planet they settled on is our Earth, while Hera was Mitochondrial Eve, which means all modern humans are partly descended from the humanoid Cylons.\n\nThe Cylon Centurion is a mechanical infantry model, made less intelligent than human models. \"BSGr\" Centurions retain the silver appearance, robotic body, helmet-like head and oscillating red bar eye of their forbearers but are larger, taller, stronger, more agile and have a more streamlined appearance. They also have retractable guns built into their lower arms, bladed fingertips and heavy armour.\n\nThe Centurions were monotheists who believed in a single loving God.\n\nThe first colonial Centurion is seen and is identified as a 'Cybernetic Lifeform Node'. Built on contract for the Caprican Defense Ministry, the Cylons are to replace human warriors on the battlefield (\"Caprica\" pilot).\n\nThe U-87 prototype Cylon contains a copy of the consciousness of Daniel Graystone's daughter, Zoe Graystone. Daniel Graystone conceives of the Cylons as a slave race and demonstrates this by instructing the prototype to rip her own arm off. After catching it interacting with the family dog, he realises that the prototype contains Zoe's consciousness and attempts without success to force her to admit her identity. She is able to defeat the tests he attempts, and convinces him that she is just a robot. Upon learning that Graystone is about to erase her memory, she escapes.\n\nThe \"Battlestar Galactica\" miniseries displays an original model Centurion on display in \"Galactica\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s museum hangar. The original Centurion is also depicted in a diagram reviewed by the armistice officer in the opening scene.\n\nIn \"\", Centurions are almost identical to those from the original series, except they are rendered using CGI and have exposed joints. The Centurion in the museum hangar is retconned as a CGI version with exposed joints. Initial-model Centurions are among those seen defending the Cylon colony from an assault by Colonial and rebel Cylon forces (Part 2 of \"Daybreak\").\n\nThe body had synthetic skin, although this model was still primitive and was mechanical rather than biological.\n\nCenturions do not download into new bodies when they are destroyed, according to screenwriter Ronald D. Moore The Hybrids have something to do with the programming of the Centurions. When the virus infected the Hybrid on the infected Basestar, the Centurions shut down (\"Torn\"). However, Centurions can function independently when no Basestars or skinjobs are nearby. A Centurion immediately fires upon an Eight when she unplugs a Hybrid (\"Faith\"). It is unclear whether this was in willful defiance of the Hybrid or as a result of the removal of their higher function inhibitor modules (\"Six of One\").\n\nAfter the inhibitor modules that restrict higher functions, granting them independent thought were removed, although still largely servile, the Centurions were shown to exhibit human-like behaviour, such as politeness and consideration (e.g., responding to \"please\").\n\nThese Centurions are taller than their predecessors, and are sleeker. They possess less of a humanoid structure, averaging a head taller than humans. They retain the bipedal structure of the first model, as well as rough hands and feet. The feet of the new Centurions are a simple two-toed form that produces a distinctive sound when they walk as the toes move and touch the ground. They retain the distinctive, oscillating red \"eye\", as well as a rudimentary mouth (even though they cannot speak). The hands are much thinner and visibly segmented, and more claw-like (they can cut flesh and mortally wound a human, making them effective close-combat weapons.) These claws can be modified at will, to a more 'finger-like' digit or less of a razor-sharp weapon.\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive feature of this model is the twin cannons built into each hand, mounted on the side, that can be deployed by retracting the hands. It was originally established that the Centurions could not move while firing their cannons, however in later seasons they were seen to walk and even run while firing. The Centurions carry heavy weapons, such as anti-aircraft rockets that are strapped to their backs, for missions where their cannons are not enough. Most Centurions can be destroyed or at least damaged by small-arms fire, however most require substantial artillery or special rounds to be destroyed (a Centurions party that boarded Galactica were especially strong, and required explosive rounds to be destroyed, as regular rounds proved completely ineffective).\n\nThese Centurions greatly outmatched the previous model. They were better-armoured, stronger, and carried internal weapons (as opposed to their predecessors, who needed to carry weapons such as rifles and pistols, like their human creators).\n\nThe later form of Cylon Raiders are biomechanical entities integrated into small fighter spacecraft. They resurrect when they die. Raiders are subservient, and were compared to trained animals by the humanoid Cylons. A Raider nicknamed \"Scar\" developed a personality (\"Scar\"). Scar was the Cylons' top gun, driven by a bitter hatred of humans. He was killed and reborn many times. Raiders do not use vocal communication, appearing to communicate through unspecified electronic signals. Modern Raiders, unlike their predecessors in the First Cylon War, are alive, with a complex system of veins, organs and biological fluids contained within their main body. The Raiders are programmed, but began with some measure of autonomy and personality. When one Raider saw a Final Five in the human fleet during an attack, it retreated, leading the remaining Raiders back to the Basestar. The Raiders then refused to fight the humans, for fear of harming their Cylon kin. This led to the lobotomy vote.\n\nWell-trained Colonial pilots, even nuggets, can beat a Raider in most situations. The Raiders' primary advantage seemed to be in their massive numbers: while Galactica carries around 40 Vipers, Cylon Basestars support 300-600 Raiders. The Raiders are maneuverable, once described by Kara as a \"squirmy son of a bitch\", and most human pilots were unable to keep them in sight for more than a few seconds.\n\nThe Raiders' primary weapons are two kinetic energy guns mounted on the underside of their wings, close to the main body. They may carry conventional missiles and tactical nuclear weapons. Raiders, by revealing their red \"eye\", can transmit deadly computer viruses or signals to enemy ships, which strike with brutal efficiency and can shut down Colonial vessels, turning off their power and making them easy prey. If all else fails, Raiders sometimes attempt suicide attacks. A single Raider can destroy a sizeable transport.\n\nThe Raiders from the First Cylon War were larger spacecraft driven by Centurion pilots, and not alive. These are used by the remaining First War Centurions guarding the Original Hybrid and the Cylon Colony, and later became obsolete.\n\nThe later Cylon Raiders are different from Cylon Heavy Raiders. Like the raiders of the First Cylon War, the Heavy Raiders are transports and attack bombers, and are primarily piloted by Sixes and Eights.\n\nAlthough they made only a single appearance in the original continuity (the episode \"The Night the Cylons Landed\" from \"Galactica 1980\") humanoid Cylons are the focus of the reimagining. They are usually known as \"the Cylons\", or derogatorily as \"skinjobs\" or \"toasters\". Skinjobs are indistinguishable from humans due to their creation through synthetic biology, employing real bones, flesh and blood rather than metal, but still possess a \"digital molecular structure\". Some are programmed to believe that they are \"organic\" until otherwise informed.\n\nThe Cylons can communicate nonverbally, but do not have a hive mind, even among a single model, and are most often shown talking to one another.\n\nThe thirteen distinct humanoid models are divided into the \"Final Five\" that originated on Earth, and \"Significant Seven\" (the latter term is only used by the \"Battlestar Galactica\" producers). The Final Five are unique, and are the last survivors of the Thirteenth Tribe. They developed the Seven (originally eight) in conjunction with the Centurions of the Twelve Colonies. Each copy shares biology and general personality throughout their model, but they develop into distinct individuals. The Final Five showed the Centurions how to make skinjobs and attempted to give them human characteristics (love, mercy), thinking that these characteristics would prevent war. \n\nPrior to the \"Final Five\" arriving to stop the first Cylon War on Caprica, the Centurions had already made their first humanoid, called the Hybrid, for the purpose of controlling the baseship. Once the Final Five arrived on Caprica, they transferred their technology to the Centurions and gave them eight fully humanoid models created by them.\n\nCylon society is made up of the seven, whose types are numbered One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six and Eight. The extinct Seven model (the \"Daniel\" series) was destroyed by a One decades prior to the Colonies' destruction.\n\nAs revealed towards the end of season 4, there is a 2000 year gap between the exodus of the first humanoid Cylons (the Final Five) from the destruction of life on Earth due to a robot Centurion war there, and their arrival at Caprica in the middle of the Caprican robot Centurion war. Originally, the Final Five had left Earth both to seek a new home and to warn the other Twelve Colonies about the dangers of mistreating Centurions so that they might avoid the fate of Earth. However, at the time FTL (faster than light) starship jumping technology was unknown, so they made the journey using slower than light technology, resurrecting themselves when their bodies wore out over the span of 2000 years. \n\nIt should be noted that when the Earth was nuked, 2000 years prior, the Final Five Cylons had already planned for this event and were resurrected onto their baseship in orbit when their bodies were destroyed in a global nuclear attack that wiped out all life on Earth. This resurrection was the event which triggered the Final Five Cylons to begin their 2000 year journey to Caprica, only to find out upon arrival that humans and Centurion robots had begun fighting towards extinction just as they had 2000 years prior on Earth.\n\nThe Final Five arrived at Caprica to discover that the Caprican Centurions had already begun experimenting with creating humanoid Cylons by creating the first Hybrid to control their baseship. As part of the agreement to end the war with humans, the Final Five Cylons gave the Caprican Centurions eight humanoid Cylon models and a resurrection ship. \n\nDuring the 40-year gap between the end of the first Cylon war and the second Cylon war on Caprica, Cavil, model number One of the eight humanoid Cylons that the Final Five had designed and created, rebelled against the Final Five and took command of the Centurions and of the other humanoid Cylons. In order to get rid of the Final Five who blocked him from continuing the Cylon war, he tricked the Final Five into to living on Caprica with their memories erased and false memories implanted. He was deluded into believing that he could show the Final Five that they were wrong about humans by letting them suffer with the humans as their civilization was destroyed (as a result of him restarting the Cylon war) and then restoring their memories while resurrecting them on the Cylon baseship. Cavil thought this lesson would help the Final Five realize that humans were flawed creatures and thus persuade them to take his side.\n\nEllen, the original creator of the eight humanoid models, programmed them with a belief in a single all-loving God. She did this because she wanted the Cylons to know love and to be peaceful and to avoid war in the future. However, Cavil rejected his programming of believing in God. Other Cylons, particularly the D'Anna model, justified attacking the humans perhaps as a form of religious fundamentalism, with the goal of remaking the world as a Cylon One-God utopia.\n\nIn addition, Cavil regarded the creation of humanoid Cylons as a mistake and believed that Cylons should return to a purely mechanical form so that they could experience the world in ways not limited by human senses. For example, he said that when a star explodes into a supernova, he wants to see the X-rays and gamma rays with his eyes, and not be limited by biological human eyes. \n\nCavil was fearful of the mechanical Centurions, rejecting the secret removal of circuitry to prevent the Centurions from having free will in Season 4. When Centurions on one of the Cylon baseships received this modification and thus developed free will, they revolted against Cavil because they rejected his policy of removing the biological brains of the Raider ships and returning them to a purely mechanical form so that they would follow orders without emotion interfering. This small rebellion left the Twos, Sixes and Eights in charge of one of the baseships in the Cylon fleet. The rebel baseship later forms an alliance with the human fleet after being attacked by Cavil's Cylon fleet and left to drift in space without FTL propulsion.\n\nThe skinjobs are responsible for command decisions. While the command structure has not been fully explored, some hints at organization are known. At the end of the mini-series, a group of skinjobs debate what to do, and one speaks authoritatively, to which another responds, \"by your command\", a reference to the original series. They can freely impose blocks on the behavior and cognitive programming of Centurions, Raiders and Hybrids. Multiple skinjobs with blocked memories are spread among the surviving humans, including members of \"Galactica\"'s crew.\n\nA Cylon council (made up of multiple copies of several models) appears to cast votes collectively by model, indicating that model plays an important role in the structure of Cylon society (\"Precipice\"). Some models are implied to have higher or lower ranks than others. During the occupation of New Caprica, a select group of individuals, who mostly had been within the Colonies, such as Boomer and Caprica Six, seemed to have seniority within their model. One of each model was seen deliberating and discussing their course of action, with each of the 'senior' copies representing the opinion of their model.\n\nAlthough little is known about Cylon psychology, it is clear that they share many human emotional vulnerabilities. This is evidenced by Gina's catatonic state as a result of the severe trauma of her abuse at the hands of the \"Pegasus\" crew. This abuse was presented in the form of multiple sexual assaults, battery, starvation and outright torture. Six/Caprica Six also revealed that Cylons exist by 'projecting' an environment of their choice on the real/physical world.\n\nOnes subvert consensus by undertaking many actions without the knowledge or consent of their siblings, such as turning against the Sevens and the Final Five, and then reprogramming their siblings to hide this.\n\nThe main antagonist of the series, John Cavil, initially poses as a priest (\"Lay Down Your Burdens\"). His true identity is revealed when a second copy boards \"Galactica\" and reveals his Cylon nature. Cavil's role in society is contradictory. He occasionally serves as a devil's advocate, pointing out the absurdity of his fellow Cylons and their religious zealotry. He was revealed to be a One (\"Six of One\").\n\nCavil has a sadistic, Machiavellian streak that none of the other Cylon models share. He tortured Saul Tigh by gouging out one of his eyes and showing it to him. He took pleasure in blackmailing Ellen Tigh into providing sexual favours in exchange for releasing Saul from captivity on New Caprica.\n\nCavil is an atheist (alone among the seven models), and often mockingly uses air quotes when saying the word \"God\". His opinions of humans are contradictory. He is one of the most violently anti-human Cylon models, advocating a policy of culling humanity down to a \"controllable number\". He claimed to have been against the destruction of the Twelve Colonies and advocates a unique Cylon Society, not one that emulates its creators. After arranging Tigh's release, Cavil further manipulated the situation by again blackmailing Ellen to betray the human resistance on New Caprica and threatening to kill Saul if she did not comply.\n\nCavil is aloof compared to the other models, though Boomer implies that Cavil has begun teaching her his views that Cylons should not emulate humanity. Cavil knows aspects of Cylon lore that the others models do not. His knowledge of the Final Five led him to box the D'Anna and the other Threes to ensure that whatever she had learned about the Final Five stayed hidden.\n\nHe was made in Ellen's father's image. Ellen also named him \"John\". He hates this name and shows deep resentment towards Ellen at being 'limited' by having to live in a humanoid body.\n\nOne was the first model and helped the Final Five create the other seven. Therefore, Ones knew about the Final Five while the others knew only that they existed. For an unstated reason, Cavil rejected the human trait of mercy and turned against the Final Five.\n\nWhen the Final Five were resurrected, Cavil implants new memories for their life in the Twelve Colonies. He also alters the original programming of the seven other models so that searching for, talking about, and even thinking about the Final Five was strictly forbidden.\n\nOnes are played by Dean Stockwell.\n\nLeoben first appears as a smuggler at the munitions depot at Ragnar Anchorage, where he was exposed as a Cylon (mini-series). Twos are religious zealots, carrying a pathological, and sometimes sexual, obsession with Starbuck. His Cylon identity was revealed (\"Six of One\").\n\nTwos are skilled at deceit. Conoy manipulates Starbuck into thinking that a young girl he had kidnapped on New Caprica is her biological daughter. Twos display cunning minds and the ability to find and exploit others' weaknesses. Unlike other Cylons, Twos appear to be prescient and on several occasions prophesy future events.\n\nTwos are played by Callum Keith Rennie.\n\nD'Anna Biers was a reporter for the Fleet News Service. Roslin and Adama grant Biers access to all areas of Galactica to investigate her suspicions of a military cover-up surrounding civilian deaths aboard the Gideon. Their belief is that Biers will discover that military personnel deal with the same pressures and fears as the rest of the fleet, and that the events were a tragic mistake. The Biers model used the documentary as a means to relay information that Sharon was alive to Cylons on Caprica (\"Final Cut\"). D'Anna was revealed to be a Three in the episode \"Downloaded\".\n\nThrees are among the more aggressive models, and share a fatalistic understanding of the Cylon religion, believing that everything that happens is the will of God. Their religious devotion masks a deep questioning by Threes about why God allows bad things to happen (Theodicy).\n\nThrees possess an \"alpha-female\" aggressiveness, advancing themselves as de facto leaders in any situation. They are often rivals of Ones and Sixes. The rivalry with the Sixes partly stems from when Caprica-Six killed a Three to save Samuel Anders from torture and death. D'Anna and Caprica-Six later reconcile and both of them are involved in a relationship with Baltar. Baltar seduces D'Anna by exploring her crisis of faith, which leads to her secretly committing suicide (a major Cylon taboo) to experience resurrection. She feels these near-death experiences will answer questions regarding her faith, notably the identity of the Final Five. D'Anna eventually sees the faces of the Final Five (\"Rapture\"). Unfortunately, as she does so, the other Cylons vote to box all Threes. Cavil tells her that what she had seen regarding the Final Five was unacceptable and that her memories would be kept in \"cold storage\". D'Anna, but not the other Threes, is later unboxed (\"The Hub\").\n\nThrees are among the more anti-human Cylons. D'Anna tells Baltar that she believes that humanity must die to prevent future generations of humans from seeking revenge (\"Exodus\" Part II). She is temporarily the leader of the \"rebel\" faction of Cylons that makes peace with the human fleet, but when the first Earth is found to be a devastated ruin, she decides to stay there and die rather than continuing the cycle of death, exodus and rebirth.\n\nThrees are played by Lucy Lawless.\n\nO'Neill poses as a human physician who treats Starbuck for a gunshot wound in what was supposedly a resistance hospital on Caprica (\"The Farm\"). In reality this was a Cylon \"farm\" set up to breed human-Cylon hybrids using captured humans. Simon performed invasive tests on Starbuck's reproductive organs. He was revealed to be the 4th model in the episode \"Six of One\". Fours are consistently medical specialists.\n\nAnother Four poses as a married man in the Colonial Fleet. Cavil at one point asks Simon to leave his life behind and destroy the ship he lives on. He defies this order to protect his wife and her child by committing suicide and flying out of an air lock. He was not close enough to a Resurrection Ship and therefore died permanently (\"\"\"\").\n\nFours are played by Rick Worthy.\n\nDoral debuts as a public relations worker for the abortive \"Galactica\" museum (miniseries). Another Five sneaks aboard the \"Galactica\" and detonates an explosive (\"Litmus\"). This event prompts the fleet-wide announcement that Cylons can have a human appearance. He was revealed to be the 5th model in the episode \"Downloaded.\"\n\nDuring the Occupation of New Caprica, the Fives are anti-human and aggressive. They specialize in public relations and control, using large-scale events and media manipulation.\n\nFives are played by Matthew Bennett.\n\nThe first model explicitly revealed to be a Cylon in the mini-series, Sixes often use seduction to their advantage. Important copies include Shelly Godfrey, Gina Inviere, Head Six, Caprica Six and Natalie.\n\nOne of the Sixes, later known as Caprica Six, on her way to meet with Baltar, murders an infant by breaking its neck. This could either be considered sociopathic or a mercy killing due to the coming Cylon attack. She saves Baltar's life when his house was struck by a blast wave from the Cylon attack.\n\nCaprica Six has a love-hate relationship with Baltar, alternately defending him to other Cylon models or leaving him to suffer at their hands.\n\nA reincarnation of Caprica Six commits the first incident of Cylon-on-Cylon violence, killing a Three with a rock to save Ander's life.\n\nCaprica Six was imprisoned on \"Galactica\" after helping Athena escape from the Cylons with Hera. She offers to testify against Baltar. While in the brig, she has a relationship with Saul Tigh that results in the first Cylon-Cylon pregnancy in 2,000 years, which ends in a miscarriage.\n\nCaprica Six has an \"Inner Baltar\" which only she sees, similar to how Baltar has an \"Inner Six\" that only he can see; Inner Baltar serves as a sort of conscience for Caprica Six and as an advisor in times of trouble, as Inner Six does for him. Inner Baltar appears at least once to Baltar himself. Before their true nature is revealed, speculation rises that Baltar is a Cylon. Inner Baltar and Inner Six appear to Baltar and Caprica Six – all four sharing a moment together – as the first part of the revelation that the \"Inners\" are divine beings (referred to as \"Angels\") manipulating both the Colonials and Cylons into fulfilling \"God's plan\" (series finale).\n\nGodfrey was on Galactica after the Cylon attack. She accused Baltar of treasonously sabotaging human defenses, and therefore of killing several million people (\"Six Degrees of Separation)\". She also appears in \"\" TV movie.\n\nGina acted as a contractor for \"Pegasus\" and was in a relationship with Admiral Cain. When Cain discovered that Gina was a Cylon agent, she ordered her crew to \"push her programming\" in an attempt to see if Gina was vulnerable to emotional trauma. Gina later escaped with Baltar's aid, assassinated Cain and founded a resistance group in the fleet, preaching peace with the Cylons. While it seemed that Gina developed feelings for Baltar and wanted to pursue him, she detonated a nuclear warhead (provided by Baltar) that destroyed Cloud Nine, other fleet ships and generated an electromagnetic signature, the detection of which ultimately led the Cylon fleet to New Caprica.\n\nOther important Sixes include Natalie, who originally leads the rebel Cylon faction against Cavil's faction before she is killed by Athena in a misunderstanding, and Sonja, who was elected to represent the rebel Cylons in the Colonial fleet's Quorum of Ships' Captains.\n\nSixes are played by Tricia Helfer.\n\nDaniel was the seventh Cylon model (\"No Exit\"). Ellen refers to Daniel as an \"artist, and so sensitive to the world\". She was very close to Daniel, which enraged Cavil; he felt that Daniel was Ellen's favorite and became jealous. Cavil poisoned the amniotic fluid used to mature the Daniel copies and then corrupted Daniel's genetic code. This sabotage meant that no further Sevens could be created. The original was also killed with Samuel Anders stating at one point that \"Daniel died\" after regaining his true memories. \n\nFans speculated that Starbuck or her father was a version of the corrupted Seven line. Instead Daniel is merely a plot device to explain the missing number and to expand on Cavil's character (noting that Daniel is essentially the Abel to Cavil's Cain). The Sevens were a springboard for \"Caprica\", where Daniel Graystone is the name of a main character played by Eric Stoltz; this Daniel is the creator of the Colonial Centurions.\n\nSevens are never seen in the series, and their physical appearance is never described.\n\nAt the end of the miniseries, a Six says \"By your command\" to an Eight. This phrase is usually spoken to the Imperious leader in the old series by Centurions. It seemed to give this particular Eight a leadership role.\n\nSharon \"Boomer\" Valerii first appears as a Raptor pilot aboard the \"Galactica\". Her true nature as a Cylon was revealed at the end of the miniseries. She acted as a sleeper agent, unaware of her true nature and programmed to carry out attacks on the fleet without realizing what she is doing. She was revealed to be an Eight in the episode \"Downloaded\".\n\nThe other significant Eight, Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon, married Karl \"Helo\" Agathon, rebelled against the Cylons and joined forces with the Colonials. Her child with Helo, a daughter named Hera, is the first Cylon/human hybrid. Such a child is the subject of a Cylon prophecy. Its importance increased as it was a 'child born of love'. Shortly after Hera's birth, Roslin decides to mislead the Cylons into believing the child has died. Her plan involves lying to Athena and Helo, and giving the child to an adoptive mother, Maya. While aiding the Colonials in their plan to rescue the humans on New Caprica, Athena sneaks into a Cylon storage facility and steals launch codes for the civilian ships trapped on New Caprica. She is discovered by D'Anna, who informs her that Hera is still alive, citing strange dreams and a prophecy by a human mystic as proof. Athena, believing this to be a ruse, kneecaps D'Anna. During the exodus from New Caprica, Hera's caregiver is killed and D'Anna finds the baby. Boomer later tells Athena that Hera lives. Athena has Helo kill her (Athena), allowing her to download into a new body within the Cylon fleet. With the help of Caprica Six, she rescues Hera and returns to \"Galactica\".\n\nEight is described as \"weak\" by Baltar's Head Six, and Eights usually appear more compassionate and sympathetic than other Cylons. However, they fully supported the destruction of the Colonies. The actions of Boomer and an Eight who had a duplicitous affair with Felix Gaeta on New Caprica make it clear that Eights are capable of homicide and betrayal. Eights are also capable of intense loyalty and have the ability to break from Cylon traditions and laws to help human friends or family. They vote to save humanity in the Cylon civil war that Boomer starts. She hesitates for a while when Cavil influences her, but in the end chooses to support the humans, even if it means that she must give up her life.\n\nAthena becomes completely assimilated in human culture. Her child and husband become her life's focus. She is the only Cylon to create a family. The Eight's perceived fragility camouflage great strength and direction. In one episode, Athena hardwires herself to Galactica, hacks into a Cylon fleet and shuts them down.\n\nEights are played by Grace Park.\n\nCavil killed and boxed the Final Five. Later he resurrected them, purged their memories and sent them to live among the humans. The other six models had no knowledge of the Final Five's identities, presumably blocked by Cavil, though they were aware of the existence of five absent models who were not to be spoken of. When D'Anna (a Three) attempts to learn their identities, Cavil boxes her entire model line as punishment. In the final episode of the third season, four of the final five are revealed to be characters with long histories on the \"Galactica\". Their purpose, and how and why they were hidden from the rest of their kind, is a major plot point of the fourth and final season when Ellen Tigh is revealed to be the fifth member.\n\nThe Final Five were Cylon models who could not be named or researched by skinjobs (\"Rapture\"). They were the original humanoid Cylons, born 2,000 years before the series, on Earth, as part of the Thirteenth Tribe. (\"Sometimes a Great Notion\") They were born to Cylon parents through sexual reproduction, rather than built. They were the researchers who rebuilt the Cylon resurrection technology that had been abandoned when the Thirteenth Tribe gained the ability to procreate. Saul and Ellen were married at the time, while Tyrol and Foster were in love and planned to marry (\"No Exit\").\n\nWhile on Earth the Final Five learned of the upcoming attack on the Colonies from beings (\"Angels\") only they can see. They placed the resurrection technology on a ship in Earth orbit. When the nuclear attack kills them, they resurrect on the ship and head for the Colonies to warn them. They arrive during the First Cylon War, unbeknownst to the humans, and make a deal with the Centurions: stop the war and they will help them build human bodies. They build the first model, One (Cavil), who helps them build seven other models (\"Sometimes a Great Notion\").\n\nCavil then kills and boxes the Five and removes the memory of their identities from the other Cylons. He later unboxes them, replacing their memories. Cavil periodically seeds them among the human populations starting with Saul, and then Ellen, to show them the evils of humanity.\n\nThe Five are fully Cylon – although \"fundamentally different\" from the others. Unlike the other models, they do not have model numbers.\n\nOther Cylons do not talk about the Five (\"Torn\").\n\nSaul Tigh (Michael Hogan) and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) are \"Galactica\" officers, while Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) is an athlete on Caprica. Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) is a political operative who is rescued from Caprica and works for Roslin. Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon), is the fifth member, as Saul later realizes as more of his memory returns. (\"Sometimes a Great Notion\") Ellen resurrected after she is poisoned by Saul for giving rescue mission plan to Cavil on New Caprica. This restores her memory of her life as a Cylon (\"No Exit\").\n\nThe Five awaken when they begin to hear strange music. This seems to affect other Cylons. A Raider scans Anders and disengages an attack. Aboard \"Galactica\", Caprica Six tells Roslin that she can feel the Final Five and that they are near. (\"He That Believeth In Me\") Twos, Sixes and Eights believe that the Raiders called off the attack because they sensed the Final Five, something with which the Ones, Fours and Fives disagree. This disagreement leads directly to the Cylon Civil War, in which the Twos, Sixes, and Eights rebel (\"Six of One\"). A standoff between \"Galactica\" and the rebel Baseship exposes the four as Cylons to the humans, but Lee Adama, in his capacity as acting President, grants them amnesty as part of an alliance (\"Revelations\").\n\nOnly Anders and Ellen regain their complete memories: when Anders gets shot in the head, it seems to break Cavil's block on his memory, while Ellen's resurrection restores all of her memories. Cavil had planned for the Five to die in the destruction of the Colonies, download, regain their true memories and apologize for their faith in humanity (\"The Plan\"). Instead, four of the Final Five survive the destruction of the Colonies without resurrecting (Tigh and Tyrol were on \"Galactica\" and Tory and Anders survived through luck) while Cavil kept Ellen alive so she could suffer more and learn her \"lesson\". Cavils' plan thus fails, as all of the Five (with the possible exception of Foster) maintain their loyalty to humanity.\n\nThey play a major role in ending the second war, taking a prominent role in the Battle of The Colony, especially Anders who acts as \"Galactica's\" Hybrid and shuts down the Colony's weapons and Hybrids. The Five also nearly bring a peace between human and Cylon by exchanging resurrection technology (which can only be rebuilt by the combined knowledge of the Five) for peace.\n\nThey see each other's memories and Tyrol learns that Tory had murdered his wife. In a rage, he strangles her, shattering the temporary peace, although a fortuitous nuclear explosion and Cavil's subsequent suicide effectively ends the war moments later.\n\nAfter escaping and reaching a new Earth, Anders flies the fleet into the Sun, destroying it and himself, leaving only three of the Final Five alive.\n\nThe Hybrids resemble human beings inside an immersion tank similar to a Cylon rebirthing tank. The Hybrids are cyborgs, consisting of conduits and other connectors mated to biological elements. The Hybrid is not one of the \"thirteen models\". It represents a step on the path from mechanical Centurion, to partially bio-mechanical Raider, to Hybrid, to skinjob. Hybrids are so integrated into the basestar's functionality that they are, for all practical purposes, its brains.\n\nHybrids continually speak what most of the humanoid Cylons consider to be gibberish, although there is some difference of opinion on this point. Many Cylons believe a hybrid's conscious mind is completely mad and the functions it performs are part of a deeper state of mind in connection with the ship. Caprica Six states that the Conoy model believes that every word a hybrid says is channeled from the Cylon god. A Hybrid is not allowed to vote in the Cylon democratic process, though it sometimes objects to the resulting decisions, for example, leaving another basestar full of disease-infected Cylons to their fates.\n\nOne Hybrid, considered the \"First Hybrid\" in Cylon lore, was the result of experiments on humans during the First Cylon War and appears to be more coherent and prophetic than the others. It went rogue as early as the end of the First War, and is protected by model 0005 Cylons called Guardians, who consider it their god. According to the skinjobs, the First Hybrid and its Guardians are legends. The Colonial Fleet accidentally clashes with the Guardians, destroying them, the First Hybrid along with its basestar. The First Hybrid has the appearance of an old man, whereas the standard Hybrids look like young women and are identical.\n\nAfter he is shot in the head and enters a vegetative state, Samuel Anders is connected to a datastream and as a result develops Hybrid-like abilities, whereupon he acts as \"Galactica\"'s Hybrid. When hooked up, he speaks and acts like a Hybrid. This shows that apparently under special circumstances, normal Cylons, or at least the Final Five, can become Hybrid-like beings.\n\nThe Basestar Hybrids are played by Tiffany Lyndall-Knight. The First Hybrid is played by Campbell Lane.\n\nHumanoid Cylons, except for the Cavil models, follow a monotheistic religion. Religious fanaticism partially motivates their attempted genocide of humanity. Despite their origins the Cylons believe themselves to be spiritual beings. This monotheism seems to share some of the characteristics as the Abrahamic religions: belief that God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent, that he will one day deliver divine retribution and that he intervenes in the mundane world. Their beliefs are different from the Abrahamic religions in that they deal with issues such as consciousness, enlightenment and reincarnation.\n\nMoore said that this spirituality comes when a species becomes sentient and self-aware – questioning faith and religion and about what happens after death.\n\nThe different Cylon models have slightly different ways of talking about and dealing with their god, reflecting the different aspects of humanity that each Cylon model reflects. Ones do not all believe in God and can be agnostic or atheist. In contrast, Twos are fanatically religious.\n\nSome Cylons are physically stronger than humans. While this is obvious with respect to Centurions, the extent to which the Twelve are also is unclear. In the miniseries, William Adama fought with a Two who, despite suffering from the effects of radiation, proved to be stronger. The Two managed to break off a metal pipe to use as a club and lift Adama off the floor with one arm. Another Two was able to break apart a pair of metal handcuffs while under interrogation (\"Flesh and Bone\"). A Six engaged Kara Thrace hand-to-hand and proved to be exceptionally fast, agile and strong (\"Kobol's Last Gleaming II\"). Despite this Cylons are vulnerable to most of the same things as humans. The Two who fought Adama was beaten to death with a flashlight, while the Six who fought Thrace was impaled by a piece of rebar. While the Twelve may match or exceed human strength, they do not display superhuman powers or resilience. Cylon skin appears just as vulnerable to breaking as human skin, bleeding just as a comparable wound would in a human.\n\nCylons' mental faculties are sufficiently similar to those of a human to allow for manipulation. Cain and Thrace exploited this fact while 'interrogating' Cylons. The experience of death (even with resurrection) is traumatic and can leave deep emotional damage.\n\nCylons are susceptible to an ancient virus that can be transmitted by rodents to which humans are immune, lymphocytic encephalitis. This virus was carried on a beacon left by the Thirteenth Tribe at the Lion's Head Nebula millennia before and disrupts all organic Cylon technology including Raiders, Hybrids (which in turn disrupts Centurions) and the skinjobs. The humans speculate that the beacon was accidentally contaminated when someone sneezed. The Cylons believe that a critical symptom of this virus, a harmful bioelectric feedback, can be transmitted during a download and attempt to prevent infected Cylons from downloading. The only immune Cylon is Athena, who had given birth to a half-human child and thus 'inherited' human antibodies from her offspring (although it is unclear whether she retained this immunity after downloading).\n\nDr. Cottle developed a vaccine after some Twelves were infected on a basestar near the Lion's Head Nebula. The disease requires regular booster shots to keep an infected Cylon healthy. The Cylons failed to develop a cure or a vaccine to the virus.\n\nCylons' silica pathways are affected by certain forms of radiation, such as that surrounding Ragnar Anchorage. It is assumed but not stated that this radiation affects all of the skinjobs as the station was chosen as a refuge by Commander Adama before he learned of the existence of biomechanical models. The radiation had deleterious effects on the Two they found at Ragnar Anchorage but not on Adama. This suggests that humans are not vulnerable to this type of radiation.\n\nPlutonium is used for Baltar's Cylon Detector because its radiation affects humans and Cylons differently. The detector was dropped as a method of exposing hidden Cylons early in Season 2 as the revelation that Boomer (a test subject) was a Cylon convinced the command staff that the detector did not work.\n\n\n", "id": "7708467", "categories": ["Cylons", "Fictional cyborgs", "Fictional artificial intelligences", "Fictional robots", "Human-derived fictional species"], "title": "Cylon (reimagining)"}

Shaw began her singing career in the 1960s and is still singing today. Her music has often been sampled in hip hop music, and used in television commercials.\n\nShaw was first introduced to music by her uncle Jimmy Burgess, a jazz trumpet player. In an interview with \"The New York Times\", she told the reporter “He [Jimmy Burgess] introduced me to good music through records - Dizzy [Gillespie], Miles [Davis], a lot of gospel things, and Al Hibbler, who really knows how to phrase a song.” In 1952, Burgess brought her on stage at the Apollo Theater in Harlem to sing with his band. Shaw's mother did not want Marlena to go on tour with her uncle at such a young age. Instead, she enrolled Shaw into the New York State Teachers College in Potsdam (now known as the State University of New York at Potsdam) to study music. She later dropped out of school, got married, and had five children, but never gave up her singing career.\n\nShaw began to make singing appearances in jazz clubs whenever she could spare the time. The most notable of these appearances was in 1963 when she worked with jazz trumpeter Howard McGhee. She was supposed to play at the Newport Jazz Festival with McGhee and his band, but left the group after getting into an argument with one of the band members. Later that year, she got an audition with Columbia label talent scout John Hammond. Shaw did not perform well during the audition because she was too nervous. Undeterred, she continued to play small clubs until 1966. Her career took off in 1966 when she landed a gig with the Playboy Club chain in Chicago. It was through this gig that she met with representatives of the Chess Records music label, and soon signed with them. She released her first two albums on their subsidiary Cadet Records. A 1969 album track \"California Soul\", a funk-soul tune written by Ashford & Simpson and originally issued as a single by American pop quintet The 5th Dimension, later became a staple of the UK rare groove scene. This song has appeared in television commercials for Dockers, KFC and Dodge Ram trucks.. Because of television advert exposure, it may be Shaw's best known recording in the UK. Unable to find her own style at Chess, she moved to the jazz-oriented Blue Note Records in 1972.\n\nIn 1977 she released an LP \"Sweet Beginnings\" on Columbia that contained, arguably, Shaw's finest moment: \"Yu Ma / Go Away Little Boy\", a medley containing the old Goffin and Carole King standard, originally recorded by Nancy Wilson. The album also contained the track \"Look At Me, Look At You\", popular on the U.K. rare groove scene. She also recorded one of the disco era's biggest hits, a remake of \"Touch Me in the Morning\", also on Columbia Records.\n\nIn 1982 Marlena recorded the Gary Taylor ballad called \"Without You In My Life\" from the LP \"Let Me In Your Life\" that was jointly produced by Johnny Bristol and Webster Lewis on South Bay records. This had moderate chart success in the USA. In 1983 she recorded the vocals for \"Could It Be You\", a track by Phil Upchurch on his \"Name Of The Game\" album.\n\nShaw still performs and records today. In 2001, and again in 2007, Shaw was one of the performers at the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Buddy Montgomery\n\n", "id": "7708477", "categories": ["Cadet Records artists", "Northern soul musicians", "Blue Note Records artists", "Jazz-blues musicians", "Musicians from New Rochelle, New York", "1942 births", "Living people", "American female singers", "American jazz singers", "African-American singers"], "title": "Marlena Shaw"}

He has been the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge since 1991. His research interests include political theology, ecumenical theology, Christian theologians and theologies, theology and poetry, the shaping of universities and of the field of theology and religious studies within universities, hermeneutics, and inter-faith theology and relations. He is the founding director of the Cambridge Inter-Faith Programme and a co-founder of the Society for Scriptural Reasoning.\n\nFord was raised as an Anglican in the Church of Ireland in Dublin. His father died when he was 12 years old and he was raised by his mother, Phyllis Mary Elizabeth Ford.\n\nFor his undergraduate education, he studied at Trinity College Dublin, where he was active in politics, debate and journalism. He was elected a Scholar in classics in 1968. After completing his degree, he interviewed for jobs at British Steel Corporation and Rolls-Royce, but then was offered a scholarship to St John's College at the University of Cambridge and decided to study theology for a few years before going into business. He earned his bachelor's degree in theology at Cambridge and went on to earn his Master of Sacred Theology degree at Yale Divinity School; he also did graduate work at the University of Tübingen. He gained his doctorate at Cambridge, writing his dissertation on Karl Barth and biblical narrative under the direction of Donald MacKinnon and Stephen Sykes. The result was the book \"Barth and God's Story\" (1981). Ford later received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of Birmingham.\n\nFrom 1976–1991 Ford was a lecturer (later senior lecturer) at the University of Birmingham. Living in the inner city, his theology was shaped by a multi-faith experience, and he also became involved in a local Anglican church in the evangelical tradition. As his housemate was involved in renovating derelict houses, he lived in some of those houses and became a house manager for one of them. In the university's theology department, he became close to theologian Daniel W. Hardy and went on to marry Hardy's daughter.\n\nIn 1991 he moved to Cambridge to become the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge. He is the first professor in this post who is not in the Anglican ministry. He helped found and chairs the management committee of the Centre for Advanced Religious and Theological Studies at Cambridge. He is a member of St John's College, a fellow of Selwyn College, and a foundation member of Trinity College.\n\nHe is highly regarded for his scholarship, is a sought-after lecturer and preacher, and serves as an advisor to the bishops of the Anglican Communion. His books have met with wide appeal; his \"The Modern Theologians: An Introduction to Christian Theology in the Twentieth Century\" (Blackwell, 1997), now in its third printing, is the leading textbook on modern Christian theology in the English-speaking world, China and Korea. His \"Theology: A Very Short Introduction\" (Oxford University Press, 1999), part of the Very Short Introductions series, has been translated into many languages, including Chinese, Korean, Indonesian, Romanian, and Kurdish.\n\nWhen Ford came to Cambridge in 1991, the theology department focused almost exclusively on Christianity. Ford assisted in the realisation of a development plan which included a new building, a new Centre for Advanced Religious and Theological Studies, new endowed research posts, and the development of the Cambridge Theological Federation (the university's consortium of Anglican, Methodist, and United Reformed seminaries). The university went on to add two new posts in Islamic studies, a new post in New Testament, and a new endowed post in theology and natural science. A Roman Catholic institute and institute for Orthodox Christian theology were added to the consortium of seminaries. The Centre for Jewish-Christian Relations was established in 1998, followed by the Centre for the Study of Muslim-Jewish Relations in 2006.\n\nFord was introduced to interfaith dialogue in the early 1990s while on sabbatical at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton, where his father-in-law, Hardy, director of the centre, introduced him to Jewish theologian Peter Ochs. Hardy and Ford participated in meetings of the early \"textual reasoning\" group founded by Ochs at the American Academy of Religion, reading the Tanakh, Bible, and Quran together with Christian and Muslim scholars. In 1996 Ford, Hardy and Ochs founded the Society for Scriptural Reasoning; Ford has been an active promoter of scriptural reasoning in subsequent papers and lectures.\n\nIn 2002 Ford became the founding director of the Cambridge Inter-Faith Programme. Among his activities are lectures at international conferences on Muslim-Christian relations. In October 2007 he helped launch a letter by 138 Muslim scholars to 25 Christian leaders, including the Pope, the Orthodox Patriarchs, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the heads of the world alliances of the Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist and Reformed churches, calling for peace and reconciliation between Christians and Muslims for the survival of the world. The following month, he was one of the signatories on a Christian response seeking Muslim forgiveness.\n\nIn 2008 the Sternberg Foundation awarded Ford its Gold Medal for Inter-Faith Relations.\n\nIn November 2012 he was awarded the Coventry International Prize for Peace and Reconciliation (http://coventrypeaceprize.org.uk/)\n\nFord is active both within the university and in public life. He has been a trustee for the Center of Theological Inquiry at Princeton since 2007 and a member of the board of advisors for the John Templeton Foundation since 2008. Other professional memberships include the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature.\n\nHe is an editorial board member of \"Modern Theology\", the \"Scottish Journal of Theology\", \"Teaching Theology and Religion\", the \"Irish Theological Quarterly\", and the \"Journal of Anglican Studies\". He is an editorial advisory board member for the \"Current Issues in Theology\" series published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2008 Ford was an academic member of the World Economic Forum Council of 100 Leaders for West-Islamic World Dialogue. He is an external advisor for the Centre for Christian Studies in Hong Kong (since 2006), a trustee for the Golden Web Foundation, a developer of a global multimedia publishing system with a focus on pre-modern world history, heritage and culture (since 2006), and a consultant for L'Arche Communities, a federation of over 100 communities for people with severe mental disabilities (since 1993).\n\nIn 2011 he was one of 1,750 signatories to a letter to US President Barack Obama urging US intervention in the Libyan civil war.\n\nHe is married to Rev. Deborah Ford, daughter of the late Daniel W. Hardy. She is an assistant chaplain at Addenbrooke's Hospital, part of the Cambridge University Hospital system.

AD 306/315 – c. 353/366) was a Latin Roman Christian poet, perhaps the earliest female Christian poet whose work survives. A member of one of the most influential aristocratic families, she composed the \"Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi\", a cento composed with verses by Virgil re-ordered to form an epic poem centred on the life of Jesus.\n\nProba belonged to an influential family of the 4th century, the \"Petronii Probi\". Her father was Petronius Probianus, Roman consul in 322, while her mother was probably called Demetria. She had a brother, Petronius Probinus, appointed consul in 341; also her grandfather, Pompeius Probus, had been a consul, in 310. Proba married Clodius Celsinus Adelphus, \"praefectus urbi\" of Rome in 351, thus creating a bond with the powerful \"gens\" Anicia. They had at least two sons, Quintus Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius and Faltonius Probus Alypius, who became high imperial officers. She also had a granddaughter Anicia Faltonia Proba, daughter of Olybrius and Tirrania Anicia Juliana.\n\nHer family was pagan, but Proba converted to Christianity when she was an adult, influencing her husband and her sons, who converted after her. Proba died before Celsinus. She was probably buried with her husband in the Basilica di Sant'Anastasia al Palatino in Rome, where, until the 16th century, there was their funerary inscription, later moved to Villa Borghese before disappearing. The bond between Proba and this church might be related to Saint Anastasia, who probably belonged to the \"gens\" Anicia: Proba and Celsinus could have received the honour of being buried \"ad sanctos\" (next to the tomb of a saint), because of the particular veneration of the Anicii for this saint.\n\nWith her husband she owned the Horti Aciliorum at Rome, on the Pincian Hill.\n\nTwo poems are attributed to \"Proba\", and only one is extant. Most modern scholars identify Faltonia Betitia Proba as the author of these works, with the other possible identification being her niece Anicia Faltonia Proba.\n\nThe first poem, now lost, is called \"Constantini bellum adversus Magnentium\" (\"The War of Constantine against Magnentius\") by the \"Codex Mutinensis\". It dealt with the war between Roman Emperor Constantius II and the usurper Magnentius. Proba was involved to this war through her husband Clodius Celsinus Adelphus, who had been \"praefectus urbi\" of Rome in 351, that the same year Italy passed from the sphere of influence of Magnetius to Constantius after the Battle of Mursa Major.\n\nThe existence of this first poem is based on the first verses of the second poem. Here Proba rejects her first Pagan composition, and scholars think that the Pagan poem was destroyed according to her will.\n\nProba's most famous work is a Virgilian centoa patchwork of verses extracted from several works of Virgil, with minimal modificationsentitled \"Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi\" (\"A Virgilian Cento Concerning the Glory of Christ\"). The 694 lines are divided into a proemium with invocation (lines 1-55), episodes from the Old Testament (lines 56-345), episodes from the New Testament (lines 346-688), and an epilogue (lines 689-694).\n\n\n", "id": "7708507", "categories": ["310s births", "Ancient Roman women writers", "4th-century Romans", "Women poets", "4th-century Christians", "Christian poets", "360s deaths", "4th-century women writers", "350s deaths", "4th-century Latin writers", "300s births", "4th-century Roman poets", "Roman-era poets", "4th-century Roman women"], "title": "Faltonia Betitia Proba"}

Institutional membership in the association has grown from 49 colleges and universities when it was founded, to the current 105 institutions. All member institutions have graduate programs in space sciences or technology. Besides the 95 member institutions in the United States, there are two member institutions in Canada, four in Europe, two in Israel, one in Australia and one in Hong Kong.\n\nUSRA provides a mechanism through which universities can cooperate effectively with one another, with the government, and with other organizations to further space science and technology, and to promote education in these areas. Its mission is carried out through the institutes, centers, divisions, and programs. Administrative and scientific personnel now number about 420. A unique feature of USRA's management is its system of standing panels of technical experts, drawn from the research community, to provide oversight for USRA's institutes, centers, divisions and programs.\n\nUSRA's origins extend back to 1966, when the NASA Administrator requested the help of the NAS in forming a national consortium to assume management of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. The president of the NAS, Dr. Frederick Seitz, first turned to the Universities Research Association (URA), which had recently been created to operate the National Accelerator Laboratory. Seitz raised the issue of NASA's involvement at a URA meeting in the fall of 1966. However, because of budgetary concerns with the National Accelerator Laboratory, URA did not wish to assume any additional responsibilities.\n\nTo satisfy its immediate needs, NASA took upon itself the management of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory but left open the possibility of wider participation of the academic community through an institute. At this time, the idea of a Lunar Science Institute (LSI) took form. To develop further the concept of the LSI, the NAS created a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Kenneth Pitzer to study NASA/University Relations. In the fall of 1967, the Pitzer Committee recommended the establishment of the LSI initially to be operated by Rice University under a subcontract with the NAS, but eventually to be operated by a university consortium. The Pitzer committee concluded that the pattern established at LSI could form the basis for the development of a much broader link between NASA and the academic community.\n\nOn March 1, 1968, President Lyndon Johnson announced the creation of the Lunar Science Institute (LSI), and USRA was chartered the following year as the parent organization of LSI. The initial headquarters of USRA was at the University of Virginia, where Professor A. R. Kuhlthau served as the first president of the association.\n\nIn 1976, Dr. Alexander J. Dessler became the second USRA president. Dessler moved the headquarters of the association to Rice University, where he served as chairman of the Department of Space Physics and Astronomy.\n\nIn 1978 USRA headquarters moved to Columbia, Maryland.\n\nDr. David C. Black was appointed USRA president in 2000. Black served as director of USRA's Lunar and Planetary Institute from 1988 to 2001, and is internationally recognized for research in theoretical astrophysics and planetary science.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Isaacson was named president and CEO of USRA, effective October 20, 2014.\n\nUSRA initially concentrated on the management of Lunar Science Institute (later renamed the Lunar and Planetary Institute) but, armed with its broad charter, the consortium began to explore other ways to serve the university space research community as early as 1970. Today, USRA researchers are involved with university, government and industry scientists and engineers in a broad array of space and aeronautics related fields, including astronomy and astrophysics, earth sciences, microgravity, life sciences, space technology, computer science, and advanced concepts.\n\nMost USRA research activities include related educational components.\n\nThe presidents of USRA have been:\n", "id": "7708517", "categories": ["Space agencies", "Space organizations"], "title": "Universities Space Research Association"}

A successor of 19th century French sinologists Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat and Stanislas Julien, Chavannes was largely responsible for the development of Sinology and Chinese scholarship into a respected field in the realm of French science.\n\nÉdouard Chavannes was born on 5 October 1865 in Lyon, France. As a youth he studied at the \"lycée\" in Lyon, where, like most students of his era, his education focused mainly on the Latin and Greek Classics. Chavannes was then sent to Paris to attend the prestigious Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where he and his classmates studied and prepared for the entrance exams to one of the French \"Grandes Écoles\". Chavannes passed his entrance exams and was admitted to the \"Lettres\" (\"literature\") section of the École Normale Supérieure in 1885. Chavannes spent three years at the school, finishing in 1888 after successfully passing his \"agrégation\" in philosophy.\n\nGeorges Perrot, a French archaeologist and newly appointed director of the École Normale Supérieure, advised Chavannes to begin studying China after he finished his schooling. Chavannes first considered studying Chinese philosophy, which was nearer to his own educational background, but on the advice of the French scholar Henri Cordier he ultimately decided to focus on Chinese history, which up to that time had been much less widely studied in the West. Chavannes began attending Classical Chinese courses given by the Marquis d'Hervey-Saint-Denys at the Collège de France and the Mandarin Chinese classes of Maurice Jametel (1856–1889) at the École des Langues Orientales Vivantes (School of Living Oriental Languages). Desiring to advance his studies with actual experience in China, Chavannes used the connections of certain friends of his to obtain a position as an attaché to a scientific mission associated with the French Legation in Peking (modern Beijing). He departed for China in January 1889 and arrived two months later. As a sinologist, Chavannes took the Chinese name \"Sha Wan\" (沙畹) and the courtesy name \"Zilan\" (滋蘭), and he also had an art name \"Shicheng Boshi\" (獅城博士, \"The Doctor of Lyon\").\nIn 1891, Chavannes briefly returned to France where he married Alice Dor, the daughter of a well-known optometrist in Lyon, before returning to China with her. Together they had a son, Fernand Henri Chavannes, who later became a highly decorated flying ace during World War I, and two daughters.\n\nChavannes stayed in China until 1893, when he returned to France to take up the position of Professor of Chinese at the Collège de France, which had been vacated upon the death of the Marquis d'Hervey-Saint-Denys in November 1892. Although Chavannes had only been studying Chinese for five years, the quality and value of his early Chinese scholarship had already been widely recognized in the academic community, and convinced the regents of the Collège de France to give the position to him. Chavannes opened his tenure with a lecture entitled \"Du Rôle social de la littérature chinoise\" (\"On the Social Role of Chinese Literature\"). During his tenure at the Collège, Chavannes was widely active in French academic circles: he was a member of the Institut de France, was an honorary member of a number of foreign societies, served as a French co-editor of the noted sinological journal \"T'oung Pao\" from 1904 until 1916, and was elected President of the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1915.\n\nChavannes's granddaughter Claire Chavannes had a son with physicist Paul Langevin's grandson Bernard Langevin: the french mathematician Remi Langevin.\n\nChavannes' first scholarly publication, \"Le Traité sur les sacrifices Fong et Chan de Se-ma Ts'ien, traduit en français\" (\"Sima Qian's Treatise on the \"Feng\" and \"Shan\" Sacrifices, Translated into French\"), which was published in 1890 while he was in Beijing, inspired him to begin a translation of Sima Qian's \"Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji\" 史記\")\", the first of China's dynastic histories. The first volume of the translation was published in Paris in 1895, and begins with a 249-page introduction which the German anthropologist Berthold Laufer described as \"a masterpiece of historical and critical analysis... not surpassed by anything of this character written before or after him.\" Chavannes produced four additional volumes between 1896 and 1905, covering 47 of the 130 chapters of the \"Records\" and complete with full commentary and indices. His translations also include a large number of appendices covering topics of special interests.\n\nChavannes was major pioneer in the field of modern epigraphy, and was praised by Berthold Laufer as \"the first European scholar who approached this difficult subject with sound and critical methods and undisputed success.\" His first epigraphical article, \"Les Inscriptions des Ts'in\" (\"Qin Inscriptions\"), was published in \"Journal Asiatique\" in 1893, which was followed later by a number of works in which Chavannes was the first Western scholar to successfully analyze and translate the unusual epigraphical style of the Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty. Chavannes returned to China in 1907 to study ancient monuments and inscriptions, taking hundreds of photographs and rubbings that were published in 1909 in a large album entitled \"Mission archéologique dans la Chine septentrionale\" (\"Archaeological Mission to Northern China\"). He published two volumes of translations and analysis of the inscription material before his death: \"La Sculpture à l'époque des Han\" (\"Sculpture in the Han Era\"), published in 1913, and \"La Sculpture bouddhique\" (\"Buddhist Sculpture\"), published in 1915.\n\nChavannes was intrigued by and performed extensive research into the major religions of ancient and medieval China: Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, Daoism, Nestorian Christianity, and Manichaeism. His \"Mémoire composé à l'époque de la grande dynastie T'ang sur les religieux éminents qui allèrent chercher la loi dans les pays d'occident par I-Tsing (Memoir Written in the Grand Tang Dynasty by Yijing on the Religious Men Who Went to Search for the Law in the Western Lands)\", which was published in 1894 and won the \"Prix Julien\", contains translations of the biographies and travelogues of sixty Buddhist monks who journeyed from China to India during the Tang dynasty in search of Buddhist scriptures and Sanskrit books. Chavannes' best-known work on Chinese Buddhism is his three-volume work \"Cinq cents contes et apologues extraits du Tripiṭaka chinois\" (\"Five Hundred Tales and Fables from the Chinese Tripiṭaka\").\n\nChavannes' 1910 book \"Le T'ai Chan, essai de monographie d'un culte chinois (Tai Shan: Monographic Essay on a Chinese Cult)\", is a detailed study of the indigenous Chinese folk religion, which predates Buddhism and religious Daoism, and focuses on an ancient mountain cult centered on Mt. Tai that Chavannes visited personally. This monumental work begins with introductory essays on the generally sacred role of mountains in Chinese history and culture, then examines the personality of Mt. Tai itself in great detail. Chavannes includes translations of dozens of relevant passages from ancient, medieval, and pre-modern Chinese literature, including comments and passages gathered by medieval scholars Zhu Xi and Gu Yanwu. His study also includes eleven translations from rubbings of stone inscriptions Chavannes made himself in temples he visited on and around Mt. Tai, as well as a detailed hand-drawn topographic map of the mountain that Chavannes drew himself. Chavannes' style in \"Le T'ai Chan\", with his annotated translations, extensive commentary, and exhaustively researched sources was inspirational and influential to later French sinologists.\n\nIn 1912, Chavannes and his former student Paul Pelliot edited and translated a Chinese Manichaean treatise that Pelliot had discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the Mogao caves. The book, published in Paris as \"Un traité manichéen retrouvé en Chine (A Manichaean Treatise Found in China)\", was praised by Berthold Laufer upon Chavannes' death in 1918 as \"perhaps the most brilliant achievement in modern sinology.\"\n\n\n", "id": "7708605", "categories": ["École Normale Supérieure alumni", "French sinologists", "1865 births", "Members of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres", "Collège de France faculty", "1918 deaths"], "title": "Édouard Chavannes"}

A re-recorded version of the song would later appear on the band's 1986 album \"Human Frailty\". Written by bass guitarist John Archer, keyboardist Geoffrey Crosby, drummer Douglas Falconer, trumpet player Jack Howard, recorder/mixing engineer Robert Miles, vocalist/lead guitarist Mark Seymour and trombone player Michael Waters. The song captures the intensity of sensual love at the same time portraying its fleeting nature with lyrics including \"\"And we may never meet again, So shed your skin and let's get started\"\".\n\nHunters & Collectors had formed in 1981 with Mark Seymour (guitar, vocals), John Archer (bass guitar), Doug Falconer (drums) Geoff Crosby (keyboards), Greg Perano (percussion), Ray Tosti-Guerra (guitar), and Robert Miles, their sound engineer and art director. Miles was credited as an equal part of the band's output and stayed with the band throughout their career. Tosti-Guerra was later replaced by Martin Lubran, then by Barry Palmer. Seymour is the older brother of bassist Nick Seymour of Crowded House. Hunters & Collectors signed to White Label, an offshoot of Mushroom Records, and by 1985 the line-up was Seymour, Archer, Falconer, Crosby and Miles with Jack Howard on trumpet and Michael Waters on trombone. They recorded the first version of \"Throw Your Arms Around Me\" for a single-only release in 1984, with \"Unbeliever\" as its B-side; all members were credited as the songs' writers. A live version of \"Throw Your Arms Around Me\" appeared on their 1985 album \"The Way to Go Out\". Their breakthrough commercial success in Australia came in 1986, with the release of the album \"Human Frailty\", which featured another recording of the single \"Throw Your Arms Around Me\", as well as \"Say Goodbye\" and \"Everything's on Fire\". In 1990 a slower, more acoustically introspective version of the single was recorded and released from their compilation album \"Collected Works\". The promotional video was a mosaic of all their previous videos. \n\nMark Seymour described writing for \"Human Frailty\":\nA shortened version was performed by Crowded House (a band whose members include Mark Seymour's brother Nick) at their Farewell To The World concert in 1996, and was also earlier covered by the band on MTV Unplugged. \n\nThe song has also been covered by Australian musical comedy act, Tripod, famous for their work on the Triple J radio Australian network. The song was later covered by Pearl Jam, with the lyric \"\"I will kiss you in four places\"\" changed to \"\"I will kiss you in 155 places\"\" by vocalist Eddie Vedder. Neil Finn attributes this change to Vedder's having heard one of Crowded House's many cover versions of the song before hearing the original.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7708624", "text": "Little Switzerland (landscape)\n\nA little Switzerland or Schweiz is a landscape, often of wooded hills. This Romantic aesthetic term is not a geographic category, but was widely used in the 19th century to connote dramatic natural scenic features that would be of interest to tourists. Since it was ambiguous from the very beginning, it was flexibly used in travel writing to imply that a landscape had some features, though on a much smaller scale, that might remind a visitor of Switzerland.\n\nThe original generic term was applied to dozens of locations in Europe, the bulk of them German-speaking, as well as to other parts of the world, to direct attention to rock outcrops that stand out, usually amid steep forest. The original, 18th-century comparison was usually with the fissured crags of the Jura Mountains on the Franco-Swiss border which hardly rise higher than 1700 metres. \n\nHistories of Saxon Switzerland (\"Sächsische Schweiz\") in Saxony, Germany, assert that the landscape description \"schweiz\" arose there at the end of the 18th century. \"Schweiz\" is the German-language name of Switzerland. The term was used both alone and with the prefix \"little\", for example in the title of an 1820 German book-length poem, \"Die kleine Schweiz\" by Jakob Reiselsberger, which praised the rocky scenery of a part of Franconia in Germany known thereafter as the Franconian Switzerland (\"Fränkische Schweiz\").\n\nThe term was already colloquial by this time in English: in 1823 a correspondent asserted in \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" that a steep area by the road outside Petersfield in southern England was a little Switzerland. The aesthetic term, to describe picturesque exposed rock and steepness rather than altitude, was also in common use in other European languages, including the French term \"Suisse\". Rocks and wild landscapes were a favoured theme in Romantic painting.\n\nThe many English places praised in 19th-century promotional literature as \"little Switzerland\" include Church Stretton, Whitfield and the coastal area around the North Devon twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth. Chalet-style buildings were sometimes erected to emphasize little Switzerland pretensions, for example at Matlock Bath, which (unusually for England) also features a cable car.\n\nFrom the beginning, the term was often understood as a comparison to the snow-capped Alps rather than to the Jura. The following passage, describing Wales, appears in an 1831 English-language edition of Malte-Brun's \"Universal Geography\", which had originally been written in French in 1803–07: \n\nDescribing the Atlantic island of St Helena in \"A New Voyage Round the World\" (1823–26), Otto von Kotzebue and Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz were translated into English as writing: \n\nIn the United States, the raw White Mountains of New Hampshire, which were soon to be one of the definitive subjects of American Romantic painting, were termed a little Switzerland by travel writer Henry Tudor as early as 1832.\n\nIn the later 19th century, authors and tourism promoters would praise picture-postcard summer scenery of woods and low hills reflected in blue lakes as a little Switzerland or \"schweiz\". Whereas the earlier use had implied a landscape of dangers, this was a term for beauty. \n\nThis usage, reflected today in the official geographical terms for the Holstein Switzerland (\"Holsteinische Schweiz\") and Mecklenburg Switzerland (\"Mecklenburgische Schweiz\") in Germany, where there are neither mountains nor outcrops, is difficult to account for, but may refer to prestigious Swiss lakeside tourist destinations such as Zurich, Lucerne or Interlaken or to Lakes Geneva and Constance.\n\nThe term has often appeared anachronistic since travel to Switzerland became affordable. By the 21st century, it was common for observers to express puzzlement that the \"little Switzerland\" label applied at all to regions such as the Suisse Normande, or to the Holstein Switzerland where the flat hilltops are no more than 150 metres above the lake surfaces.\n\nIn 1992, the Swiss Tourism Federation counted more than 190 places round the world that had at least for some period been named after Switzerland, either because of a fancied scenic resemblance, in jest or referring to a banking haven, political neutrality or habitation by Swiss emigrants. No fewer than 67 places in neighbouring Germany were said by the Federation to have adopted little Switzerland names. \n\nWhile the byname has fallen out of fashion in some places, it persists as the official geographical name for several administrative regions and national parks including (with dates of legal designation):\n\nBusiness promotion regions using the name without legally defined boundaries include:\n\nNotable privately developed properties known by the name include:\n\nIn English, \"Little Switzerland\" is usually said without any definite article or additional adjective, but often with a genitive modifier if there are several little Switzerlands within one nation, e.g. North Carolina's Little Switzerland. In European languages where Switzerland proper takes a definite article, little Switzerlands do likewise. Their English names may echo the vernacular, being capitalized and modified to the English alphabet, sometimes taking an English definite article, e.g. the Saechsische Schweiz (\"die Sächsische Schweiz\") and the Suisse Normande (\"la Suisse normande\"). English forms are also widespread, e.g. Holstein Switzerland (Dickinson, 1964), Swiss Franconia (Michelin, 1993), Franconian Switzerland (Fodor, 1962, and Bolt, 2005.)\n\n", "id": "7708624", "categories": ["Romantic art", "Landscape art by type", "Romanticism"], "title": "Little Switzerland (landscape)"}

This battle is sometimes confused with the later Battle of Rovine (lit. \"Battle of the Marshes\", Rovine is old Romanian-Latin for ruins, modern Italian rovinare to tear down) between the same combatants, and which took place also along the valley of the Argeş River.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire emerged as a small principality in the early fourteenth century in the northwestern part of the Anatolian Peninsula. In the following decades, the Ottoman Sultans combined their growing military strength with astute dynastic politics to expand their territory eastwards into the whole of Anatolia and westwards into the Balkan Peninsula. Thus, in 1387 Murad I (1362–89) conquered much of Greece and fought a large Christian army at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. In the early 1390s his successor Bayezid I (1389–1402) established his suzerainty over Stefan Lazarević of Serbia, the Turnovo Bulgaria of Ivan Shishman and the Vidin Despotate of Ivan Sratsimir. The Ottoman Empire had become one of the most important powers in the Balkans, threatening the remaining independent states of central Europe: Wallachia, Moldavia, the Kingdom of Hungary, as well as the Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea. Mircea of Wallachia previously secured an alliance with several Karamanid princes of Anatolia, which antagonized Bayezid I. Yet Bayezid despite defeating the Karamanids, had to plan and act every action carefully, since he had more enemies than friends among the Muslim Turkish aristocracy, and could not simply turn around and declare a new \"holy war\" against those whose troops helped the Karamanid princes in Anatolia. His opportunity came when the Wallachians and the Hungarians invaded the weak states from the south of the Danube, which were vassals of Bayezid. The Wallachians occupied the Principality of Karvuna and the city of Silistra apparently with the consent of Ivan Shishman, while the Hungarians tried to conquer the Vidin Despotate. These infringements on his vassals' lands gave Bayezid authority to move.\n\nReturning from Asia Minor to the Balkans in 1393, the Sultan expelled the Wallachians from Silistra and the Dobruja, and declared that Turnovo Tsardom, unable to fend for herself, was now an Ottoman pashalik. The final attack on Wallachia was to take place.\n\nIn the autumn of 1394, after a raiding campaign along the right bank of the Danube, Bayezid launched the attack on Wallachia. He commanded the Ottoman Rumelian army, and the armies of his Balkan vassals, most of which were Bulgarians and Serbs under Stefan Lazarević, the son of the late Serbian prince Lazar. The armies crossed the Danube at Nicopolis, at advanced along the Argeş River with the intention of capturing Curtea de Argeş, the capital city of Wallachia. After a weeklong march in which the constant attacks Wallachian took their toll, the Wallachian army met the Ottoman one on October 10. The Wallachians launched a sudden ambush from the forests, slowly pushing the Ottomans closely to the bank of the Argeş River. The bloodiest fighting took place around the Ottoman camp, strengthened with earth walls, palisades and ditches (hendek in Turkish). Hence, the name with which this battle appears in Serbian chronicles, as the Battle of the Trenches (of Karanovasa). Surrounded, the Ottomans managed to resist until the dawn, when Bayiezid hardly managed to escape the battle, fleeing over the Danube Nevertheless, most of his and his vassals’ armies perished.\n\nIt would turn out that his vassals suffered more from the Sultans \"help\" than they did from the Wallachians and Hungarians. The Turnovo Tsardom not only ceased its existence, but Ivan Shishman was accused of collaboration with the enemy and was executed at the orders of the Sultan. Bayezid spent the winter and the spring warring in Anatolia with Seljuk princes, besieging Constantinople, and leaving the lands south of the Danube in the hands of Mircea, who by now managed to provoke an anti-Ottoman rebellion as far south as Rumelia.\n\nA much better prepared attack, in which the entire Ottoman army, as well as the whole of the Ottoman vassals took part, was started by the Sultan in spring, in May 1395. The alliance documents signed at Brașov on March 7, between Mircea and Sigismund of Luxembourg, reveal that by 1395, a huge concentration of Ottoman forces took place in the southern Dobruja. The Ottoman army launched a two-directional attack via Nicopolis, and via Vidin-Craiova. Another Ottoman army group, led by Vlad I of Wallachia, Mircea's nephew, who was attempting to take the throne with Turkish support, was invading along the Ialomiţa River. Faced with a much larger force, Mircea applied guerrilla tactics, and delayed direct confrontation with the Ottoman army until he received help from his ally Sigismund. The final confrontation would take place at the Battle of Rovine (lit. \"Battle of the Marshes\").\n\n", "id": "7708630", "categories": ["Battles involving the Ottoman Empire", "1394 in Europe", "Battles involving Wallachia", "14th century in Serbia", "Conflicts in 1394", "Battles involving Serbia"], "title": "Battle of Karanovasa"}

Working with a community of writers in Amherst, Massachusetts, she explored ways to conduct a writing class/workshop that would honor the \"primary voice,\" encouraging students to trust what the writer John Edgar Wideman has called \"the language of home.\" She further cites the writer Paule Marshall who has written: \"When people at readings and writers' conferences ask me who my major influences were... I always acknowledge before all others: the group of women around the table long ago. They taught me my first lessons in the narrative art. They trained my ear. They set a standard of excellence. This is why the best of my work must be attributed to them; it stands as testimony to the rich legacy of language and culture they so freely passed on to me in the wordshop of the kitchen.\"\n\nIn 1985, Schneider offered workshops to women living in public housing in Chicopee, Massachusetts. \"On Sunday nights for the past eight years, the Chicopee Writing Workshop has been changing lives. ...'The most important change,' Pat says, 'is the way the women see themselves.'\" Schneider chose to develop the workshop for women in public housing because she believes \"there is no difference between the rich and the poor in this: writing is art, and our own stories are the stuff of which our freedom is made, our self esteem, our power.\"\n\nIn 1990 Schneider's workshops \"became so popular... [Schneider] had to encourage some of her students to break away and start their own groups using her techniques. Beginning in 2004 Schneider began training other writers to become workshop leaders. Over 1000 writers are now recognized as AWA-certified workshop leaders who have led workshops in the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Workshops are built around a set of essential affirmations and practices.\n\n\n", "id": "7708670", "categories": ["University of Massachusetts Amherst alumni", "Pacific School of Religion alumni", "Writers from Missouri", "Living people", "American women poets", "1934 births", "People from Ava, Missouri"], "title": "Pat Schneider"}

It is managed by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. It covers in McCormick County and Edgefield County, and was established to protect rare animal and plant species. Webster's Salamander and Miccosukee gooseberry are among the species which have few populations outside the preserve. The nearest population center is Clarks Hill, about two road miles (3–4 km) to the southwest.\n\nThe site was identified in 1957 by Albert E. Radford of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He noticed exceptional diversity in the tree, shrub and herb layers on the bluffs overlooking Steven's Creek, and documented six plant species which had been unknown in South Carolina up to that time. Another five species were known from only one other South Carolina location. Many of these rare species were plentiful at the site, and remain prominent there today. A remarkable feature of this plant community is that a palmetto, \"Sabal minor\", occurs near northern inland wildflowers such as \"Asarum canadense\". Four trillium species are also present.\n\nSoils of the bluffs were found to be atypical for South Carolina. Most of the state's soils are acidic with pH near or below 5. However, some topsoils in the preserve had pH readings near 7 -- neutral on the scale. This is more typical of base-rich sites in Appalachian coves and the Midwest, where many plants rare to South Carolina are abundant. These soils correspond most closely to the Cartecay and Toccoa series which are loam or sandy loam-textured Entisols. Along Steven's Creek are alluvial silt loam Inceptisols of the Riverview series. The majority of the preserve, away from the bluffs, is underlain by acidic sandy loam Ultisols of the Cataula, Hiwassee, Louisburg, and Pacolet series typical of the South Carolina Piedmont. These upland soils support mixed pine and hardwood forest over most of the preserve except in the southwest corner which has pure stands of pine.\n\n", "id": "7708680", "categories": ["Nature reserves in South Carolina", "Protected areas of McCormick County, South Carolina"], "title": "Steven's Creek Heritage Preserve"}

It is composed of a flour tortilla filled with seasoned ground beef taco meat (with options to substitute steak or chicken), beans, diced onions, cheddar cheese, and \"red sauce\".\n\nThere is an unsubstantiated claim that the Enchirito was invented in 1967 by a high school student in Montebello, CA.\n\nHowever, a 2008 article published in the Long Beach Press-Telegram claimed that a Cerritos, California based franchise owner named Dan Jones had created the Enchirito.\n\nIn an article published in a Corsicana Daily Sun in 1971, there is a third claim that a Taco Bell franchise owner in Texas was the actual inventor.\n\nThe original Enchirito of the 1970s was advertised as a \"special tortilla\" filled with ground beef, pinto beans, and onions; topped with red sauce, cheese and olives. It was served in a reheatable aluminum foil tray. One of the earliest print reference to the Enchirito is an August 1967 Taco Bell ad in an Amarillo, Texas newspaper for a meal consisting of a taco, Enchirito, and soft drink for $0.89.\n\nTaco Bell registered the name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a service mark in May 1970. In its application, Taco Bell described the item as a \"[ Combination Enchilada And Burrito Prepared As Part Of ] Restaurant Services\" and that \"\"Enchirito\" Is Merely A Fanciful Combination Of \"Enchilada\" And \"Burrito.\"\"\n\nThe coining of the name Enchirito (a portmanteau of the words enchilada and burrito) for this item was a bit of a peculiar action by Taco Bell. It was the only item on the menu, at the time, to not use the common Mexican food nomenclature for that item. Whereas a burrito is typically a flour tortilla filled with beans, and an enchilada is typically a corn tortilla filled with meat and smothered in chile sauce, the name Enchirito communicates the combination of these elements. On the other hand, it appears the unusual name was not to help Americans unfamiliar with the Spanish names of the food items; indeed, for many years Taco Bell menu boards featured a system of phonetic pronunciation guides next to each item.\n\nEven after the Enchirito was officially discontinued in 1993, some customers still ordered them, and word spread through the Internet that many restaurants would still make them with the ingredients they had available. Due to this underground popularity, it was decided to bring it back, and commercials, featuring the Taco Bell chihuahua promoting the Enchirito, began airing on December 26, 1999, with later commercials in mid-2000 featuring the rapping or singing styles of the \"five guys with no talent\". However, some things about the item had changed. The serving container had become a coated pressed-paper oblong bowl when dining in, or a black plastic bowl with a clear plastic lid if ordering from the drive-thru. Most significantly, the character of the dish was altered by changing the yellow corn masa tortilla to a white wheat flour tortilla. The sliced olives were omitted. The chicken Enchirito and the steak Enchirito, which respectively substitute chicken or steak for the ground beef, were also introduced as options. The Enchirito is served with a plastic spork.\nThe Enchirito was once again discontinued when Taco Bell introduced the Smothered Burrito on July 25, 2013. While it may not be currently seen on the menu, it can be requested when ordering.\n\nA typical ground beef enchirito contains 209 calories, 17 grams of fat (8 grams saturated), 45 milligrams cholesterol, and 1110 milligrams of sodium.\n\n", "id": "7708681", "categories": ["Taco Bell"], "title": "Enchirito"}

Constructed in the Kerala style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the \"Divya Prabandha\", the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 \"Divyadesam\" dedicated to Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, who is worshipped as Parthasarathy (Partha's charioteer). The nearest railway station to the temple is located in Chengannur, while the nearest airport is Trivandrum International Airport.\n\nParthasarathy is the other name of Krishna on account of his role as Arjuna's Charioteer in the Mahabharata war. It is one of the most important Krishna temples in Kerala, the others being at Guruvayur Temple, Trichambaram Temple, Tiruvarppu and Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple. It is one of the five ancient shrines in the Chengannur area of Kerala, connected with the legend of Mahabharata, where the five Pandavas are believed to have built one temple each; Thrichittatt Maha Vishnu Temple by Yudhishthira, Puliyur Mahavishnu Temple by Bheema, Aranmula by Arjuna, Thiruvanvandoor Mahavishnu Temple by Nakula and Thrikodithanam Mahavishnu Temple to Sahadeva.\n\nThe sacred jewels, called \"Thiruvabharanam\" of Ayyappan are taken in procession to Sabarimala each year from Pandalam, and Aranmula Temple is one of the stops on the way. Also, the \"Thanka Anki\", golden attire of Ayyappa, donated by the king of Travancore, is stored here and taken to Sabarimala during the Mandala season of late December. Aranmula is also known for snake boat race held every year during Onam linked to the legends of the Mahabharata. The temple has four towers over its entrances on its outer wall. The Eastern tower is accessed through a flight of 18 steps and the Northern tower entrance flight through 57 steps leads to the Pampa River. It is believed that Dushasana is the guardian of the eastern Gopuram of the temple. The temples has paintings on its walls dating back to early 18 century.\n\nThe temple is open from 4 am to 11:00 am and 5 pm to 8 pm and is administered by Travancore Devaswom Board of the Government of Kerala.\n\nIt is one of the five ancient shrines in the Chengannur area of Kerala, connected with the legend of Mahabharata. Legend has it that the Pandava princes, after crowning Parikshit as king of Hastinapura left on a pilgrimage. On arriving on the banks of river Pamba, each one is believed to have installed a tutelary image of Krishna; Thrichittatt Maha Vishnu Temple by Yudhishthira, Puliyur Mahavishnu Temple by Bheema, Aranmula by Arjuna, Thiruvanvandoor Mahavishnu Temple by Nakula and Thrikodithanam Mahavishnu Temple to Sahadeva.\n\nThe image of the temple was brought here in a raft made of six pieces of bamboo to this site, and hence the name Aranmula (six pieces of bamboo). As per other legend, the place derives its name from \"arin-villai\", a land near a river. Legend has it that Arjuna built this temple, to expiate for the sin of having killed Karna on the battlefield, against the dharma of killing an unarmed enemy. It is also believed that Vishnu (here) revealed the knowledge of creation to Brahma, from whom the Madhukaitapa demons stole the Vedas.\n\nThere is yet another legend associated with Parthasarathy here. During the battle of Kurukshetra, Duryodhana had taunted Bheeshma of not using his full might in fighting the Pandavas. This taunt by Duryodhana filled Bheeshma with rage. Bheeshma took a vow to fight with such ferocity the next day that Lord Krishna himself would be forced to break his vow of not using a weapon during the war in order to protect Arjuna. On the ninth day of the battle of Kurukshetra, the Kauravas reigned supreme under the leadership of Bheeshma, when Krishna motivated Arjuna to take initiative and vanquish his foe. Bheeshma was unparalleled with the use of celestial weapons in such a manner that Arjuna could not counter the onslaught. Arrows after arrows fired from Bheeshma's bow breached the defenses of Arjuna and inflicted wounds to his body by penetrating his armour. The string of Arjuna's bow, the Gandiva was snapped during the battle. Seeing Arjuna's plight, Krishna jumped down in rage, and took up his discus charging towards Bheeshma. Bheeshma was overfilled with joy and surrendered to Lord Krishna. Meanwhile, Arjuna beseeched the Lord not to kill Bheeshma, as it would have been against Krishna's vow to take up arms in his battle. It is believed that it is this image of Krishna that is enshrined here, with a discus. This symbolizes the Lord's act of compassion to both his devotees on either side of the battle. Lord Krishna broke his vow to protect Arjuna and also to fulfill the promise that his ardent devotee Bheeshma had made.\n\nLord Krishna presiding here in the Vishvarupa form is considered as 'Annadana Prabhu' (The Lord who provides food) along with other temples like Vaikom Mahadeva Temple and Sabarimala. It is believed that those whose Annaprashana is performed at the Aranmula Parthasarathy temple would never be affected by the pangs of poverty throughout their life.\n\nAranmula Mirror is also related to the history of this temple. The king of Travancore wanted to donate a crown made of rare metal to the temple and he found a rare combination of Copper and lead. It is believed as per the tradition that preparing the metal polished mirror was produced only by a family. In modern times, the College of Fine Arts have started producing it in commercial scale.\n\nThe temple is built in Kerala style architecture, which is common in all temples in the South Indian state of Kerala in Eastern axis. The temple has an elevated structure reached by a flight of 20 steps. The temple has a two storeyed gopuram or a gateway tower, with the upper storey having wooden trails covering the \"Kottupura\" (a hall of drum beating during festivals). A rectangular wall around the temple, called \"Kshetra-Madilluka\" piereced by the gateways, encloses all the shrines of the temple. The metal plated flagpost or \"Dwajasthambam\" is located axial to the temple tower leading to the central sanctum and there is a \"Deepastamba\", which is the light post. \"Chuttuambalam\" is the outer pavilion within the temple walls. The central shrine and the associated hall is located in a rectangular structure called \"Nallambalam\", which has pillared halls and corridors. Between the entrance of \"Nallambalam\" to the sanctum, there is a raised square platform called \"Namaskara Mandapa\" which has a pyramidal roof. \"Thevrapura\", the kitchen used to cook offering to the deity is located on the left of \"Namaskara Mandapa\" from the entrance. \"Balithara\" is an altar is used for making ritualistic offering to demi-gods and the festive deities. The central shrine called \"Sreekovil\" houses the image of the presiding deity. It is on an elevated platform with a single door reached through a flight of five steps. Either sides of the doors have images of guardian deities called Dvarapalakas. As per Kerala rituals, only the main priest called Thantri and the second priest called Melshanthi alone can enter the \"Sree Kovil\". The central shrine has a circular plan with the base built of granite, superstructure built of laterite and conical roof made of terrocata tile supported from inside by a wooden structure. The lower half of \"Sree Kovil\" consists of the basement, the pillar or the wall, called \"stambha\" or \"bhithi\" and the entablature called \"prasthara\" in the ratio 1:2:1, in height. Similarly the upper half is divided into the neck called \"griva\", the roof tower called \"shikhara\" and the conial \"kalasam\" (made of copper) in the same ratio. The roof projects in two levels to protect the inner structure from heavy rains during monsoon. The roof of the temple and some of the pillars have lavish wood and stucco carvings depicting various stories of ancient epics, Ramayana and Mahabharatha. The outer walls around the sanctum have a series of wooden frames housing an array of lamps, which are lit during festive occasions. The temples have paintings on its walls dating back to early 18 century. The image of the presiding deity is tall. Krishna is in Vishvarupa pose, the one he depicted to Arjuna during the Mahabharatha war. As per one legend, Arjuna is believed to have built the temple in Nilakal Narayanapuram and later brought to Aranmula in a raft made with six bamboo. In the second precicnt, there are shrines of Sastha, Yakshi, Nagaraja and Erangavil Bhagavathy Balarama in the lower shrine.\n\nThe annual Utsavam commences on the Atham Nakshatra in the month of Makara and concludes ten days later on the Thiruvonam day.\nGaruda Vahanam Ezhunellippu is the main event during this ten day festival. This event falls on the fifth day of the annual festival and is also called \"Anchaam Purappadu\". The deity is taken out from the sanctum sanctorum mounted on Garuda. It is believed that all 33 million Gods and Demi-Gods would be present in the temple at that time to witness Lord Krishna riding on his vahana, the Garuda.\n\nAs per Hindu legend in Mahabharata, Arjuna, one of the Pandavas was returning with the image of Krishna after along penance. He faced a huge flood in the Pamba river. A poor low caste Hindu helped him cross the river with a raft made with six bamboos. It is believed that the Aranmula Boat Race is celebrated annually on the Pamba river to commemorate the poor Hindu. The race is held on the last day of the Onam festival when snake boats around with four helmsmen, 100 rowers and 25 singers participate. The boats move in pairs to the rhythm of music. After the watersport, there is an elaborate feast in the Aranmula temple. The festival is the largest boat race festival held in Kerala and is attended by thousands of visitors. The festival was largely a religious one until 1978, when the Government of Kerala declared it a sports event, but during 2000, the religious festivities were restored.\n\nThe Malayalam month of Meenam witnesses a festival where Aranmula Parthasarathy is taken in a grand procession on the Garuda mount to the Pampa river bank, where an image of the Bhagawati from the nearby Punnamthode temple is brought in procession for the \"Arattu\" festival.\n\nAnother festival celebrated here is the Khandavanadahanam celebrated in the Malayalam month of Dhanus. For this festival, a replica of a forest is created in front of the temple with dried plants, leaves and twigs. This bonfire is lit, symbolic of the Khandavana forest fire of the Mahabharata.\n\nThe heads of three Brahmin households in Aranmula and nearby Nedumprayar follow a tradition of fasting on Thiruvonam. The tradition reportedly dates back to more than two centuries. It is believed that once a Brahmin made a vow to feed one pilgrim everyday. Pleased with his devotion, the presiding deity appeared to him. From then on, the Brahmin was overjoyed and he made it a custom to feed to conduct a feast every year, which is practised in modern times. The feast is conducted after the boat race.\n\nThe temple is open from 4 am to 11:00 am and 5 pm to 8 pm and is administered by Travancore Devaswom Board of the Government of Kerala. The king of Travancore maintained the golden dress in the temple, offered to Sabarimala Ayyapan Temple. The practise of offering the golden dress to Sabarimala temple annually is done by the board.\n\n", "id": "7708687", "categories": ["Divya Desams", "Hindu temples in Pathanamthitta district"], "title": "Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple"}

The company evolved from The Greyhound Corporation, which established Greyhound Lines and later became a diversified conglomerate between the 1960s and the 1990s.\n\nViad Corp was founded in 1926 as Motor Transit Corporation after intercity bus operators Eric Wickman and Orville Caesar joined forces and consolidated several bus operations. By 1930, more than 100 bus lines had been consolidated and recognizing the need for a more memorable name, the company was renamed The Greyhound Corporation. The Greyhound name had its origins in the inaugural run of a bus route from Superior, Wisconsin, to Wausau, Wisconsin. While passing through a small town, Ed Stone, the route's operator, saw the reflection of his bus in a store window. The reflection reminded him of a greyhound and he adopted that name for that segment of the Blue Goose Lines. The Greyhound name became popular and was applied to the entire bus network as well as the parent company.\n\nWickman retired as president of Greyhound in 1946 and was succeeded by Caesar. Wickman died at the age of 66 in 1954. Caesar died on May 19, 1965, a day before his 75th birthday.\n\nIn 1954, Greyhound established Greyhound Financial Corporation, the captive finance operation of the Greyhound bus line. During the 1960s, Greyhound began its transformation into conglomerate by diversifying to other industries – financial services (Travelers Express), food and consumer products (Armour and Company), foodservice (Prophet Company), restaurants (Horne's), airport services (Aircraft Services International), cruise line (Premier Cruise Line).\n\nGreyhound exited the transportation industry with the sale of Greyhound Lines in 1987. By then, The Dial Corporation (formerly, Armour-Dial, Inc., established in 1967 as a subsidiary of Armour and Company) was its largest subsidiary. Greyhound was renamed Greyhound Dial Corporation in 1990 and as The Dial Corp the following year. After the renaming, the Dial consumer business became known as The Dial Corp Consumer Products Group.\n\nThe company exited the financial services industry in 1992 with the sale of GFC Financial Corporation (including Greyhound Financial Corporation, Greyhound European Financial Group and Verex Corporation). In 1995, GFC Financial Corporation changed its name to The FINOVA Group, Inc. and Greyhound Financial Corporation to FINOVA Capital Corporation. The FINOVA Group filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and was dissolved in 2009.\n\nIn 1996, the company announced the splitting of its businesses into two entities. The Dial consumer products business was spun-off as the new Dial Corporation. \n\nAfter the split, the company was renamed Viad Corp and consisted of companies involved in airline catering (Dobbs International Service); airplane fueling and ground-handling (Aircraft Service International); convention and exhibit services (GES Exposition Services and Exhibitgroup/Giltspur); concession operations (Glacier Park, Inc.); contract foodservices (Restaura, Inc.); cruise ship (Premier Cruise Lines); airport and cruise ship duty-free concessions (Greyhound Leisure Services); travel services (Brewster Transport, Jetsave, and Crystal Holidays); and payment services (Travelers Express). \n\nBy early 21st century, most of the businesses were sold except for payment services (Travelers Express), travel and recreation (Glacier Park, Inc.) and convention and event services (GES Exposition Services and Exhibitgroup/Giltspur). \n\nIn 2003, Viad began the process of engineering a reverse tax-free spinoff of Travelers Express. Thus, a new subsidiary was formed, MoneyGram International, Inc., which early in 2004 received the payment services business and its stock was distributed to Viad stockholders. Viad then conducted a one-for-four reverse stock split to increase the price of Viad shares.\n\nViad Corp currently consists of two business units: GES (an international live-event organizer) and Pursuit (travel attractions and hotels). \n\n\n\nProperties that Pursuit operates under its Glacier Park Collection (formerly, Glacier Park Inc.) include: \n\nBetween 1981 and 2013, Glacier Park Inc. was also the concessionaire for Lake McDonald Lodge, Apgar Village Inn, Rising Sun Auto Camp, Swiftcurrent Inn, Many Glacier Hotel, Two Medicine Camp Store, and the red bus tours within Glacier National Park. The National Park Service awarded this concession to competitor Xanterra starting in 2014. Glacier Park Inc. said the concessions contract accounted for about 40 percent of its business in the Waterton-Glacier area.\n\nIn 2012, Pursuit acquired the 162-room Banff International Hotel in the heart of the Banff townsite. Pursuit also operates other Banff and Jasper area attractions under the Brewster Travel Canada brand, including Banff’s 135-room Mount Royal Hotel, Jasper's 32-room Glacier View Inn, Banff Lake Cruises and the Banff Gondola.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7708721", "text": "APO Hiking Society\n\nThe Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society, later popularly known as APO Hiking Society, or simply APO, was a Filipino musical group. The group had its fledgling beginnings in 1969 at the Ateneo de Manila high school, with 15 members: John Paul Micayabas, Lito de Joya, Sonny Santiago, Gus Cosio, Renato Garcia, Chito Kintanar, Kenny Barton, Bruce Brown, Butch Dans, Kinjo Sawada, Ric Segreto, Goff Macaraeg, Doden Besa, Jim Paredes, and Boboy Garovillo. The group's name was created from the acronym AMHS representing their school with a witty twist having an irreverent reference to the paralyzed Philippine revolutionary intellectual and hero, Apolinario Mabini, and later shortened to \"Apo\", an Ilocano term for a wise man or a Tagalog term of grandchildren, and later re-branded to \"APO\" (all caps). Contrary to popular belief, the \"Apo\" name was not a reference to the Philippines's highest peak, the potentially-active stratovolcano Mount Apo.\n\nAs the students advanced into college, Danny Javier joined the group. After graduation, the majority of its members left to pursue individual careers, with only three members remaining, made up of Jim Paredes, Boboy Garovillo and Danny Javier.\n\nIn the span of their professional career, Apo emerged as a principal adherent of the musical movement termed Original Pilipino Music (a.k.a. OPM), a milieu in which their original musical contributions and cultural influence became essential. The Apo became involved in record production, talent management and organizing artists under the \"Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit\" (O.P.M., ). The group expanded its activities into establishing and furthering the careers of new OPM artists in the Philippines.\n\nTo date, the group has released 27 albums in four decades of its career. Two hugely successful tribute albums were produced in 2006 and 2007 by its management group, featuring numerous young bands freshly reinterpreting Apo's expansive repertoire.\n\nThe group frequently utilized their brand name, \"Apo,\" as a clever component for Tagalog puns in titles for television shows, live programs and marketing materials, for example, as in \"nA PO,\" which transliterates as \"\"already\"\" (polite/formal usage), and also as \"apó\" (meaning, \"grandchild\"). The puns have been minimally extended into English, as in (APOcalyptic). \n\nThe Name \"Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society\" was meant to be deliberately ironic since the historical figure, Apolinario Mabini, famously lost the use of his legs to polio.\n\nThe Apo Hiking Society first gained recognition in 1973 when they gave a farewell concert at the Meralco Theater in Pasig City, Metro Manila, Philippines. Just out of college, the group was the talk of the Ateneo de Manila University and adjoining campuses for their music and humor.\n\nIt was only when two of its four members were about to retire from the field of amateur music, however, that the APO, then known as the Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society, finally had a citywide audience. One of them was scheduled to leave for Turkey as an exchange student. The other had a position waiting for him in his father's advertising firm.\n\nThe trip to Turkey did not materialize and the APO, now a tentative trio, pushed on steadily towards fame and fortune.\n\nIn late 1978, APO Hiking Society nearly disbanded after Jim Paredes stormed out a songwriting session. While asking Danny Javier for a 3 syllable word to fill in a line, he was provided the word \"katapusan\"; a 4 syllable word. The error went unnoticed until post recording where an irate Paredes noticed that the word had indeed one extra syllable more than what he had originally intended.\n\nLooking back, the APO members Danny Javier and Boboy Garrovillo do not regret never having been regular wage earners. Their farewell concert, which had SRO audiences for two stormy nights, not unexpectedly became a hit record the following year.\n\nIn the three decades since that \"farewell\" concert, the APO has made 22 record albums; hosted several television shows including their own noontime Sunday show \"Sa Linggo nAPO Sila\" and noontime show from Monday to Saturday \"'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila\"; and launched hugely successful major solo concerts and countless provincial, dinner, and corporate shows. They have performed in over 50 cities in the United States, in Canada, Singapore, Indonesia, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Japan to bring Original Pilipino Music to Filipinos the world over.\n\nIn 1978, APO won 2nd Place winner in the Metro Manila Popular Song Festival (now MetroPop Song Festival in 1996 to 2003) for their runner-up song \"Ewan\", the song was composed by Louie Ocampo.\n\nIn October 1987, during their annual US tour, the APO became the first Filipino pop artists with Marco Sison to perform at the Main Hall of New York's prestigious Carnegie Hall. They also performed at the equally prestigious Massey Hall in Toronto, Canada's music capital. Both concerts, as well as the other shows held during that particular concert tour, were sold out. The APO were also the first Filipino artists to perform in a public concert in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 1987, they were one of the first Filipino artists to be recorded on compact disc. And in 1994, they were awarded the first Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino by Awit Awards - the Filipino equivalent of the Grammy. They have also been conferred the Tanglaw Ng Lahi Award, the highest accolade given by Jesuits in the field of culture and arts.\n\nThe APO also earned international recognition for \"Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo\" was recorded by 15 Filipino artists in April 1986. A few months later, the English version \"A New and Better Way\" was launched in Australia. In February 1987, the first anniversary of the Philippines' People Power revolution, the song was released in London, England.

W. Norton & Company. It focuses on American football.\n\nThe book features two dominant storylines. The first is an examination of how offensive football strategy has evolved over the past three decades in large part due to linebacker Lawrence Taylor's arrival in the 1980s and how this evolution has placed an increased importance on the role of the offensive left tackle. Most quarterbacks are right-handed and in order to throw, they stand with their left shoulders facing down field. Thus, they turn their backs to linebackers and other defenders pass rushing from the left side, creating a vulnerable \"blind side\" that the left tackle must protect. Taylor's speed and power changed the role of outside linebacker to become a more attacking, aggressive position. This in turn caused teams to emphasize larger and more agile left tackles.\n\nThe second storyline features Michael Oher, the former left tackle for the Ole Miss football team, and later right tackle for the Baltimore Ravens. Lewis follows Oher from his impoverished upbringing through his years at Briarcrest Christian School, his adoption by Sean (Michael Lewis's former schoolmate) and Leigh Anne Tuohy and on to his position as one of the most highly coveted prospects in college football.\n\nThe film \"The Blind Side\" was directed by John Lee Hancock and primarily follows the story of Michael Oher. It stars Quinton Aaron as Oher, along with Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, and Kathy Bates. It also features appearances by several past and present college football coaches playing themselves.\n\n", "id": "7708732", "categories": ["American football books", "2006 non-fiction books", "Books by Michael Lewis"], "title": "The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game"}

Samlesbury Hall, a historic house, is located in the village as is Samlesbury Aerodrome. The village is also home to a large modern brewery owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev. The population of the Civil Parish taken at the 2011 census was 1,206.\n\nThe village's name is derived from the Old English \"sceamol\", meaning ledge and \"burh\" meaning fortification, hence literally \"ledge fortification\". It may also be that the name at least partly derives from the Roman name for the River Ribble and its eponymous Celtic deity, Belisama.\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries there was fortified house near the river, probably a stone tower, held by the Denyas family. It was destroyed by the Scots during The Great Raid of 1322. A family heiress, Alicia Denyas, married Gilbert de Southworth, builder of Samlesbury Hall.\n\nThe parish was part of Preston Rural District throughout its existence from 1894 to 1974. In 1974 the parish became part of South Ribble.\n\nSamlesbury Hall is a manor house built in 1325 which has been many things since then including a public house and girls' boarding school, but since 1925, when it was saved from being demolished for its timber, it has been administered by a registered charitable trust, the Samlesbury Hall Trust. This Grade I listed medieval manor house attracts more than 50,000 visitors each year.\n\nSamlesbury parish church, like the one at nearby Walton-le-Dale, is dedicated to St. Leonard the Less and was founded in 1096. The church contains a Norman tub font, a medieval bell and Sir Thomas Southworth's funerary armour dating from 1546. It also has a church chest, a two-decker pulpit and a complete set of box pews dating from the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe Roman Catholic church is St Mary and St John Southworth. There was previously also a Wesleyan Methodist chapel.\n\nSamlesbury benefits from having its own primary school called Samlesbury Church of England Primary School. The school is located beside the Church of St Leonard the Less, on the banks of the River Ribble.\n\nThe Samlesbury witches—Jane Southworth, Jennet Brierley and Ellen Brierley—were accused of child murder and cannibalism and tried at Lancaster Assizes on 19 August 1612, in the same series of trials as the Pendle witches. All three were found not guilty in a trial which one historian has described as \"largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda\".\n\nSamlesbury brewery is a large modern brewery belonging to InBev. It was completed in 1972 to brew Heineken lager for Whitbread. It produces \"Boddington's Bitter\", and bottled and keg \"Bass Pale Ale\" for export.\n\nSamlesbury Engineering was a subsidiary of the Lancashire Aircraft Corporation at Warton which was chaired by Sir Wavell Wakefield, later Lord Wakefield of Kendal. The company specialised in bus manufacturing but was capable of high-quality engineering.\n\nTheir workshop, where the ill-fated Bluebird K7 was designed and built, was on the car park behind Samlesbury Hall. Bluebird K7 was the turbo jet-engined hydroplane in which Donald Campbell set seven world water speed records during the 1950s and in which he was killed on Coniston Water in 1967.\n\nThe Lancashire Aircraft Corporation, together with Samlesbury Engineering, eventually became part of what is now BAE Systems, which today has a facility at BAE Samlesbury.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n", "id": "7708826", "categories": ["Villages in Lancashire", "Geography of South Ribble", "Aviation in Lancashire"], "title": "Samlesbury"}

Robert Unwin Harwood (January 22, 1798 – April 12, 1863) was the last Seigneur of Vaudreuil, commanding officer of the Vaudreuil Militia, and for thirty years a political figure in Lower Canada and Canada East.\n\nHarwood was christened at Sheffield Cathedral, England, third son of William Harwood and Elizabeth Unwin. Representing William Harwood & Sons- his family's wholesale silver and hardware business in Sheffield that exported to Jamaica, Bermuda, Baltimore and Lower Canada -he came to Montreal in 1821. The obscure young merchant's fortunes were significantly improved when, two years later, he married Marie-Louise Josephte de Lotbinière (1803 - 1869), eldest daughter of Michel-Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbinière.\n\nHe was named to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada in 1832 and served until the Lower Canada Rebellion led to the dissolution of the council. He was a member of the Special Council from August 1839 until it was dissolved in 1841. After several unsuccessful attempts, in 1858, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Vaudreuil; he resigned in 1860 to run (successfully) for a seat in the Legislative Council for Rigaud division. In 1853, Harwood helped found the Vaudreuil Railway Company.\n\nDespite being an Englishman who had married into the right to be called a seigneur, Harwood was held in great respect by his tenants. Exchanging a life of society and business in Montreal, he and his wife arrived in Vaudreuil in 1829 to bring the estate back to order. Rather than relying on rents as an income he built a large scale co-operative mill to the great benefit of all those who lived on his land. He gave generously to churches, schools and the needy in Vaudreuil. He described his interest in pursuing reforms in agriculture and transportation as 'a hobby', but he displayed a firm grasp of the problems facing his tenants, and it revealed his genuine concern to improve things. \n\nWhen it came to collecting his seigneurial dues he preferred leniency to litigation, adding to the respect and admiration that his tenents held for him. His brother in England on the other hand berated him for his liberal attitude writing to him that 'the management of property to advantage is a talent not possessed by many, and certainly not by our family'. But the French-speaking newspaper \"La Minerve\" wrote at his death,\n\n\"Mr Harwood's conduct as a seigneur has been and remains irreproachable... Few seigneurs were as well liked by their \"censitaires\" as he was... The Hon. Robt. Harwood was much respected, indulgent to his tenantry, of unspotted reputation, courteous and considerate to all with whom he had relations\"\n\nIn 1830, Harwood rebuilt the old manor house at Vaudreuil where his wife had grown up, naming the new house 'Chateau Vaudreuil'. It was a large and imposing four storey, stone house on a hill, that burned down in 1870. After Harwood's death, when the Seigneurial system of New France had been abolished, his heirs sold the house and it subsequently became the College de St. Raphael before it was destroyed by fire. After the fire, under the foundation stone a leaden plate stamped with three fleurs de lys was found bearing the French inscription - (requires a source!)\n\n\"This stone was laid by Lady Louise Elyzabeth de Joybert, wife of the high and powerful Seigneur Philippe de Rigaud (Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil), Chevalier, Marquis de Vaudreuil, Grand Cross Order of Saint Louis, Governor and Lieutenant-General to the King of all of New France in 1723, the 15th of March.\"\n\nLady Louise de Joybert was the daughter of Pierre de Joybert de Soulanges et de Marson and his wife Marie-Francoise (who died in Paris, 1732), the daughter of Louis-Théandre Chartier de Lotbinière, Mrs Harwood's great, great, great grandfather.\n\nIn 1823, at Vaudreuil, Robert Unwin Harwood married Marie-Louise-Josephte Chartier de Lotbinière (1803–1869), the eldest daughter of the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michel-Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbinière, and heiress to the Seigneury of Vaudreuil. Her mother, Mary Charlotte Munro, was a daughter of Captain The Hon. John Munro. The Harwood children became known as the de Lotbinière-Harwoods - co-seigneurs of Vaudreuil and first cousins of Sir Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière, Prime Minister of Quebec and Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia. Their children were:\n\n\nRobert Unwin Harwood died at Chateau Vaudreuil in 1863, and he and his family are buried in the Chartier de Lotbiniere (subsequently the de Lotbiniere-Harwood) vault at their Church, Saint-Michel, Vaudreuil, built by Mrs Harwood's grandfather, Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière.\n\n", "id": "7708891", "categories": ["Members of the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada", "Anglophone Quebec people", "Members of the Special Council of Lower Canada", "Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada", "Members of the Legislative Council of Lower Canada", "Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint Louis", "1863 deaths", "1798 births"], "title": "Robert Unwin Harwood"}

DTMB system is compatible with fixed reception (indoor and outdoor) and mobile digital terrestrial television.\n\n\nThe DTMB standard uses many advanced technologies to improve their performance, for example, a pseudo-random noise code (PN) as a guard interval that allows faster synchronization system and a more accurate channel estimation, Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) for error correction, modulation Time Domain Synchronization - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) which allows the combination of broadcasting in SD, HD and multimedia services, etc.\n\nThis system gives flexibility to the services offered to support the combination of single-frequency networks (SFN) and multi-frequency networks (MFN). The different modes and parameters can be chosen depending on the type of service and network's environment.\n\nThe sequence of pseudo-random pattern is defined in time domain and the information of the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is defined in the frequency domain. The two frames are multiplexed in the time domain, resulting in Time domain synchronization (TDS).\n\nThis transmission system makes the conversion of the input signal to the output data of terrestrial TV signal.\n\nThe data passes through the encoder, the error protection process FEC (Forward Error Correction), through the constellation mapping process and then the interleaving processes the information to create the data blocks. The data block and the TPS information are multiplexed, and pass through the data processor to form the body structure. It combines information from the body and the head to form the frame and this is passed through the SRRC (Square Root Raised Cosine) filter to become a signal within an 8 MHz channel bandwidth. Finally the signal is modulated to put it in the corresponding frequency band.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7708951", "categories": ["Digital television", "Science and technology in the People's Republic of China"], "title": "Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast"}

It houses the Royal Military School of Music, training musicians for the British Army, which acquired the building in the mid-19th century. It is also home to the school's Museum of Army Music. The Army is scheduled to vacate the site in 2020.\n\nThe first house on the site was built by Edmund Cooke between 1635 and 1646 and in 1664 was the fourth largest house in Twickenham.\n\nIn 1709 the property was purchased by Sir Godfrey Kneller, court painter to British monarchs from Charles II to George I. He had the original house demolished and replaced by a new building, reputedly designed by Sir Christopher Wren. This second house was known as Whitton Hall, after the village, but was renamed by Kneller's widow, in memory of her husband. In 1757, the house was sold to Sir Samuel Prime, a prominent London lawyer, who, with his son of the same name, extended it significantly and landscaped the grounds. After Samuel Prime junior died in 1813, the hall was sold to Charles Calvert, Whig MP for Southwark from 1812 to 1832. He further expanded the house (to designs by Philip Hardwick), adding drawing rooms at the east and west ends of the building. Calvert died of cholera in 1832 and his widow inhabited until death about 1845. The house was then acquired by the government as a teacher training college but it needed substantial reconstruction.\n\nAround 1850 much of the Wren bulk of the house was dilapidated and so was demolished. The Hardwick additions formed the wings of the new house, the one still standing today, designed by George Mair. This third building on the site is stone-corniced, casemented and constructed as to its ground floor central range and otherwise built of red bricks, all in the neo-Jacobethan style suitable to 19th and 20th century mansions of its scale. It consists of 17 bays, the central of which is the widest and of stained glass and the two adjacent of which are arrow-slit windows. The bays are split into five recessed or projecting ranges. Two square, pavilion towers form the near left and right bays, each tower crowned by a stone and leaded ogee-shaped cupola. Its gatepiers and house are separately listed by Historic England in the initial, grade II category.\n\nFrom 1850 to 1856 Kneller Hall served as a teacher training college under principal Frederick Temple and vice-principal Francis Turner Palgrave, known for his poetry anthology \"Palgrave's Golden Treasury\". In exchange for a two-year college education almost entirely subsidised by the state – one of the first forms of state-sponsored social mobility – graduates of the college were supposed to teach pauper and delinquent boys in specially built district schools. Though Kneller Hall itself was generously funded by the state, the larger scheme to build district schools never came to fruition owing to political and religious conflict. The college closed when it was unable to attract any more students, who were now expected to teach in miserable conditions in Britain's workhouses. \n\nOn 3 March 1857 the building was taken over by the War Office as the base for a school for army bandsmen; it then evolved into the Royal Military School of Music. During the Second World War the site was briefly the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces from late 1939 until the headquarters moved out to St Paul's School in July 1940.\n\nOn 18 January 2016 defence minister Mark Lancaster announced that Kneller Hall was one of 12 Ministry of Defence (MoD) sites proposed to be released as part of the MoD’s drive for greater efficiency. In November 2016 the MoD announced that the site would close in 2020.\n", "id": "7709047", "categories": ["History of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames", "Training establishments of the British Army", "Middlesex", "Music education organizations", "History of Middlesex", "Military of the United Kingdom", "Houses in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames", "1646 establishments in England"], "title": "Kneller Hall"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709106", "text": "Recycling in Canada\n\nThis article outlines the position and trends of recycling in Canada. Since the 1980s, most mid to large municipalities in most provinces have recycling programs. As of 2012, Canada has a recycling rate around 26.8% \n\nIn 1981 Resource Integration Systems (RIS) in collaboration with Laidlaw International tested the first blue box recycling system on 1500 homes in Kitchener, Ontario. Due to the success of the project the City of Kitchener put out a contract for public bid in 1984 for a recycling system citywide. Laidlaw won the bid and continued with the popular blue box recycling system. Today hundreds of cities around the world use the blue box system or a similar variation.\n\nIn Alberta, the Alberta Recycling Management Authority (also known as \"Alberta Recycling\") is an arms-length body set up by the Government of Alberta under the Ministry of the Environment to coordinate recycling in the province. It administers the surcharge that has been added to the price of electronics, paint, and tires sold in the province since 2005 to pay for the recycling of those products in Alberta, and it helps to administer the province's household hazardous waste disposal program.\n\nA separate management authority, the Beverage Container Management Board (BCMB), is responsible for recycling of beverage containers. Beverage container recycling regulations were first introduced province-wide in 1972, but the BCMB was created in 1997 to create a provincial oversight body for the industry. The BCMB oversees two non-profit corporations which process the materials, the Alberta Beer Container Corporation (ABCC) for standard-sized beer bottles (which reuses rather than recycles the bottles) and the Alberta Beverage Container Recycling Corporation (ABCRC) for all other beverage containers. Containers are actually collected at privately owned, for-profit bottle depots. there are over 200 such bottle depots in Alberta, which are members of the Alberta Bottle Depot Association.\n\nThe Recycling Council of Alberta is a registered charity which has promoted recycling in Alberta since 1987. Specific industry groups lobby for their niche within the recycling sector, such as the Alberta Plastics Recycling Association.\n\nCurbside recycling of newsprint, cardboard, plastic packaging, and other non-food household wastes is the responsibility of the individual municipalities of Alberta. Most of Alberta's most populous municipalities have blue box, blue bag, or blue bin recycling container programs. The two largest municipalities, however, adopted waste-diverting policies at a very different pace. Edmonton began a pilot project in curbside recycling for single-family houses in 1986 and adopted it citywide in 1988, expanding over the years to include more items (Christmas trees in 1990, and construction waste in 2008), and higher levels of processing including large-scale composting and capturing methane to produce energy. In addition, the scope of collection has expanded to include multifamily buildings in 2001 and businesses in 2010. It is expected that when the waste-to-biofuel plant is completed in 2012, Edmonton will divert 90% of its waste from landfills.\n\nBy contrast Calgary conducted a pilot project on curbside recycling in 1991 and then abandoned curbside collection for a drop-off system until a second pilot program in 2004, and currently collects recyclates only at private houses, with no plans to introduce collection at condo and apartment buildings before 2015.\n\nThe curbside collection systems for recyclates vary across Canada:\n\n\nMunicipalities and provinces with recycling programs:\n\n\nThe different types of recyclable materials collected include:\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7709106", "categories": [], "title": "Recycling in Canada"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709125", "text": "Recycling in the United States\n\nThere is no national law in the United States that mandates recycling, and state and local governments often introduce their own recycling requirements. In 2014, the recycling/composting rate for municipal solid waste in the US was 34.6%. A number of U.S. states, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, and Vermont have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers while other jurisdictions rely on recycling goals or landfill bans of recyclable materials.\n\nOn a national level, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) oversees a variety of waste issues. These include regulation of hazardous wastes, landfill regulations, and setting recycling goals.\n\nMore specific recycling legislation is localized through city or state governments. State regulation falls into two major categories: landfill bans and recycling goals. Landfill bans make it illegal to dispose of enumerated items in a landfill. Most often these items include yard waste, oil, and recyclables easily collected in curbside recycling programs. States with landfill bans of recyclables include Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, and North Carolina. Other states focus on recycling goals. These include California and Illinois. One ways in which some states encourage recycling of specific drink containers is through the passage of a bottle bill.\n\nA number of U.S. states, such as California, Hawaii, Oregon, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Iowa, Michigan, and New York have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers in order to promote reuse and recycling. Most are five cents per can or bottle. Michigan's has maintained a 10 cent deposit value for bottles and cans since 1976.\n\nSome cities, such as Seattle, and states like Connecticut, have created mandatory recycling laws that may fine citizens who throw away a certain percentage of recyclable materials in their garbage waste. Vermont also employed a landfill ban of recyclable materials, food and yard waste, and wood. There are also voluntary programs and educational programs to increase recycling where it is not mandated by law.\n\nDisposal of recyclables in the garbage is prohibited from households, businesses and apartments. For businesses, that would include prohibiting the disposal of cardboard, paper, and yard waste in the garbage. For apartments and houses, disposal of glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, and plastic in the garbage would be prohibited. With businesses and apartments, if garbage collectors find more than 10 percent of the container filled with recyclables, they will leave a tag. On the third tag, the business or apartment tenants will receive a $50 fine. However, households do not face the risk of being fined. If trash collectors find over 10 percent of their garbage contains recyclables, they will leave a tag asking the household to separate the garbage and recyclables for collection the next week.\n\nIn a 1996 article in \"The New York Times\", John Tierney claimed that government mandated recycling wastes more resources than it saves.\nTierney's article received a referenced critique from the Environmental Defense Fund, which noted that \"the article relied heavily on quotes and information supplied by a group of consultants and think tanks that have strong ideological objections to recycling or a vested financial\ninterest in opposing it\".\n\nIn 2003, Daniel K. Benjamin (a professor of economics at Clemson University) published a paper through the Property and Environment Research Center that reiterated many of the points brought up in the \"New York Times article\", backing them up with a detailed inquiry into the recycling industry of the US. In 2010, he followed up on that with an updated look into the recycling policies of the US, finding that not much has changed.\n\nWhen the recycling industry was in its infancy in the United States, the financial costs of collecting, depositing, and processing recyclables exceeded that of trash disposal. Some opponents of recycling argued that state support for recycling may be more financially expensive in the short term than alternatives such as landfill disposal. For example, recycling efforts in New York City cost $57 million per year in 2002 and by 2015 it cost the city $300 more to recycle each ton of waste than to dump it in landfill. To refute this argument, people pointed out that the social benefits to society from recycling compensate for any difference in cost. Landfilling waste is an inefficient use of resources, contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere when unharvested or incompletely harvested, and by the pollution of groundwater and waterways. The long term financial and social costs of pollution caused by landfilling waste are often not taken into consideration.\n\nHowever, in many regions of the country, there are now an economic incentives to recycle. As early as 2003, Fort Worth Texas was making $1,000,000 from their recycling program. Similarly, Waukesha County's recycling program in Wisconsin began operating with positive revenues in 2004.\nMost recently, Waukesha County began receiving a $6.50 per ton bonus for recyclables coming into their private MRF (Materials Recycling Facility). Combining that with the average revenue from the sale of the materials minus the long-term costs incurred if the items had been landfilled, the average total lost revenue (county's share) for recyclables thrown in the landfill is $112.50.\n\nRecycling statistics (ca. 2014)\n\n\nThe New York Times reported in May 2018 that in somes cases, 25% of all recyclables collected are sent to landfill.\n\nRecycling rates vary by material and product type.\n\n\nElectronic waste or e-waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Used electronics which are destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling, or disposal are also considered e-waste. Informal processing of e-waste in developing countries can lead to adverse human health effects and environmental pollution.\n\nElectronic scrap components, such as CPUs, contain potentially harmful components such as lead, cadmium, beryllium, or brominated flame retardants. Recycling and disposal of e-waste may involve significant risk to workers and communities in developed countries and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from landfills and incinerator ashes.\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), it is important to dispose of electronics via recycling because,\"Electronic products are made from valuable resources and materials, including metals, plastics, and glass, all of which require energy to mine and manufacture. Donating or recycling consumer electronics conserves our natural resources and avoids air and water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by manufacturing virgin materials.\" Consumer recycling options include donating equipment directly to organizations in need, sending devices directly back to their original manufacturers, or getting components to a convenient recycler or refurbisher.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency reports 290 million scrap tires were generated in 2003. Of the 290 million, 45 million of these scrap tires were used to make automotive and truck tire re-treads. In 2017, 287 million were generated, 38 million reused and 249 million scrapped. With landfills minimizing their acceptance of whole tires and the health and environmental risks of stockpiling tires, many new markets have been created for scrap tires. Growing markets exist for a majority of scrap tires produced every year, supported by state and local government. Tires are also often recycled for use on basketball courts and new shoe products.\n\nTires are not desired at landfills, due to their large volumes and 75% void space, which quickly consumes valuable space. As of 2017, 40 states banned whole tires from landfills, 38 allowed shredded tires, 24 allowed processed tires in mono-fills. Fees are collected by 37 states.\n\nIn 2017, 81.4% of scrapped tires were marketed for some beneficial use, down from 87.9% in 2015. Of the 3,411 thousand tons of marketed scrap tires, 50.8% were used as fuel, 29.6% as ground rubber. Of the tires used as fuel, 46% were consumed in cement kilns, 29% in pulp and paper mills and 25% in electric utility boilers.\n\nThe United States has decreased the number of waste tires in storage from about 1 billion in 1992, down to 60 million tires in 2017, primarily due to state scrap management programs. Most of the remaining stockpiles are in Colorado and Texas.\n\nUS state laws and regulations dealing with scrap tires are currently enacted in 48 states. Here are some common features of state programs that deal with scrap tires: source of funding for the program; licensing or registration of scrap tire haulers, processors, and end users; manifests for scrap tire shipments; limitations on who may handle scrap tires; financial assurance requirements for scrap tire handlers; and market development activities. Some state programs are now supported by fees charged to the consumer at purchase or disposal of each tire. These fees, sometimes called “tipping fees”, help to support recycling costs. When the disposal rates charged to consumers are set high, this, in turn, discourages landfill disposal, a simple solution encouraging more affordable tire recycling programs.\n\nFor most of the early 21st century, China was the main destination for the world's scrap material. This resulted from a combination of factors, including the growing need for metal, paper and plastics in China's expanding industry, lax environmental regulations, cheap labor, and inexpensive shipping using containers that would otherwise be returned to China empty. In the United States, this resulted in a strong market for many scrap commodities and allowed local recycling programs to come close to breaking even economically or even to turn a small profit. That situation abruptly changed in 2017 when China announced its ‘’’National Sword’’’ program which banned many scrap imports and imposed strict quality standards on others, starting in February 2018. Acceptable limits for contamination in imported waste were cut from 5-10 percent to 0.5 percent. Since then almost no plastic scrap has been exported to China from the United States and shipments of metal and paper scrap have been sharply reduced. Scrap plastic imports dropped from 3.5 million metric tons in 2017 to 21,300 metric tons in the first half of 2018. As a result, scrap prices in the U.S. have plummeted. U.S. recycling industry is responding by investing in better sorting equipment to attempt to meet the National Sword standards and by developing new market for waste materials both within the U.S. and in other countries, including Southeast Asia and India. However several countries in Southeast Asia have announced their own restrictions on recycling.\n\nThe first recorded mass recycling program in the United States, \"Ban The Can,\" was conceived and executed in 1970 by Ruth \"Pat\" Webb in Honolulu, Hawaii. Webb organized military and civilian volunteers to collect over 9 tons (8,200 kg) of metal cans from the roadways and highways of Oahu. The metal cans were later recycled into steel reinforcement bars to be used in local construction projects.\n\nThe Stanolind Recycling Plant was in operation as early 1947. Another early recycling mill was Waste Techniques, built in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania in 1972. Waste Techniques was sold to Frank Keel in 1978, and resold to BFI in 1981. Woodbury, New Jersey, was the first city in the United States to mandate recycling. Led by Donald Sanderson who was President of Woodbury City Council and Woodbury Recycling Committee in the early 1970s, the idea of towing a \"recycling\" trailer behind a waste management vehicle to enable the collection of trash and recyclable material at the same time emerged. Other towns and cities soon followed suit, and today many cities in the United States make recycling a requirement.\n\nIn 1987, the Mobro 4000 barge hauled garbage from New York to North Carolina; where it was denied. It was then sent to Belize, where it was denied as well. Finally, the barge returned to New York and the garbage was incinerated. The incident led to heated discussions in the media about waste disposal and recycling. The incident is often referred to as igniting the recycling \"hysteria\" of the 1990s.\n\nIntegrating recycling into K-12 educational system has become a goal for many educators. Usually, it is integrated into science or social studies classrooms. This is due to its inclusion in the national education standards for both of these subject areas. Common areas that recycling is integrated into the curriculum include areas such as the study of natural resources, general environmental units, soil units, water units, community units, economic units, and geography units. Although interest is growing, major textbook publishers do not always include recycling in a textbook so teachers are left to supplement the textbooks with outside curriculum to meet the national standards. For example, in a unit about trees or natural resources teachers could include supplemental curriculum about recycling because in the textbook it is never explicitly covered. Non-profit organizations as well as governmental organizations have created supplemental curriculum for teachers to fill this void. Some purely non-profit groups include the Center for a New American Dream and Be SMART. Other creators of curriculum include governmental offices. Some of these include Oregon, California, and Waukesha County, Wisconsin. Also, some non-profit organizations have partnered with sections of the government to collaborate on educational materials. For example, the Keystone Center partnered with the United States Department of Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory to create curriculum on global warming.\n\nAmerica Recycles Day (ARD) is the only nationally recognized day dedicated to encouraging Americans to recycle and buy recycled products. ARD is celebrated annually on November 15. The World Recycling Day celebrated in most countries, though falls on July 8. Thousands of events are held across the U.S. to raise awareness about the importance of recycling and to encourage American to sign personal pledges to recycle and buy products made from recycled materials.\n\nStarted by the recycling sector organization National Recycling Coalition in 1997, America Recycles Day has been a program of national nonprofit Keep America Beautiful since 2009. As the managing entity of America Recycles Day, Keep America Beautiful provides promotional and marketing support and resources to a network of local event organizers. It is sponsored by private and public entities and the EPA.\n\nAlthough America may not enjoy much of a reputation for environmentalism on the global stage, in some US cities, recycling levels are much higher than, for example, in the UK.\n\n\n", "id": "7709125", "categories": ["Recycling in the United States", "Waste management in the United States"], "title": "Recycling in the United States"}

There was Bute Camanachd and North Bute Shinty Club: North Bute competed in the first ever Sutherland Cup final in 1923. The club has existed in its present form since 1946.\n\nThe club won the Sutherland Cup in 1972 and has won the reintroduced Balliemore Cup on four occasions, notably in the first final in 1985 as well as in 2006, when they defeated a Beauly team who held home advantage. 2006 was one of the club's most successful seasons of all time winning South Division One thus gaining promotion to the Premier Division, winning the Balliemore Cup and reaching the final of the Celtic Society Cup.\n\nIn 2008, after several years as a one team club, Bute restarted their second team, which finished fifth in South Division Two in their first season.\n\nThe club reached the semi-finals of the Camanachd Cup for the first time in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, they were the last club to finish their season on 12 December 2009. They eventually survived relegation, overhauling Lochaber Camanachd with a win against Oban Camanachd.\n\n2010 saw Bute's period in the Premier Division come to an end with a loss against Oban Camanachd, who had been behind the whole season until that last game.\n\nBute romped back into the Premier Division in 2011 with a stunning 100% record in the league as well as winning the Balliemore Cup. Bute were relegated in 2012 from a very competitive Premiership.\n\nThe club's top player during this successful period has been Hector Whitelaw, a full international and a powerful player capable of playing both upfront and at the back. He is a prolific goalscorer.\n\nThe club was one of the main opponents of the national league setup due to the difficulty of traveling to away games in places such as Cannich and Portree. (Until the establishment of Lewis Camanachd, they were the only senior team in Scotland with no fixed link to the mainland.).\n\nThe stepping back of Whitelaw to the second team and the loss of the Zavaroni brothers to Kyles Athletic saw Bute take a step back but they still made good showings in the cups and also made it into the National Division One setup for 2014 with a second-place finish in Division South One.\n\nSeveral other player changes in 2014 led to a disastrous showing in National Division One, even conceding a game at one point. Bute finished rock bottom and were due for relegation to South Division One, but were given a reprieve due to league reconstruction. However, Bute elected to be relegated to South Division One, feeling that National Division shinty was not feasible for the club at that time. In January 2015, former referee Ted McDonald became their senior team coach.\n\n", "id": "7709153", "categories": ["Shinty teams", "Sports clubs established in 1906", "Sport in Argyll and Bute"], "title": "Bute Shinty Club"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709166", "text": "Nostos\n\nNostos (Ancient Greek: ) is a theme used in Ancient Greek literature which includes an epic hero returning home by sea. In Ancient Greek society, it was deemed a high level of heroism or greatness for those who managed to return. This journey is usually very extensive and includes being shipwrecked in an unknown location and going through certain trials that test the hero. The return isn't just about returning home physically but also about retaining certain statuses and retaining your identity upon arrival. The theme of Nostos is brought to life in Homer's \"The Odyssey\", where the main hero Odysseus tries to return home after battling in the Trojan War. Odysseus is challenged by many temptations, such as the Sirens and the Lotus-eaters. If Odysseus had given into these temptations it would have meant certain death and thus failing to return home. Nostos is used today in many forms of literature and movies.\n\nIn the Odyssey, Homer has nostos being the \"return home from Troy by sea.\" Nostos can be told by those who experienced it themselves, or there are simply instances in which it is present. Those who told their adventures on the sea on their journey back home from Troy were Menelaus, Nestor, and Odysseus. Those three recount their adventures to others in the epic. With Menelaus, in Book Four, he tells of his time in Egypt and other irregular stops. He did not stop at just his nostos but he told of Agamemnon's fatal nostos in great detail as well as a small section of Odysseus' journey. Nestor gives more on Menelaus' nostos and his journey home with Odysseus and Menelaus. In Book Three Nestor said \"we pondered our long sea-voyage, whether we should sail over the top of rocky Chios by the island Psyros, keeping it on our left hand, or else to pass under Chios, by windy Mimas. We asked the god to give us some portent for a sign, and the god gave us one, and told us to cut across the middle main sea for Euboia, and so most quickly escape the hovering evil.\" Here Nestor made it evident to the audience that his and Diomedes' journey home was a perfect nostos, they had no real issues, which was quite different from Agamemnon's. This great difference shows how different each hero's journey home could be. In these instances where nostos is simply present and not told by the individual in \"The Odyssey,\" there is an intention to reach a specific destination and some other force blowing the characters off course and arrive in unexpected places on their journey to their home. \"The Odyssey\" had several different instances of nostos. One specific instance where Odysseus' companions lost their nostos, was when they ate Helios cattle and were killed for this since they were specifically told not to. Odysseus warned the men when he said \"Friends, since there is food and drink stored in the fast ship, let us then keep our hands off the cattle, for fear that something may befall us. These are the cattle and fat sheep of a dreaded god, Helios, who sees all things and listens to all things.\" At that point Odysseus warns the men of what will happen if they eat the cattle, yet they do anyway. This situation took away their nostos because their journey home came to an end.\n\nNot all Greek heroes experience nostos. Achilles' nostos is unique in \"The Iliad\"; this is because he knows himself that he will not have a nostos, creating a greater difference between him and the other heroes, such as Odysseus. Achilles knows that he has two options when it comes to the Trojan War - he can either die in the battle with glory and have a short life, or not participate and live a long yet insignificant life. In the ninth book, he says \"my nostos has perished, but my kleos will be unwilting\". In this instance, he has chosen the route of glory and says he will not now return home because it is destined that he will die in battle.\n\nOdysseus was able to tell his own story of his nostos since he has survived. Odysseus was able to tell part of his nostos to the Phaeacians, and the length of his journey shows how difficult it can be to achieve nostos. This arrival and telling of his tales is a big deal, though he has not reached home it is a huge mile marker. After Odysseus and his companions leave Circe's palace safely his crew members show their happiness by saying \"we rejoice for you saved yourself, nourished by Zeus, as much as if we had reached Ithaca,\" which shows the comparison of escaping to returning home.\n\nNostos meant several different things in this epic, it meant escaping death, safe landings, returning home from war, and being back home. All of those come through because as the hero returned from war the idea of escaping death from war remained in their forethought. These meanings all resemble nostos and when heroes are on their journey back they will have the ultimate Kleos once they have arrived and that is celebrated.\n\nThe word nostalgia was first coined as a medical term in 1688 by Johannes Hofer (1669-1752), a Swiss medical student. It uses the word νόστος along with another Greek root, άλγος or algos, meaning pain, to describe the psychological condition of longing for the past. \nIn James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", the final part (episodes 16-18), during which Leopold Bloom returns home, is called the \"Nostos\".\n\nAnother depiction of nostos in contemporary media would be the example of the movie, \"Hercules Unchained\", which was released in 1959. This movie was similar to the \"Odyssey,\" Hercules' journey was very similar to Odysseus'. One specific instance being when Hercules returned home with Iole whom he won in an archery contest, which is similar to Odysseus' contest to save his marriage. He was accidentally poisoned by his wife and asked to have his body set on fire. Having his body set on fire is what led to his many heroic achievements.\n\nDuring that time period there were no other films like this one that depicted this type of ancient material. Hercules' nostos had him die and then be reborn, this is to rediscover his identity within himself and the community. This is similar to Odysseus because he transforms personally from a war machine to a family man.\n\nThe TV series \"\", in which the titular spacecraft is stranded 70,000 light-years from Earth and encounters numerous hostile and friendly aliens and strange phenomena on its way home, has been described by classicists as a \"nostos.\"\n\n", "id": "7709166", "categories": ["Classical studies", "Ancient Greek poetry"], "title": "Nostos"}

It combines features of the lute, the harp, and the theorbo.\n\nIt shares the form of its pear shaped body as well as its vibrating string length of 54 to 70 cm with the lute. Differing from the lute, the 16 string angelica was single-strung like a theorbo, with which it shares its extended neck with a second peg box, bearing six bass strings.\n\nThe angelica was tuned diatonically, like a harp: C – E – F – G – A – B – c – d – e – f – g – a – b – c’ – d’ – e’. That range is the same as that of the French or lesser theorbo, but the latter differs in that its tuning is reentrant: C – D – E – F – G – A – B – c – d – g – c' – e'– a – d'. The diatonic tuning limited its compass, but produced a full and clear tone by the increased use of open strings.\n\nLittle surviving music for the angelica as well as few surviving instruments indicate that the angelica flourished during the second half of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries.\n\nSome authors claim that the angelica was invented in England. But that claim is based on the misinterpretation of its name (M. H. Fuhrmann, Musicalischer Trichter, Frankfurt/Spree 1706, p. 91). James Talbot correctly interpreted angelica as “angel lute“ because of its lovely sound (ms. Oxford 532, 1685–1701). \n\nMusic for the angelica is notated in French tablature, with the designation of bass courses varying according to respective authors. \n\nThe Ukrainian Torban is a descendant of the Angélique.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7709222", "categories": ["Baroque instruments", "Necked bowl lutes", "Early musical instruments", "Lutes", "String instruments"], "title": "Angélique (instrument)"}

Agerskov's literary production includes poems, novels, and also schoolbooks for the primary school and the secondary school in Denmark. Together with Erling Rørdam he also wrote a reader, published several times during 1904 and 1933, and also translated into Swedish.\n\nIn the first decade of the last century Michael Agerskov became interested in spiritistic phenomena, and participated in spiritistic séances together with his wife, and he also produced several poems by the means of what was called automatic writing, the hand writing down the thoughts of a discarnated spirit. Many of these poems were made public. It soon became obvious that Johanne Agerskov was an intermediary, and they formed a circle together with two other couples, and held séances, because they were told that they before their incarnation had promised to take on the task of being the instrumental to bring to mankind some truths from the transcendental world. Johanne Agerskov had the unique ability to close off her own thoughts, and to intuitively receive the thoughts of the spirits that contacted her. The other participants were called on to form questions, on which the spirits gave the answers, which were then written down. This work continued for several years, and resulted in the publishing of the ethic-religious, philosophic and scientific book \"Toward the Light\" and to several other books concerning the same issues. \n\nMichael Agerskov was the publisher of all the books, along with his work as a teacher, censor and author of his own literary works. \"Toward the Light\" was distributed to all the bishops and to 60 ministers of the Danish church, and the Agerskovs' hope and intention was the Danish church to go through a reformation on the basis of the information given in \"Toward the Light\" with the participation of the bishops and the ministers. But even though \"Toward the Light\" had many followers among the common people, the church did not react, and the book did not lead to a public interest to any extent. \n\nEven though Michael and Johanne Agerskov had participated in spiritistic séances, they soon urged the spiritists to end their activities. In \"Toward the Light\" there is very clearly stated that the spirits of the dead human beings are not allowed to visit the earth, because they need to rest and to prepare for their next incarnation. Only if we are called upon by the spirits of the light, we should react to their calling.\n\nAfter many requests, Michael Agerskov in 1922 wrote the story about the extraordinary events that had led to the publishing of \"Toward the Light\" in the book, \"Some Psychic Experiences\".\n\nIn 1928 Michael Agerskov had a serious attack of influenza, and as a repercussion of the illness he developed a serious condition of increasing paralysis of the muscles, and he had to end his work as a teacher. In 1932 he was so weak that he could not cross the floor of their living room by his own means, and soon after the condition also involved the heart muscle.

The route starts with a 10 km lap around the old and new Parliament buildings and other major government buildings. This is followed by a double lap crossing Lake Burley Griffin (over the Kings Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue bridges) and along Parkes Way out towards the Glenloch interchange, which is within close proximity to the Telstra Tower landmark.\n\nThe Ultra Marathon allows those who have entered into the race to \"go beyond the marathon\" and compete in a 50 km event. Once participants have completed the marathon consisting of a 42.195 km route they are then recorded as a marathon finisher and are eligible to complete the 50 km Ultra Marathon.\n\nRunners who complete 10 Canberra marathons are given the honorary title of Griffin, in reference to Lake Burley Griffin, which is at the centre of the marathon and the city of Canberra.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709402", "text": "Johanne Agerskov\n\nJohanne Elisabeth Agerskov (1873–1946) was a Danish medium. Together with her husband, Michael Agerskov, she was responsible for the ethico-religious, philosophical, and pseudo-scientific book, \"Toward the Light\" (in Danish, \"Vandrer mod Lyset!\"), first published by Michael Agerskov in Copenhagen in 1920.\n\nShe was a daughter of a Dutch inventor, minister and principal of the Royal Institute for Deaf-Mutes in Copenhagen Rasmus Malling-Hansen ( 1835 - 1890 ).\n\nIn her younger days Johanne Agerskov worked as a teacher, and she married Michael Agerskov in 1899. Their only daughter, Inger Agerskov, was born in 1900, and Johanne became a housewife. \n\nDuring the first decade of the twentieth century, Michael became interested in spiritual phenomena, and persuaded his wife to participate in séances, even though she was skeptical in the beginning. Soon Johanne came to believe that the spirits of the transcendental world had called upon her, and had given her the message that she was a medium, and that before her birth she had promised to be instrumental in bringing eternal truths to mankind.\n\nConvinced that she had a special mission, Agerskov and her husband formed a circle with two more couples, and for many years held weekly séances, in which they believed messages from the spirits of the light were given to Agerskov through intuitive thought-inspiration. She claimed a unique ability to close off her own thoughts, so that all she could \"hear\" in her mind, according to her, was the thoughts of the spirit with whom she was supposed to be in contact. That was very demanding, and in that period she gave up all the pleasures of social life, in order to be focused and prepared for the séances. The members of the circle would submit questions for her to ask the spirits, and shortly she would give them answers, supposedly from the spirits, which the other participants would write down.\n\nThat resulted in the publication of the book, \"Toward the Light\", which Agerskov called \"a message to mankind from the transcendental world\", and which she and her husband sent out to all the bishops and sixty ministers of the Danish national church. Their hope was that these would participate in a reformation of the Danish church, based upon the new knowledge given in \"Toward the Light\". The Agerskovs made great efforts to that end, through correspondence and by opening their home to anybody who wanted to see them about \"Toward the Light\"; but there was little public interest in the book, and the expected reformation did not take place.\n\nJohanne Agerskov was also deeply engaged in the work of her father. In 1924 a Danish professor asserted that Malling-Hansen was not the inventor of the Hansen Writing Ball, and Agerskov undertook a thorough investigation of the facts, together with her sister, Engelke Wiberg. They wrote several articles on the subject, and Agerskov also wrote a book, called \"Hvem var Skrivekuglens Opfinder?\" (\"Who was the Inventor of the Writing Ball?\"), published in Copenhagen in 1925.\n\nIn 1926 a Society for the Advancement of \"Toward the Light\" was formed , which offered religious services for its members, based on \"Toward the Light\". Agerskov was skeptical, however, because \"Toward the Light\" calls on believers to remain in the established church and to work for reformation from within.\n\nEven though the Agerskovs in the beginning had participated in spiritualist séances, they soon asked their followers to end that activity, because, as they asserted in \"Toward the Light\", calling on the spirits of deceased ancestors would bring problems to those who could not resist the call to appear. The spirits, they said, needed to rest and to prepare for their next incarnation, and were not allowed to visit the earth.\n\nMichael Agerskov died in 1933, but Johanne continued to answer letters and to publish up until 1938, in collaboration with their daughter. During the last years of her life, Johanne Agerskov suffered from illness, and was not able to leave her home.\n\nThere has been controversy among Agerskov's followers over whether or not to publish photos of her, as she said to destroy all her own pictures of herself before she died. Some of the followers of \"Toward the Light!\" contend that her will in this matter should be respected, and oppose the publication of such pictures.\n\nOthers see nothing wrong with publishing photos of her, considering that photos of her are available in public collections in both Denmark and Norway, and on the World-Wide Web. This article contains photos of both Agerskov and her husband, supplied by their descendants, who have no objection to their publication.\n\n\n", "id": "7709402", "categories": ["Danish philosophers", "1946 deaths", "1873 births"], "title": "Johanne Agerskov"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709451", "text": "Set-off (law)\n\nIn law, set-off or netting are legal techniques applied between persons with mutual rights and liabilities, replacing gross positions with net positions. It permits the rights to be used to discharge the liabilities where cross claims exist between a plaintiff and a respondent. The result being that the gross claims of mutual debt produces a single, net claim. The net claim is known as a net position. In other words, a set-off is the right of a debtor to balance mutual debts with a creditor. In bookkeeping terms, set-offs are also known as reconciliations. To determine a set-off, simply subtract the smaller debt from the larger. \n\nAny balance remaining due either of the parties is still owed, but the remainder of the mutual debts has been set off. The power of net positions is to reduce credit exposure, also holding regulatory capital requirement and settlement advantages, which contributes to market stability. In regard to the financial market, net positions are vital.\n\nWhilst netting and set off are often used interchangeably, the legal distinction is made between \"netting\", which describes the procedure for and outcome of implementing a \"set off\". By contrast \"set off\" describes the legal bases for producing net positions. \"Netting\" describes the form such as novation netting, or close-out netting, whilst \"set off\" describes judicially recognised grounds such as independent set off or insolvency set off. Therefore, a netting or setting off gross positions involves the use of offsetting positions with the same counter-party to address counter-party credit risk. This is to be differentiated from hedging which uses offsetting positions with multiple parties to mitigate risk.\n\nThe law does not permit counter-parties to use third party debt to set off against an un-related liability. All forms of set off requires mutuality between claim and cross claim. This protects property rights both inside insolvency and out, primarily by ensuring that a non-owner cannot benefit from insolvency.\n\nThe primary objective of netting is to reduce systemic risk by lowering the number of claims and cross claims which may arise from multiple transactions between the same parties. This prevents credit risk exposure, and prevents liquidators or other insolvency officers from cherry-picking transactions which may be profitable for the insolvent company. \n\nAt least three principle forms of netting may be distinguished in the financial markets. Each is heavily relied upon to manage financial market, specifically credit, risk\n\nAlso called rolling netting, netting by novation involves amending contracts by the agreement of the parties. This extinguishes the previous claims and replaces them with new claims.\n\nThis differs from settlement netting (outlined below) because the fusion of both claims into one, producing a single balance, occurs immediately at the conclusion of each subsequent contract. This method of netting is crucial in financial settings, particularly derivatives transactions, as it avoids cherry-picking in insolvency. The effectiveness of pre-insolvency novation netting in an insolvency was discussed in \"British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France\"[1975] 1 WLR 758. Similar to settlement netting, novation netting is only possible if the obligations have the same settlement date. This means that if, in the above example, transaction-2 was to be paid on Friday, the two transactions would not offset. Novation netting further cannot consolidate obligations. This is a systems intensive process requiring tracking of obligations as they become due.\n\nAn effective close-out netting scheme is said to be crucial for an efficient financial market. Close out netting differs from novation netting in that it extends to all outstanding obligations of the party under a master agreement similar to the one used by ISDA. These traditionally only operate upon an event of default of insolvency. In the event of counterparty bankruptcy or any other relevant event of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated (i.e. effected), all transactions or all of a given type are netted (i.e. set off against each other) at market value or, if otherwise specified in the contract or if it is not possible to obtain a market value, at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the non-defaulting party in replacing the relevant contract. The alternative would allow the liquidator to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to (and thus potentially \"cherry pick\"). There are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested.\nThe key elements of close out netting are:\nSimilar methods of close out netting exist to provide standardised agreements in market trading relating to derivatives and security lending such as\"repos\", forwards or options. The effect is that the netting avoids valuation of future and contingent debt by an insolvency officer and prevents insolvency officers from disclaiming executory contract obligations, as is allowed within certain jurisdictions such as the US and UK. The mitigated systemic risk which is induced by a close out scheme is protected legislatively. Other systemic challenges to netting, such as regulatory capital recognition under Basel II and other Insolvency-related matters seen in the \"Lamfalussy Report\" has been resolved largely through trade association lobbying for law reform. In England & Wales, the effect of \"British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France\" has largely been negated by \"Part VII\" of the Company Act 1989 which allows netting in situations which are in relation to money market contracts. In regard to the BASEL Accords, the first set of guidelines, BASEL I, was missing guidelines on \"netting\". BASEL II introduced \"netting\" guidelines.\n\nFor cash settled trades, this can be applied either bilaterally or multilaterally and on related or unrelated transactions.\nObligations are not modified under settlement netting, which relates only to the manner in which obligations are discharged. Unlike close-out netting, settlement netting is only possible in relation to like-obligations having the same settlement date. These dates must fall due on the same day and be in the same currency, but can be agreed in advance. Claims exist but are extinguished when paid. To achieve simultaneously payment, only the act of payment extinguishes the claim on both sides. This has the disadvantage that through the life of the netting, the debts are outstanding and netting will likely not occur, the effect of this on insolvency was seen in the above mentioned \"British Eagle\". These are routinely included within derivative transactions as they reduce the number and volume of payments and deliveries that take place but crucially does not reduce the pre-settlement exposure amount. \n\nSet off is a legal event and therefore legal basis is required for the proposition of when two or more gross claims are netted. Of these legal bases, a common form is the legal defense of set-off, which was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person (\"Party A\") who owed money to another (\"Party B\") could be sent to debtors' prison, despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A. The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court. This operated as an equitable shield, but not a sword. Upon judgment, both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing (e.g. If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105, the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A). Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that, where a party defaults, the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions (including the UK), certain types of set-off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company. This means that, for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company, mutual debts are set-off against each other, and then either the bankrupt's creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid, depending on which side owed the most. The primary argument This has been criticized as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu. The alternative, where a creditor has to pay all its debts, but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get, poses the danger of 'knock-on' insolvencies, and thus a systemic market risk. Even still, three core reasons underpin and justify the use of set-off. First, the law should uphold pre-insolvency autonomy and set-offs as parties invariably rely on the pre-insolvency commitments. This is a core policy point. Second, as a matter of fairness and efficiency both outside and inside insolvency reduces negotiation and enforcement costs. Third, managing risk, particularly systemic risk, is crucial. Clearing house rules offer stipulation that relationships with buyer and sellers are replaced by two relationships between buyer and clearing house, and seller and clearing out. The effect is an automatic novation, meaning all elements are internalized in current accounts. This can be in different currencies as long as they are converted during calculation.\n\nThe right to set off is particularly important when a bank's exposures are reported to regulatory authorities, as is the case in the EU under financial collateral requirements. If a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower and so is exposed because of the risk that the borrower might default, thereby leading to the loss of the money of the bank or its depositors, is thus replaced. The bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower with an exposure of the money lent, less the value of the security taken.\n\nTwo primary examples of set-off rules are outlined below. These are in addition to the financial regulations pertaining to netting set out by trade associations and the European Union through the Financial Collateral Directives. \n\nUnder English law, there are broadly five types of set-off which have been recognised:\n\nThe five types of set off are extremely important as a matter of efficiency and of mitigating risk. Contractual set offs recognised as an incident of party autonomy whereas banker right of combination is considered a fundamental implied term. It is an essential aspect for cross-claims, especially when there exits overlapping obligations. Common features of set-off are that they are confined to situations where claim and cross claim are for money or reducible to money and it requires mutuality.\n\nSee De Magno v. United States, 636 F.2d 714, 727 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (district court had jurisdiction over claim involving VA’s “affirmative \naction against an individual whether by bringing an action to recover on an asserted claim or by proceeding on its common-law right of set-off”) (discussing similar language of predecessor statute, 38 U.S.C. § 211)\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.

As a conductor, he specialized in the music of late romantic composers; including Edward Elgar, Gustav Mahler, and Richard Strauss. He left a great legacy of recordings of British music, in particular Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Frederick Delius, and Benjamin Britten. He notably conducted the premiere recording of Britten's children's opera \"Noye's Fludde\".\n\nBorn in Hampstead, London, Del Mar began his career as a horn player. He was one of the original members of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO), which was established by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1946. Within the first few months of the RPO's existence, Beecham appointed Del Mar as his assistant conductor. Del Mar made his professional debut as a conductor with the RPO in 1947.\n\nIn 1949 Del Mar was appointed principal conductor of the English Opera Group, in which post he remained until 1954. In 1952 he conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the world premiere of Franz Reizenstein's radio opera \"Anna Kraus\". He then held chief conducting posts with the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra (1954) the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (1960–1965), and the Aarhus Symphony Orchestra (1985–1988). A regular at the BBC Proms concerts, he conducted the famous Last Night on three occasions: 1973, 1975, and 1983. He was also 'permanent guest conductor' with the Göteborg Symphony Orchestra from 1969-1973.\nIn 1953 Del Mar joined the faculty of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama where he conducted the school's orchestra and taught conducting until 1960. In 1972 he began to teach conducting at the Royal College of Music, serving until 1990. He also conducted the Royal Academy of Music's orchestra from 1974-1977.\n\nIn 1976 he conducted the world premiere of Thomas Wilson's Opera The Confessions of a Justified Sinner, based on the novel by James Hogg. A cast led by Philip Langridge, Thomas Hemsley and John Shirley-Quirk speaks for itself. To keep a new work in the repertoire for as many as thirteen performances also shows the confidence the company had in the piece.\n\nHe was an authority on Richard Strauss and wrote a three-volume work on Strauss's life and music. In addition, his books include the following titles:\n\nAs well as making approximately 70 recordings of his own, Del Mar was a lifelong record collector, and his extensive collection of rare 78s is held by the University of Southampton.\n\nHe died in 1994, aged 74.

However, these clubs are not always student teams in the strictest sense of the word, and have a long history of participation at national senior level. Since the introduction of a summer season, only the Aberdeen University Shinty Club continues to play in the senior leagues, although Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews have all done so in the past.\n\nScottish universities have played a major role in shinty since the early days of the sport. The University of Aberdeen club was founded in 1861, and clubs were founded at universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow in the late Victorian era. Aberdeen played in North competitions and Edinburgh and Glasgow competed in South competitions. Often these teams would compete in \"Junior\" competitions but would also from time to time restrict themselves to the University Littlejohn competition.\n\nUniversity of St Andrews became the fourth and final team to enter league shinty in the late 1960s. This meant that all four of Scotland's ancient universities had a shinty team representing them. The original three had varying degrees of success but won, or appeared in the finals of several cup competitions as well as garnering league success throughout their league existence.\n\nThe Littlejohn of Invercharron Vase is the trophy played for by the universities. It was presented in 1905 and has been played for ever since. \n\nThe move to the summer season in the sport meant that of the four teams playing in the north and south leagues only the University of Aberdeen continued to play on a full-time basis.\n\nHowever, the change in status means that players from clubs playing in the National Leagues such as Kingussie and Fort William can now play for their university outwith the senior season. Previously these players could only compete in the annual one-day Littlejohn Vase tournament. They may now play in the winter University League.\n\nThe Scottish Universities also have a representative side which currently plays against the British Universities GAA in Composite rules Shinty/Hurling annually.\n\nThere are seven teams entering the University Shinty League for the 2010/11 season, these are Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, RGU (Robert Gordon University), St Andrews and Strathclyde. This season saw the demise of UHI, with many teams sighing in relief. The men's league is currently being led by a rejuvenated Glasgow side, with their female counterpart making a strong start to their season after many years playing under the banner of Strathclyde.\n\nThe sport of shinty as a whole has benefited greatly from its presence in universities. Many alumni have gone onto play a role in reviving or reinvigorating the sport in their home area or the area in which they have settled after graduation, including Skye, Lewis, London, Cornwall and Caithness. Many players have retained their links with the sport when otherwise they would have drifted away in the urban area.\n\nFor the article about the senior side of the same name see Aberdeen University Shinty Club.\n\nThis club is the successor to the University of Aberdeen side which continued in the senior leagues with the advent of summer shinty in 2004. The two clubs maintain a symbiotic relationship, by having the players from the senior team helping with training. Although non-students can play for the senior side, only students can play for the students' side. Aberdeen University welcome all players from all levels to train and play and are well known for giving people who have never played shinty a taste and help them develop into shinty players. See the senior side article for more information on the history of the club.\n\n\"See Edinburgh University Shinty Club for more information\"\n\nThe second oldest University club, founded in 1891, Edinburgh has, since 2011 become a force in the University sport, winning three Littlejohn's in 2012, 2013 and 2014. This brought to end an almost thirty-year drought.\n\n\"See Glasgow University Shinty Club for more information\"\n\nOne of the historically successful clubs, Glasgow University has failed to achieve success since winning South Division Two in 2003 and the advent of summer shinty.\n\n\"See St. Andrew's University Shinty Club\"\n\nTeams representing the University of Strathclyde had been competing in the Littlejohn Vase since the early 1990s. Most matriculated students who did not play for their home club tended to play for Glasgow University in the senior leagues. Despite being able to draw upon a good base of players and perhaps hampered by a lack of familiarity which other universities had from playing regularly together, Strathclyde did not win the Littlejohn until in 2005 when they also won the first official University league. They reached the final in 2006 when they lost to Robert Gordon. However, Strathclyde once again won the trophy in 2007 which saw them defeat Dundee University 2-0 in the final.\n\nThe Strathclyde team have been the strongest force in University shinty in the late 2000s with players from the Premier Division and North Division One making up the entirety of their team. They appeared in five straight Littlejohn finals equalling the record of bitter rivals Glasgow University.\nRobert Gordon University was started by shinty players such as Davie \"Trout\" Roberston in the 1990s but became a force in University shinty when Glenurquhart Shinty Club's John Barr who made RGU a tough proposition for any team, especially in Aberdeen, played for the University.\n\nRGU won the Littlejohn in 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2010. The University also runs a ladies' team, which featured Eilidh Middleton, an international Equestrianist. It also depends on many Irish students with a background in Hurling.\n\nDundee University Shinty Club is a shinty club from the city of Dundee founded in 2004. Its men's and women's teams are representing University of Dundee in University Shinty league and at numerous tournaments throughout the year. The club have performed rapidly since formation winning the SUSF (now SSS University) league in 2006/07 and also reaching the final of the Littlejohn Vase tournament in 2006. The current men's team captain is Hamish Duff.\n\nThe women's team was established in 2013 and officially entered University Shinty league prior to 2014/15 season. They also compete in the same tournaments throughout the year as the men's team. The current women's team captain is Kirsty Fraser.\n\nUniversity of Abertay Dundee have the distinction of having won every Littlejohn they have competed in, having only competed in one to this point in 2003 defeating Glasgow University in the final 2-1. They have failed to make an appearance at any Littlejohn since. They have a sixes team which plays infrequently.\n\nThe UHI Millennium Institute, which is a collection of various colleges from across the Scottish Highlands and Islands entered a team in the University Shinty League for the first time in 2008. As the UHI has institutions in areas such as Inverness-shire and Lochaber they can draw on a strong pool of players. By 2011 however UHI had folded, the difficulty in fulfilling midweek fixtures for a team made up mostly of tradesmen spread across the Highlands was a contributory factor.\n\n\n", "id": "7709530", "categories": ["Shinty teams", "Shinty"], "title": "University shinty"}

The LP, which Jennings produced with Randy Scruggs, did produce a number 1 hit: a cover of Little Richard's rock and roll classic \"Lucille (You Won't Do Your Daddy's Will),\" his twelfth number 1 since 1974. Jennings would not top the singles chart again until 1987. The single \"Breakin' Down\" also made the Top 10. Jennings contributed two songs for the LP: \"Let Her Do the Walking,\" which he wrote himself, and the reflective \"No Middle Ground,\" which he composed with Gary Scruggs. Songwriter Rodney Crowell, who had written Jennings' number 1 song \"I Ain't Living Long Like This\" and had become one of the singer's favorite writers, has two songwriting credits, including the title track and the ballad \"Angel Eyes\". Jennings' wife Jessi Colter, Marcia Beverly, and Jerry Gropp provide harmony vocals on the LP.\n\nUnderstandably, considering his condition at the time, Jennings was not fond of his work during this period: \"I was doing bad records.

Jennings seems to have done it to himself.

The club, which represents the University of Edinburgh has both male and female team sides, with players coming from other further and higher education establishments in the city, including Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh Napier and Edinburgh College. Whilst formally a University Shinty team, the club has a long history of playing at national level.\n\nThe period 1927 to 1933 is the most notable in the club's history, with the university retaining the Littlejohn Vase for six years in succession. In those days the team was also competing in the Southern League and the Camanachd Cup.\n\nThe team was once so strong it fielded a second string after the Second World War.\n\nThrough the 1960s and 1970s the club remained strong. In the 1980s the club competed in Division Three (South) save for one regrettable year of isolation when fixtures were provided by the Littlejohn Vase. Such a period shows how a University team’s fortunes can fluctuate as the season 1986-87 saw the team narrowly miss promotion, 1987-88 saw relegation to Division Four.\n\nIn 1991 the club enjoyed its centenary year in which a grand reunion was organised. Guests of honour included Sorley MacLean, who played for the club in the late twenties.\n\nIn 2004, the club played its last games of senior shinty with the advent of summer shinty, meaning that the university could not field a team through the summer months. Players now return to their hometown teams or will play for local sides Tayforth Camanachd and Aberdour Shinty Club.\n\n2011 saw a transition period for the club and the resurrection of the yearly challenge match with Trinity College where the Scottish and Irish capital sides play each other at the start of the year in a shinty/hurling match. The trip in 2011 proved so successful that a yearly tour to Dublin is now undertaken and eagerly anticipated. A friendship was formed with St Judes GAA in 2012 where the club travelled to Templeogue for a shinty/hurling challenge match. The club shall now play St Judes and Trinity in alternate years in the Irish capital, alongside St. Brigid's.\n\nThe successful ladies' side of the 2000s was instrumental in the foundation of Forth Camanachd and subsequent developments in ladies shinty in the area, with many transferring to Aberdour when Forth folded.\n\nIn 2012, the club won the Littlejohn for the first time in 26 years, defeating Glasgow University 1-0 in the final.

Although formally a University Shinty team, representing the University of Glasgow, it has a long history of competition in national competition.\n\nFounded in 1901, by Angus MacVicar, Murdo Mackenzie and Murdo MacRae, with MacVicar as the first team captain. It entered League competition between 1906 and 1908 and played on the pitch of the Glasgow Skye Shinty Club until 1909, after which it played at the Glasgow Cowal Club pitch at Possilpark, Glasgow. The Club became affiliated to the Glasgow University Sports Association in 1911. Throughout the years the club has also been very strong in University competition, its glory years being in the late 1950s and 1960s, when they won the southern league and the Littlejohn three years in a row. Throughout the latter half of the club's existence from the late 1940s until his death in 2015 Jack Asher, who latterly was honorary president, attended games and supported the club. The club organises an annual 6 aside tournament in his memory.\n\nThe club struggled in the 1980s although they had reached the final of the Sutherland Cup in 1981 but the late 1990s saw a renaissance in the team, the club appearing in 5 Littlejohn finals in a row, winning the trophy twice and the club's final season in 2003 in the south leagues saw them win South Division Two undefeated. However, the switch to a summer season in shinty resulted in the University leaving the league set-up. Their last senior fixture was a Glasgow Celtic Society Cup match against Tayforth in the spring of 2004.\n\nSince 2004 amid the advent of summer shinty, the club's fortunes suffered a downturn on the park, although membership stayed steady. Glasgow failed to reach a Littlejohn final or challenge for the league between 2005 and 2010 as an exceptionally strong Strathclyde side swept all before them. However, 2011 saw a rejuvenated Glasgow leading the University league and reach the Littlejohn Final for the first time since 2004. The club reached the final again in 2012 but they were thwarted by Edinburgh, who won their first trophy in 26 years, Glasgow's drought now lasting since 2002. In 2015 the club won the University league, notably completing the double over a Strathclyde team that went on to win the Littlejohn that year.\n\nThe club has one of the shortest pitches in shinty and was one of the first clubs to make effective use of the internet as a recruiting tool. The club is also a major force for promoting shinty, through Gaelic the team also known in Scots Gaelic as \"An t-Òr is Dubh\", the Gold and Blacks.\n\nThe archives of Glasgow University Shinty Club are maintained by the Archives of the University of Glasgow (GUAS).\n\n", "id": "7709563", "categories": ["1901 establishments in Scotland", "Shinty teams", "Sports clubs established in 1901", "Clubs and societies of the University of Glasgow", "Sports teams in Glasgow"], "title": "Glasgow University Shinty Club"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709600", "text": "All Saints' Day\n\nAll Saints' Day, also known as All Hallows' Day, Hallowmas, the Feast of All Saints, or Solemnity of All Saints, is a Christian festival celebrated in honour of all the saints, known and unknown. In Western Christianity, it is celebrated on 1 November by the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Methodist Church, the Church of the Nazarene, the Lutheran Church, the Reformed Church, and other Protestant churches. The Eastern Orthodox Church and associated Eastern Catholic Churches and Byzantine Lutheran Churches celebrate it on the first Sunday after Pentecost. Oriental Orthodox churches of Chaldea and associated Eastern Catholic churches celebrate All Saints' Day on the first Friday after Easter.\n\nIn the Western Christian practice, the liturgical celebration begins at Vespers on the evening of 31 October, All Hallows' Eve (All Saints' Eve), and ends at the close of 1 November. It is thus the day before All Souls' Day, which commemorates the faithful departed. In many traditions, All Saints' Day is part of the season of Allhallowtide, which includes the three days from 31 October to 2 November inclusive and in some denominations, such as Anglicanism, extends to Remembrance Sunday. On All Saints Day, it is common for families to attend church, as well as visit cemeteries in order to lay flowers and candles on the graves of their deceased loved ones. In Austria and Germany, godparents gift their godchildren Allerheiligenstriezel (All Saint's Braid) on All Saint's Day, while the practice of souling remains popular in Portugal. It is a national holiday in many historically Christian countries.\n\nThe Christian celebration of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day stems from a belief that there is a powerful spiritual bond between those in heaven (the \"Church triumphant\"), and the living (the \"Church militant\"). In Catholic theology, the day commemorates all those who have attained the beatific vision in Heaven. In Methodist theology, All Saints Day revolves around \"giving God solemn thanks for the lives and deaths of his saints\", including those who are \"famous or obscure\". As such, individuals throughout the Church Universal are honoured, such as Paul the Apostle, Augustine of Hippo and John Wesley, in addition to individuals who have personally led one to faith in Jesus, such as one's grandmother or friend.\n\nIn the British Isles, it is known that churches were already celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century to coincide with or replace the Celtic festival of Samhain.\nJames Frazer suggests that 1 November was chosen because it was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead (Samhain). However, Ronald Hutton points out that, according to Óengus of Tallaght (d. ca. 824), the 7th/8th century church in Ireland celebrated All Saints on 20 April. He suggests that 1 November date was a Germanic rather than a Celtic idea.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church, following the Byzantine tradition, commemorates all saints collectively on the first Sunday after Pentecost, All Saints' Sunday (Greek: Αγίων Πάντων, \"Agiōn Pantōn\").\n\nThe feast of All Saints achieved great prominence in the 9th century, in the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI \"the Wise\" (866–911). His wife, Empress Theophano – commemorated on 16 December – lived a devout life. After her death in 893, her husband built a church, intending to dedicate it to her. When he was forbidden to do so, he decided to dedicate it to \"All Saints\", so that if his wife were in fact one of the righteous, she would also be honoured whenever the feast was celebrated. According to tradition, it was Leo who expanded the feast from a commemoration of All Martyrs to a general commemoration of All Saints, whether martyrs or not.\n\nThis Sunday marks the close of the Paschal season. To the normal Sunday services are added special scriptural readings and hymns to all the saints (known and unknown) from the Pentecostarion.\n\nIn the late spring, the Sunday following Pentecost Saturday (50 days after Easter) is set aside as a commemoration of all locally venerated saints, such as \"All Saints of America\", \"All Saints of Mount Athos\", etc. The third Sunday after Pentecost may be observed for even more localised saints, such as \"All Saints of St. Petersburg\", or for saints of a particular type, such as \"New Martyrs of the Turkish Yoke\".\n\nIn addition to the Mondays mentioned above, Saturdays throughout the year are days for general commemoration of all saints, and special hymns to all saints are chanted from the Octoechos.\n\nThe celebration of 1 November in Lebanon as a holiday is simply the influence of Western Catholic orders present in Lebanon and is not Maronite in origin. The traditional Maronite feast equivalent to the honor of all saints in their liturgical calendar is one of three Sundays in preparation for Lent called the Sunday of the Righteous and the Just. The following Sunday is the Sunday of the Faithful Departed (similar to All Souls Day in Western calendar).\n\nIn East Syriac tradition the All Saints Day celebration falls on the first Friday after resurrection Sunday. This is because all departed faithful are saved by the blood of Jesus and they resurrected with the Christ. Normally in east Syriac liturgy the departed souls are remembered on Friday. Church celebrates All souls day on Friday before the beginning of Great lent or Great Fast.\n\nThe Christian holiday of All Saints' Day falls on 1 November, followed by All Souls' Day on 2 November, and is currently a Solemnity in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, a Festival in the Lutheran Churches, as well as a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communion.\n\nIn the early days the Christians were accustomed to solemnise the anniversary of a martyr's death for Christ at the place of martyrdom. In the 4th century, neighbouring dioceses began to interchange feasts, to transfer relics, to divide them, and to join in a common feast; as is shown by the invitation of St. Basil of Caesarea (397) to the bishops of the province of Pontus. In the persecution of Diocletian the number of martyrs became so great that a separate day could not be assigned to each. But the Church, feeling that every martyr should be venerated, appointed a common day for all. The first trace of this we find in Antioch on the Sunday after Pentecost. We also find mention of a common day in a sermon of St. Ephrem the Syrian (373), and in the 74th homily of St. John Chrysostom (407). According to Ephrem, this feast was observed at Edessa on 13 May, and John Chrysostom says it was on the Sunday after Pentecost in Constantinople. As early as 411 there is in the Chaldean Calendar a \"Commemoratio Confessorum\" for the Friday after Easter.\n\nOn 13 May 609 or 610, Pope Boniface IV consecrated the Pantheon at Rome to the Blessed Virgin and all the martyrs, ordering an anniversary; the feast of the \"dedication Sanctae Mariae ad Martyres\" has been celebrated at Rome ever since. There is evidence that from the 5th to the 7th centuries there existed in certain places and at sporadic intervals a feast date on 13 May to celebrate the holy martyrs. The origin of All Saints' Day cannot be traced with certainty, and it has been observed on various days in different places. However, there are some who maintain the belief that it has origins in the pagan observation of 13 May, the Feast of the Lemures, in which the malevolent and restless spirits of the dead were propitiated. Some liturgiologists base the idea that this \"Lemuria\" festival was the origin of that of All Saints on their identical dates and on the similar theme of \"all the dead\". Meanwhile, others consider that 13 May was perhaps deliberately chosen by the Pope because of its celebration already established in the East.\n\nThe feast of All Saints, on its current date, is traced to the foundation by Pope Gregory III (731–741) of an oratory in St. Peter's for the relics \"of the holy apostles and of all saints, martyrs and confessors, of all the just made perfect who are at rest throughout the world\", with the date moved to 1 November and 13 May feast suppressed.\n\nThis fell on the Celtic holiday of Samhain, which had a theme similar to the Roman festival of Lemuria, but which was also a harvest festival. The Irish, having celebrated Samhain in the past, did not celebrate All Hallows Day on this 1 November date, as extant historical documents attest that the celebration in Ireland took place in the spring: \"... the \"Felire\" of Oengus and the \"Martyrology of Tallaght\" prove that the early medieval churches [in Ireland] celebrated the feast of All Saints on 20 April.\"\n\nA November festival of all the saints was already widely celebrated on 1 November in the days of Charlemagne. It was made a day of obligation throughout the Frankish empire in 835, by a decree of Louis the Pious, issued \"at the instance of Pope Gregory IV and with the assent of all the bishops\", which confirmed its celebration on 1 November. The octave was added by Pope Sixtus IV (1471–1484).\n\nThe festival was retained after the Reformation in the calendar of the Anglican Church and in many Lutheran churches. In the Lutheran churches, such as the Church of Sweden, it assumes a role of general commemoration of the dead. In the Swedish calendar, the observance takes place on the Saturday between 31 October and 6 November. In many Lutheran Churches, it is moved to the first Sunday of November. In the Church of England, mother church of the Anglican Communion, it is a Principal Feast and may be celebrated either on 1 November or on the Sunday between 30 October and 5 November. It is also celebrated by other Protestants of the English tradition, such as the United Church of Canada, the Methodist churches and the Wesleyan Church.\n\nProtestants disagree with the idea of \"saints\" as understood in the Roman Catholic tradition, and generally commemorate all Christians on All Saints' Day; if they observe All Saints Day at all, they use it to remember all Christians both past and present. In the United Methodist Church, All Saints' Day is celebrated on the first Sunday in November. It is held, not only to remember Saints, but also to remember all those who have died who were members of the local church congregation. In some congregations, a candle is lit by the Acolyte as each person's name is called out by the clergy. Prayers and responsive readings may accompany the event. Often, the names of those who have died in the past year are affixed to a memorial plaque.\n\nIn many Lutheran churches, All Saints' Day is celebrated the Sunday after Reformation is celebrated (the date for Reformation is 31 October, so Reformation Sunday is celebrated on or before 31 October). In most congregations, the festival is marked as an occasion to remember the dead. The names of those who have died from the congregation within the last year are read during worship and a bell is tolled, a chime is played or a candle is lit for each name read. While the dead are solemnly remembered during worship on All Saints' Sunday, the festival is ultimately a celebration of Christ's victory over death.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, services often include the singing of the traditional hymn \"For All the Saints\" by Walsham How. The most familiar tune for this hymn is \"Sine Nomine\" by Ralph Vaughan Williams. Other hymns that are popularly sung during corporate worship on this day are \"I Sing a Song of the Saints of God\" and \"Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones\".\n\nIn some countries, All Saints' Day is a public holiday, but All Souls' Day is not. Consequently, people will visit the cemetery on All Saints. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Catholic parts of Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, and Sweden the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives.\n\nIn Austria and Bavaria it is customary on All Saints' Day for godfathers to give their godchildren \"Allerheiligenstriezel\", a braided yeast pastry.\n\nIn France, and throughout the Francophone world, the day is known as \"La Toussaint\". Flowers (especially in Chrysanthemums), or wreaths called 'couronnes de toussaints' are placed at each tomb or grave. The following day, 2 November (All Souls' Day) is called \"Le jour des morts\", the Day of the Dead. In Belgium, \"Toussaint\" is a public holiday. Belgians will visit the cemetery to place chrysanthemums on the graves of deceased relatives on All Saints Day since All Souls is not a holiday.\n\nIn Portugal, \"Dia de Todos os Santos\" is a national holiday. Families remember their dead with religious observances and visits to the cemetery. Portuguese children celebrate the \"Pão-por-Deus\" tradition (also called \"santorinho\", \"bolinho\" or \"fiéis de Deus\") going door-to-door, where they receive cakes, nuts, pomegranates, sweets and candies.\n\nIn Spain, el \"Día de Todos los Santos\" is a national holiday. The play \"Don Juan Tenorio\" is traditionally performed.\n\nIn Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay and the state of Louisiana, people take flowers to the graves of dead relatives. \n\nAll Saints' Day in Mexico coincides with the first day of the Day of the Dead (\"Día de Muertos\") celebration. It commemorates children who have died (\"Dia de los Inocentes\") and the second day celebrates all deceased adults.\n\nIn Guatemala, All Saints' Day is a national holiday. On that day Guatemalans make a special meal called \"fiambre\" which is made of cold meats and vegetables; it is customary to visit cemeteries and to leave some of the \"fiambre\" for their dead. It is also customary to fly kites to help unite the dead with the living. There are festivals in towns like Santiago Sacatepéquez and Sumpango, where giant colorful kites are flown.\n\nHallow-mas in the Philippines is variously called \"\"Undás\"\", \"\"Todos los Santos\"\" (Spanish, \"All Saints\"), and sometimes \"\"Araw ng mga Patay / Yumao\"\" (Tagalog, \"Day of the dead / those who have passed away\"), which actually refers to the following day of All Souls' Day but includes it. Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead to clean and repair their tombs. Offerings of prayers, flowers, candles, and even food, while Chinese Filipinos additionally burn incense and \"kim\". Many also spend the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the cemetery, having feasts and merriment.\n\nThough Halloween has usually been seen as an American influence in the Philippines, the country's trick-or-treat traditions during Undas (from the Spanish \"Hondras\") are actually much older. This tradition was derived from the pre-colonial tradition called pangangaluwa. Pangangaluluwa (from \"kaluluwa\" or spirit double) was a practice of early Filipinos who sang from house to house swathed in blankets pretending to be ghosts of ancestors. If the owner of the house failed to give biko or rice cakes to the \"nangangaluluwa\", the \"spirits\" would play tricks (try to steal slippers or other objects left outside the house by members of the family or run off with the owner's chickens). This pre-colonial practice is still seen in rural areas. During Undas, family members visit the cemetery where the body of the loved ones rest. It is believed that by going to the cemetery and offering food, candles, flowers, and sometimes incense sticks, the spirit of the loved one is remembered and appeased. Contrary to common belief, this visitation practice is not an imported tradition. Prior to the establishment of coffins, pre-colonial Filipinos were already practicing such a tradition of visiting burial caves throughout the archipelago as confirmed by a research conducted by the University of the Philippines. The tradition of \"atang\" or \"hain\" is also practiced, where food and other offerings are placed near the grave site. If the family cannot go to the grave site, a specific area in the house is provided for the offering. The exact date of Undas today, 1 November, is not a pre-colonial observance date but an influence from Mexico, where the same day is known as the Day of the Dead. Pre-colonial Filipinos preferred going to the burial caves of the departed occasionally as they believed that aswang (half-vampire half-werewolf beings) would take the corpse of the dead if the body was not properly guarded. The protection of the body of the loved one is called \"paglalamay\". However, in some communities, this paglalamay tradition is non-existent and is replaced by other pre-colonial traditions unique to each community. The Undas is also seen as a family reunion, where family members coming from various regions go back to their hometown to visit the grave of loved ones. Family members are expected to remain beside the grave for the entire day and socialize with each other to mend bonds and enhance family relations. In some cases, family members going to certain burial sites exceed one hundred people. Fighting in any form is prohibited during Undas. Children have important roles during Undas. Children are allowed to play with melted candles in front of grave sites and turn the melted wax from the candles into round wax balls. The round balls of wax symbolize the affirmation that everything goes back to where it began, as the living will go back to ash, where everything started. In some cases, families also light candles at the front door of the home. The number of candles is equivalent to the number of departed loved ones. It is believed that this tradition aids departed loved ones and provide them with a happy path to the afterlife.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7709600", "categories": ["Observances honoring the dead", "Public holidays in Croatia", "November observances", "Christian saints"], "title": "All Saints' Day"}

He grew up in the city's Riverdale district and graduated from high school in the city. On December 29, 1956 he married Clare Heller, with whom he would have four daughters.\n\nHe worked for the Dominion Bank from 1950 until 1959, and worked for his family's upholstering firm, Apex Auto Upholstering, from 1950 until 1988.\n\nPurves did not graduate from university, but has taken a variety of business and self-improvement courses.\n\nPurves' first bid for political office took place during the 1964 municipal election, when he ran unsuccessfully for Protestant school trustee. He finished eleventh of twenty-one candidates; the top seven were elected.\n\nHe ran for Edmonton City Council instead in the 1966 election, and was elected as one of twelve aldermen, finishing ninth of thirty-two candidates. He was re-elected in the 1968 election, finishing fifth out of thirty-two candidates. While still in office, he sought the Social Credit nomination in Edmonton-Strathcona for the 1971 provincial election, but was defeated by Strathcona Centre incumbent Joseph Donovan Ross (who was defeated in the general election by Progressive Conservative Julian Koziak).

Purves ran in Ward 2, and finished first out of eleven candidates.\n\nIn the 1974 election, Purves ran for mayor, challenging incumbent Ivor Dent. He defeated Dent, but so did William Hawrelak, who received more than twice as many votes as Purves. Hawrelak died in office and was replaced by alderman Terry Cavanagh, who Purves challenged for mayor in the 1977 election. In winning, he beat not only Cavanagh (who finished third) but Dent (who finished fourth) and future mayor Laurence Decore (who finished second). Purves faced no serious opposition to his 1980 re-election bid, and won more than seventy percent of the vote.\n\nThe highlight of Purves' terms as mayor were the 1978 Commonwealth Games and the accompanying opening of Commonwealth Stadium. As well, in 1979, Edmontonians voted to proceed with the construction of a convention centre, rejecting a ballot measure that would have halted the proposal. Purves was a public supporter of building the centre.\n\nPurves was defeated in the 1983 election by Decore, who received more than twice as many votes as the incumbent. He did not seek to re-enter politics thereafter.\n\nPurves served as a member of the St. Joseph's Hospital board, the Edmonton Police Commission, the Greater Edmonton Foundation board, the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce, and the Edmonton Symphony Society board.

It runs in a southwest-to-northeast direction, from the main gate of Naval Base Guam in the western community of Santa Rita in a general northeasterly direction to the main gate of Andersen Air Force Base in the community of Yigo. It passes through Guam's capital, Hagåtña, as well as intersecting various other territorial highways. Along its route, the highway runs through tropical forest areas, urbanized commercial areas, and residential neighborhoods. The US Military built the road starting in 1941. Construction ceased with the Japanese invasion in December 1941 and resumed in 1944. The highway was formally dedicated to the US Marines by the territorial governor in 2004.\n\nGH-1 begins near the entrance gate to Naval Base Guam, at a junction with GH-2A. Known as Marine Corps Drive, the route then travels to the northeast through tropical forests along Apra Harbor to the town of Piti. After passing through Piti, the drive runs along Tepungon Beach before turning inland near Asan Point. The road passes the US Naval Hospital and Asan Point; then it runs parallel to the coast along Asan Memorial Beach through the community of Asan. Soon thereafter, Marine Corps Drive cuts a path due east towards the Island's capital, Hagåtña where it passes through the northern edge of the city. In this area, GH-1 runs through commercial areas parallel to the West Agaña Beach Front area. The drive passes the Paseo de Susana before following Trinchera Beach northeasterly through town.\nAfter passing through the capital and the community of Mongmong, the road turns towards the northeast as it skirts to the west of Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on its way through the village of Tamuning. After the airport, the highway runs inland from the shoreline through the neighborhood of Tumon. It runs northeasterly around the Micronesia Mall before turning southeasterly through residential areas as it cuts across the southern edges of Dededo. It runs to the south of the Guam International Country Club and to the north of the Andersen Air Force Base's southern unit. Through this area, the north side of the highway is residential areas, and the south side is tropical forests. Marine Corps Drive passes the War Dead Cemetery and turns northeasterly residential areas on both sides of the roadway through Yigo before reaching its terminus at Salisbury Junction, the main entrance to the Air Force Base, where the road continues to the northwest as GH-9.\n\nLike most major highways on Guam, a speed limit is posted throughout most of its length. In the past, GH-1 was one of the few roads to post a limit on lengths of less-developed roadway. However, as more of the area became developed, certain sections of the roads were posted with lower limits. Travelers heading north away from the developed areas are allowed a speed limit. However, the southbound lanes on the same sections remain posted at due to development on the western side of the road.\n\nThe United States Military began to develop and construct roads on the island in 1941. Some roads had existed prior to this, but improvements were beginning to take shape. Only one road, which encircled most of the island, had been graded. It was the primary route linking Agana (the name of the capital at the time) to Piti and Asan. This was the foundation for Marine Corps Drive. After the Japanese invasion, little infrastructure improvements were made by the occupiers. Road construction resumed by the US Military after the island was invaded in 1944. In 60 days, a , four-lane super-highway with nine bridges was built after the invasion. The remainder of the roadway was built and numbered under the local administration after Guam was given civil government in 1950.\n\nNamed Marine Corps Drive throughout its length, it was known as simply Marine Drive until the road was rededicated by Governor Felix Perez Camacho in 2004. In 2012, the DPW has started to install LED streetlights along Marine Corps Drive.\n\n", "id": "7709715", "categories": ["Highways in Guam"], "title": "Guam Highway 1"}

It is the primary settlement in the town and had a population of 123 at the 2010 census. The village center and surrounding area are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Center Sandwich Historic District.\n\nThe village is home of the Sandwich Fair, held annually in early October.\n\nCenter Sandwich began as the site of an early gristmill, erected in 1768 by Daniel Beede, which was followed in 1780 by a sawmill, both on the banks of the Red Hill River. Roads were then built to the area, and the village and surrounding rural parts of town grew from about 900 people in 1790 to over 2,000 in 1820. Most of the village's development and growth occurred in the years before the Civil War, resulting in residential and civic buildings that are largely vernacular Federal and Greek Revival in style. Because no railroads were built to serve the area, Center Sandwich declined in importance after the Civil War. Only a small number of changes occurred in the village in the 20th century. The oldest surviving building in the village is the 1792 Baptist church, originally Federal in style, but later given Greek Revival features.\n\nThe CDP is in the south-central part of the town of Sandwich, at the intersection of New Hampshire Route 113 and Route 109. Route 113 leads southwest along the north side of Squam Lake to Holderness and leads east to Tamworth. Route 109 begins in Center Sandwich and travels southeast to Moultonborough and to Wolfeboro.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Center Sandwich CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.1%, are water.\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 123 people, 63 households, and 33 families residing in the CDP. There were 89 housing units, of which 26, or 29.2%, were vacant. 15 of the vacant units were for seasonal or recreational use.

After studying first in Helsinki (where he was a student of Fredrik Johan Wiik), then in Stockholm and Heidelberg, Sederholm returned to Finland to work for the Geological Survey of Finland. In 1893 he assumed the role of director of this institution, a post he occupied until his death forty years later.\n\nWorking on local Precambrian basement rocks, Sederholm instigated a map-making programme that, between 1899 and 1925, published many maps and descriptions of their geological history. Gneisses in the areas he studied (the so-called Baltic Shield) were often of mixed composition, with layers of granitic rock being interleaved with metamorphic rock. Sederholm termed these as migmatites, and viewed them as the product of the intrusion of igneous magma into metamorphic rocks at depth.\n\nDuring his career Sederholm received both the Murchison Medal from the Geological Society of London (1928) and the Penrose Medal from the Geological Society of America (also 1928). The mineral sederholmite is named in his honour.\n\nAside from his geological work, Sederholm was a member of the Diet of Finland, and undertook missions from this to the League of Nations. He was also a member and chairman (twice) of the Economic Society of Finland.\n\nIn the 1974 historical novel \"Centennial\", James Michener listed Sederholm among those scientists who made early estimates of the age of the Earth.

He started working for the Medellín Cartel and ultimately led its militia wing. After internal vendettas he became one of Pablo Escobar's many enemies and became part of Los Pepes, an organization headed by the Castaño brothers, Carlos and Fidel. The organization controlled a powerful gang of hitmen named \"La Terraza\" (The Terrace). He then commanded two paramilitary blocs, the Cacique Nutibara Bloc and the Granada Heroes Bloc.\n\nHe became third in the chain of command of the AUC and a key player during the peace process in Santa Fe de Ralito, Córdoba between his organization and the government of Colombia, until he was accused by a court of being responsible for the death of a deputy. He then escaped from Santa Fe de Ralito and surrendered to authorities four days later.\n\nIn the early morning of May 13, 2008, Murillo Bejarano and 13 other paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the Colombian government. According to Colombian Interior Minister Carlos Holguín, they refused to comply with the country's Peace and Justice law and were therefore extradited to the United States. Many critics argued that this action would actually be favorable to the criminal as he would only be charged for drug trafficking in the United States, as opposed to being charged for his many murders and other illegal activities in Colombia. The next day, Don Berna pleaded innocent to money laundering and drug trafficking charges filed by United States (federal) prosecutors of the Southern District of New York State. The judge ruled the trial would begin September 16, 2008.\n\nOn June 17, 2008, he pleaded guilty to trafficking tons of cocaine.\n\nThe National Movement of State Crimes, a coalition of several organizations of victims who suffered from state or paramilitary violence, has asked for the \"return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the Law of Justice and Peace, since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims, since they have not told all of the truth, have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims, and have not dismantled their criminal structures\".\n\nThe Office in Colombia of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated: \"according to Colombian law, the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previously-suspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the 'Law of Justice and Peace' and for the loss of the benefits established therein\".\n\nThe Inter-American Commission stated that this \"affects the Colombian State's obligation to guarantee victims’ rights to truth, justice, and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups. The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice system's regular criminal procedures. It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict, and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused. This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders.\"\n\n\n", "id": "7709779", "categories": ["Living people", "1961 births", "Members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia", "Colombian drug traffickers"], "title": "Diego Murillo Bejarano"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709786", "text": "French ship Bretagne (1855)\n\nThe Bretagne was a fast 130-gun three-decker of the French Navy, designed by engineer Jules Marielle. Built as a new capital ship meant to improve upon the very successful \"Océan\" class while avoiding the weaknesses found on \"Valmy\", she retained most of the \"Océan\" design but ended up incorporating the philosophy of \"fast ship of the line\" pioneered by \"Napoléon\", with a rounded stern and a two-cylinder, 8-boiler steam engine allowing her a speed of 13.5 knots. The propeller could be retracted to streamline the hull when sailing under sail only.\n\nShe was launched in 1855 and was too late to take part in the Crimean War. She was decommissioned in 1865, becoming a schoolship for boys and sailors in Brest. Struck from the Navy lists in 1880, she was broken up the same year.\n\n\"Bretagne\" was the offspring of an attempt to improve upon the \"Océan\" class by increasing the beam from 16.24 to 16.64 metres.\n\nThe 1849 budget initially allowed for construction of a new three-decker capital ship named \"Terrible\" in Brest, but the ship was cancelled in 1848 to slim down expenses. The 1850 budget then scheduled two ships, named \"Bretagne\" and \"Desaix\" (in honour of Louis Desaix), to be built in Brest and Cherbourg respectively; the order was placed on 15 March 1851. The mediocre performances of \"Valmy\" during her trials led to the Navy shedding the capital ship design of the Commission de Paris and start back from Sané's \"Océan\" design, with only incremental modifications. In late 1851, engineers De Gasté, responsible for \"Bretagne\", and Forquenot, for \"Desaix\", decided on a reduction of the tumblehome by 20 centimetres and on a slight increase of the beam — alterations thought safe, as the two last ships of the \"Océan\" design, \"Ville de Paris\" and \"Louis-XIV\", had had their tumblehome reduced by 23 centimetres with no ill effect. An initial suggestion to fit the ships with 160 shp steam engines allowing for a speed of 4,5 knots was declined as to minimise departures from Sané's design.\n\"Bretagne\" was laid down on 4 August 1851 and \"Desaix\" on 27 Octobre. On 17 June 1852, the Ministry of the Navy suspended construction and required that the ships be lengthened by 3.43 metres and that 540 shp steam engines be incorporated. Brest responded to the requirements in September 1852, but at the same point, Dupuy de Lôme's fast ship of the line \"Napoléon\" was completing her trials, exhibiting such outstanding performances that on 10 September 1852 the Ministry cancelled the \"Bretagne\" class and ordered existing sailing ships to be converted to steamers, using as many existing parts as possible. At this point, the keel, bow and aft of \"Bretagne\" had been erected, amounting to the third of the 24 construction steps defined by regulations in ship construction; she was taken apart and rebuilt according to Marielle's plans, which had been approved in December 1852. At the same time, the order for the steam engine was placed. \"Desaix\", whose keel was only beginning to be laid, was cancelled altogether and \"Arcole\", second ship of the \"Algésiras\" type, the production series of the \"Napoléon\" design, was started instead.\n\nLaunching of \"Bretagne\" took place on 17 February 1855; in spite of a 2 °C, snow and strong wind, a large populace gathered to watch the operation.\n\nThe new design gave a length of 81 metres and a beam of 18.08; this made \"Bretagne\" 8 metres longer and 2 metres wider than \"Napoléon\". With a draught of 8.35 metre, the ship had a volume of just under 20 000 m³. The engine, provided by the Indret workshop, occupied a 30-metre long compartment and was designed for 1200 shp but could develop up to 3327 shp in peak power from eight boilers, each with six furnaces. Though direct transmission by an axis, it moved a four-blade, 6.3-metre propeller which could be retracted into a vertical shaft, only 1.3 metre wide thanks to the geometry of the blades. The ship carried 590 tonnes of coal, giving her an autonomy of 14 days at 10 knots, and 6 days at her top speed of 14 knots. With three month worth of food for the 1200-man complement, and one month worth fresh water completed by a distillation device to desalinate seawater, she could stay at sea for 40 days.\n\nThe main battery of \"Bretagne\" used 36-pounder long guns, the heaviest available calibre, instead of the more modern 30-pounder long gun on which other ships standardised their armament. The aft of the ship was round and featured gun ports, like on \"Napoléon\" on her successors. Although she carried 130 guns of various calibres, \"Bretagne\" featured no less than 180 gun ports; this allowed the crew to reinforce the artillery on one arc if needed and time permitting, such as before a shore bombardment, and fire up to 80 guns on one target.\n\nThe figurehead figured the prophet Veleda, an important character in the folklore of Bretagne, with a sickle in hand and a wearing an oak leaf crown. The transom featured the coat of arms of Bretagne, carried by two geniī, and the name of the ship underneath. The ship was painted in black, with white stripes along the level of the gunports and copper-red paint underwater.\n\nAs completed, \"Bretagne\" proved much heavier than anticipated: designed to displace 6466 tonnes for an 8.20-metre draught, she actually displaced 6873, yielding a 9-metre draught that lowered the lower battery to only 1.45 above water, instead of the intended 1.75 metres.\nThe ultimate increase in French capital ship design, \"Bretagne\" increased the number of heavy guns on the lower battery to 18 on each side, from the 15 of the \"Bretagne\" of 1766 and 16 on the \"Océan\"s. In the original design, half of these guns were 36-pounder long guns, as to maximise firepower at the price of standardisation on 30-pounder long guns that typically prevailed at the time, the other half being 60-pounder Paixhans guns. The middle deck fielded 18 30-pounder short guns and another 18 Paixhans guns of 60 pounds. The upper battery was armed with 38 30-pounder howitzers. Two 50-pounders and 18 30-pounder caronades complemented the armament on the deck. This gave \"Bretagne\" a broadside of 2924 pounds (1431 kilogrammes), compared to the 2400 of the original \"Océan\" design.\n\nIn 1869, after the ship became a school ship for the École Navale, this armament was replaced with 2 rifled 19 cm guns on the lower deck; 16 30-pounder guns, 4 riffled 16-centimetre guns of the 1864 pattern, 8 riffled 16-centimetre guns modified after the 1860 or the 1862 pattern, 2 muzzle-loading 16-centimetre riffled guns, and 2 14-centimetre guns on the middle battery; and 2 bronze 12-centimetre guns on the deck.\n\nCompleted two years after her British homologue HMS \"Duke of Wellington\", \"Bretagne\" became the most powerful warship in the world, but commissioned too late to effectively take part in the Crimean War, which was almost over after the fall of Kinburn in October 1855. Appointed flagship of the Toulon squadron in January 1856, she sailed to the Black Sea to serve during the last months of the conflict, which came to an end in July, and helped return the French expeditionary corps back to France. She was then part of the training squadron in Toulon, cruising between Sardinia and Spain.\n\"Bretagne\" took part in the naval parade given in honour of Queen Victoria by Napoléon III in Cherbourg Roads on 5 August 1858. The French Emperor intended to prove to the British that the recent improvements to Cherbourg military harbour were not meant as a threat to Great Britain, and invited the British monarch, Prince Albert and a large British delegation to visit the installations, as a token of good faith. The visit was counter-productive, as the display of power of the French fleet, compounded by bouts of diplomatic clumsiness such as inaugurating an equestrian statue of Napoléon I, irritated and worried the British. After the British delegation departed in haste, \"Bretagne\" took the French Emperor and Empress aboard and ferried them to Brest for the next leg of their official tour.\n\n\"Bretagne\" served as a troopship during the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, and a few months later the led the bombing of Tétouan forts in Morocco, where a cannonball hit her hull. In 1860, she sailed to Napoli for the funeral of Prince Jérôme Napoléon. She then sailed to Gaeta in October, under Admiral Adelbert Lebarbier de Tinan, to oppose a Sardinian attack against Napolitan forces, leading to the Battle of Garigliano. She spend most of 1861 ferrying French troops deployed in Syria back to France, before returning to Toulon.\n\nIn 1865, \"Bretagne\" was transformed into a schoolship for boys and sailors, leading to the removal of her engine. In 1869, the artillery was replaced by an assortment of various types of guns for didactic purpose. The 30-gun corvette \"Galathée\" served as her tender. On 28 January 1880, \"Bretagne\" was struck for the Navy lists and renamed to \"Ville de Bordeaux\", exchanging her name and equipment with \"Ville de Bordeaux\", and was towed to Landévennec to be broken up.\n\n\n", "id": "7709786", "categories": ["Ships of the line of the French Navy", "Ships built in France", "1855 ships"], "title": "French ship Bretagne (1855)"}

There is one pub, the \"George & Dragon\".\n\nThere is a preschool and a primary school (Five Lanes CE VC Primary School) which has two sites: for younger children at Potterne and for older children in the nearby village of Worton.\n\nPotterne Cricket Club, founded as part of the village sports team in 1936, play in the West of England Premier League and Wiltshire County Cricket League.\n\nThe village is home to the Potterne Mummers, who re-enact performances of a traditional mummers play during the week before Christmas in pubs around the Devizes area and ending each year with a performance at the George and Dragon and Potterne social club on Christmas Eve. The Mummers were founded in 1953 by Bernard Baker, a local schoolteacher, who brought together a group to perform a local mummer's play which he had found from an archive report from the late nineteenth century. The initial revival of the play only lasted one year; it was performed by Potterne teenagers under the direction of Bernard Baker. In 1976 the cast included Nigel Weeks as Valiant Soldier, and it was next performed in 1972, with a cast which included Mick Hiscock. It has been performed every year since and is a firm annual tradition and the cast, still including Mick Hiscock, put on their tatter coats and tour the pubs collecting money for various charities including the Wiltshire Air Ambulance.\n\nThe Potterne Mummers were presented to Prince Philip in 2012 at the Queen's Jubilee event at Salisbury Cathedral and were shortlisted for a Community Service award in 2014.\n\nA medieval part of what is now Potterne was the manor of Blount's Court, which probably originated in the 13th century. By 1953, the house and property now known as Blount's Court had been owned by the Stancomb family since 1809, when William Stancomb started building the house, for which he revived the ancient name. His son William died in 1941 at the age of 90. Blount's Court, which is now divided into flats, is a large 19th Century 'gothic' building with a porch carried up as a battlemented tower. The centre block is of three stories, the wings are of two. The windows are squareheaded, mullioned, and transomed, the parapets battlemented.

The principal reason for such clauses is to minimise conflict between the insured and the insurer. The insurer will often wish to settle claims as quickly and cheaply as possible, but the insured may be concerned that paying on a claim implies negligence which will damage their professional reputation, and want to contest the claim regardless. Professional indemnity policies commonly provide that the insurer will pay the legal costs of the defence. It is sometimes suggested that the clause is also designed to protect the public from the unjustified contesting of claims which have no real defence, but this may represent a charitable view of the way insurance companies conduct claims.\n\nConflicts between the insurer and insured can put a solicitor who represents both in an invidious position, particularly where the solicitor has received confidential information from one party, and may result in multiplicity of legal representation. In practice however, there is an enormous reluctance to invoke such clauses, partly because of the expense of instructing Queen's Counsel to advise, and partly because of the insurer's need to maintain good relations with the insured.\n\nAlthough still called QC clauses, such clauses often provide that the advice of a junior barrister of a certain seniority may be taken.\n\nSome general liability policies contain a converse version the traditional QC clause; viz., that the insurer does not need to pay out on a claim against the insured \"unless\" a Queen's Counsel advises that there is no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the claim.\n\nQC clauses were considered judicially by Lord Devlin (in relation to another issue) in \"West Wake Price & Co v Ching\" [1956] 3 All ER 821.\n", "id": "7709841", "categories": ["Contract clauses", "Insurance law", "English law"], "title": "QC clause"}

They were independent of Haeckel's philosophical speculations but took his ideas in a positive way to widen their concepts in zoology. Initially, between 1879–1883, they worked together and performed embryological studies, especially on the theory of the coelom (1881). These problems were based on the phylogenetic theorems of Haeckel, specifically, the \"biogenic theory\" () and the \"gastraea theory\" of Haeckel.\n\nWithin 10 years, the two brothers moved apart to the north and south of Germany. Richard's brother Oscar later became a professor of anatomy in 1888 in Berlin; however, Richard Hertwig had moved 3 years prior, becoming a professor of zoology in Munich from 1885–1925, at Ludwig Maximilians University, where he served the last 40 years of his 50-year career as a professor at 4 universities.\n\nThe later research of Richard Hertwig focused on protists (with the relationship between the nucleus and the plasma = \"Kern-Plasma-Relation\"), as well as on developmental physiological studies on sea urchins and frogs. Richard Hertwig also wrote a leading textbook of zoology, published in 1891, which he kept up to date through 15 editions until 1931.\n\nHertwig was born in Friedberg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. He began studying medicine at the University of Jena, and under the influence of professor Ernst Haeckel (16 years older), he shifted his interest more to zoology and biology.\nIn 1872, he received a doctorate at the University of Bonn and worked there as an assistant to anatomist Max Schultze. In 1875, he moved to the University of Jena in the Department of Zoology, and in 1878, Hertwig became extraordinary professor there.\n\nAs a successor of Franz Hermann Troschel, Richard Hertwig was appointed in 1881 to the University of Königsberg as a professor of zoology. In 1883, he moved to the same role as professor at the University of Bonn, where he remained only a short while, however, since in 1885, he was called to the Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich, where Hertwig remained until 1925, also working as head of the zoological collection of the state of Bavaria (now Zoologische Staatssammlung München) and as director of the zoological institute which he developed into a leading centre of biological science.\n\nHertwig belonged to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, beginning in 1885 as an extraordinary member, and from 1889 as a full member. In 1909, he received the title Ritter von.\n\nHertwig died on 3 October 1937 in Schlederloh, Germany.\n\nHis pupil Otto Koehler became one of the founders of Ethology in Germany. Another of his students, Ivan Buresh, was a leading Bulgarian natural scientist. His student Rhoda Erdmann was well-known for her studies of invertebrates and cancer and was a pioneer in the field of tissue culture. She founded and led the Institute of Experimental Cytology at the University of Berlin. She also was the founder and editor of the journal \"\"Archiv fur Experimentelle Zellforschung\".\" \n\nAt the beginning of his career, Richard Hertwig worked along with his brother, Oscar Hertwig.\nTogether they developed, in 1881, the Coelom Theory (German: \"\"Coelomtheorie\"\"), of the fluid-filled body cavity (the \"coelom\"), as an explanation of the middle Keimblatt, which brought important realizations in the field of embryology.\nThe theory assumes that all organs and tissues develop differently from three primary tissue layers, during animal embryogenesis.\n\nHertwig worked systematically on several groups of protozoa and metazoa (German: \"Wirbellose\") and provided fundamental work on the development of animals. His contributions are most well known to protozoa research.\n\nHertwig, on the basis of examining sea urchins, discovered and explained the zygote fertilization process for the first time correctly as a fusion of egg and spermatozoon (sperm cell) penetrating the egg membrane.\n\n\n", "id": "7709864", "categories": ["Bavarian nobility", "University of Bonn alumni", "Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art", "Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences", "People from Friedberg, Hesse", "Recipients of the Pour le Mérite (civil class)", "German biologists", "1850 births", "German zoologists", "German Fatherland Party politicians", "People from the Grand Duchy of Hesse", "University of Königsberg faculty", "1937 deaths", "University of Bonn faculty"], "title": "Richard Hertwig"}

The author's main observation is that most of da Vinci's work was unfinished. Through a thorough research, the author dismisses most of the romanticized facts about da Vinci and concludes that a lot is unknown about the genius inventor. Da Vinci is described as an engineer obsessed with natural designs. \"Washington Post\" writer Alexander Nagel criticized Nicholl's technical analysis of the inventor's paintings that lack insight and misses an opportunity to push deeper into the mind of da Vinci.\n\nThe author retranslates many of da Vinci's mirrorscript writings. Some guesswork is admittedly thrown in this biography: an old woman visiting da Vinci in 1493 becomes his mother; Freudian concepts are used to explain his probable homosexuality (Joseph missing from his representations of the Holy Family); His stay in jail is linked to his plans to reverse engineer locks... The author also argues that da Vinci's obsession with flying devices comes from his alchemical quest for a levitation technology.\n\nDavid Gelernter criticized his interpretations around the hypothetical encounter of Michelangelo and da Vinci.\n\nThe release of \"Leonardo da Vinci: Flights of the Mind\" coincided with the release of another da Vinci biography, \"Leonardo\" by Martin Kemp.\n\n", "id": "7709883", "categories": ["2004 non-fiction books", "Art history books"], "title": "Leonardo da Vinci: The Flights of the Mind"}

Dr. Crawford-Brown, in her publication \"Who will save our children: The plight of the Jamaican child in the nineties\", showed that these children have surrogate parents who are often unable to give them the emotional support and nurturance that they need, most of these children may be instead raised by grandparents or close relatives.\n\nThe impact on these children of this type of neglect includes a range of emotional and behavioural problems including run-away behaviour, withdrawal, depression, and, in some cases, acting-out behaviour. The Trinidad and Tobago News said that for \"barrel children the psychological scars have been great and have been troubling factors unto the second, third and fourth generations.\"\n\nThe Wellcome Trust discussed barrel children in an article focusing on violence in the Caribbean while it was the title and subject of a short film by Cara Elmslie Weir about a Trinidadian family split by migration, the parents \"sending barrels full of material goods\" from the US to their children in Trinidad.\n\nUNICEF in Jamaica agreed that \"Migration of parents who seek more lucrative employment abroad has had a negative impact on Jamaican children. Some children are left in the care of strangers, neighbours or even older siblings who are still children. These so-called “barrel children” are left without parental guidance or adult supervision and with access to significant material resources in the form of cash remittances and barrels of clothing and toys sent by absentee parents.\"\n\nIt has also been discussed in Caribbean Studies Journals, conferences on the Caribbean, the Trinidad Guardian and Trinidad Newsday. Discussing absent parents The Trinidad Guardian noted that \"At holiday time, they ship their barrels of love, disguised as brand-name sneakers and clothing, believing that these would make their children happy and make up for them being not around. But the fact remains that children are deprived of the real love of their parents.\"\n\nAn article published in \"Newsweek\" by Brook Larmar entitled the \"Barrel Children\" dramatised the problem in its effects on one particular family. \"The cardboard barrel has been sitting empty in Marsha Flowers's backyard for more than a month now, but the Jamaican teenager hangs onto it as though it were a sacred totem. And in a way, it is. Five years after her mother immigrated to the United States, leaving Marsha and two sisters to fend for themselves in a Kingston slum, the barrel is one of the few tangible signs of her mother's love - and of her own frustrated desires.\"\n\nBlogs also exist highlighting the experiences of barrel children. Memories of a Caribbean Barrel Child was created by Dr. Anthony Salandy (a native of Trinidad and Tobago) to shed light of the experiences and outcomes associated with being a barrel child.\n", "id": "7709896", "categories": ["Parenting", "Developmental psychology"], "title": "Barrel children"}

The University of Illinois offered him a scholarship, but Brown chose instead to attend Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. In 1966, he represented Bermuda at the Commonwealth Games, reaching the second round of the 400-yard dash. As a student leader, he was a vocal figure during the Washington riots, speaking alongside campus activists and Black Panther leaders such as Stokely Carmichael. In 1968, Brown led a coalition of Howard University campus political organizations in a successful five-day takeover of the school's administration building. It was the first all-black seizure of a college administration building in the United States.\n\nBrown decided to continue his education and become a doctor. He earned an M.D. from Howard's College of Medicine, and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a Master of Public Health from the University of California. His key areas of study included family medicine, population control and international health. Brown remained in Los Angeles, acquiring US citizenship and opening a medical practice, the Vermont Century Medical Clinic, in 1974.\n\nIn 1974 he became the first qualified doctor in 50 years to be turned down for a Bermuda Medical license to practice after failing the registration exam. Brown alleged that the powers that be deliberately gave him a failing grade for political reasons. He eventually received his license to practice in 1988, and set up Bermuda Healthcare Services in 1990, returning to the island permanently in 1993.\n\nBrown became a director for the Marcus Garvey School, a K-8 school in Los Angeles, which named him Humanitarian of the Year in 1991. Brown has served as a trustee of both Howard University and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, and Assistant Professor of Drew University's Department of Family Practice. Brown is a former member of the Board of Directors of Marina Hills Hospital in Los Angeles, California; a former member of the California State Commission on Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health; and a founding Commissioner of the Board of Prevention Commissioners for South Central Los Angeles Regional Centre for Development Disabilities.\n\nHe was a founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors for Western Park Hospital in Los Angeles, California and served as Director of Quality Assurance for the Los Angeles Doctor's Hospital; Chairman of the Minority Group Affairs of the Student American Medical Association and as a Coordinator of the Summer Health Task Force of the National Urban Coalition in Washington D.C.; as Chairman of the Utilization Review Committee, West Adams Hospital, Los Angeles, California; and as Secretary of the Charles R Drew Medical Society in Los Angeles.\n\nBrown has been honored for his service to medicine and for his humanitarian and philanthropic efforts. He was recognized twice by Howard University's College of Medicine for distinguished service to the college. He received the Physicians Recognition Award in 1977 from the American Medical Association; the Grassroots Health Award from the Sons of Watts California in 1979; the Dubois Academic Institute's Community Leadership Award in 1982; the Pacesetter Award from the NAACP in 1984; Humanitarian of the Year Award from the Marcus Garvey School in Los Angeles in 1991; and in 1993, the Scroll Award from the Union of American Physicians and Dentists.\n\nAt the urging of then-PLP leader L. F. Wade, Brown returned to Bermuda and became involved in local politics in 1993 to run as a candidate for the Opposition Progressive Labour Party. That year, he ran as a PLP candidate for one of the two Warwick West constituency's seats in the House of Assembly, facing the two incumbent UBP members of parliament: Quinton Edness and Sir John Sharpe, the former Premier. Brown finished only two votes behind Edness, unseating Sharpe by 14 votes. In Opposition, Brown first served as Shadow Minister for Youth and Sports and in 1995 became Shadow Minister for Human Affairs. \n\nIn the following general election in 1998, Brown again won one of the Warwick West seats, and was joined by El James during the PLP's historic victory over the UBP ending 30 years of United Bermuda Party rule. Brown was appointed the PLP's first Minister of Transport by Premier Jennifer Smith.\n\nAs Minister of Transport, Brown oversaw the public bus system, taxis, marine ports and ferries, vehicle licensing, and aviation. He introduced a number of reforms, including the completion of the oppositions plan for the replacement of the island's obsolescent ferries with faster, 205-seat catamarans, the \"Serenity\" and the \"Resolute\", in 2002. In May of that year, he clashed with the taxi industry over his proposed legislation to require a GPS-based central despatching system, which was eventually passed into law four years later.\n\nAir arrivals at Bermuda International Airport increased by 15 percent between 2003–2007, largely due to the introduction of low cost airline service in 2004, reversing a twenty-year decline from the 1980s. While James G. Howes was the general manager, the Bermuda International Airport was recognized as the best in the North American region for overall passenger satisfaction for both 2002 and 2003, as well as ninth in the world in 2002, for which the Brown threw a party for all of the airport employees and their families.\n\nIn October 2008, however, the Department of Statistics announced that visitor arrivals had plunged from the previous year to their second lowest level since 1980, saying \"Air arrivals during the second quarter of 2008 [April–June] fell 10 percent compared to the same quarter last year... The number of visitors stood at 89,642 persons, representing the second lowest second quarter visitor total since 1980.\"\n\nCruise ship calls also declined from 181 in 2007, to 122 in 2008. In mid-2008, Brown put additional tourism promotional emphasis in the New York market (Bermuda's largest), resulting in a 27% increase in New York arrivals for December 2008 compared to December 2007, officials said. Overall, December 2008 arrivals were almost 7% higher than December 2007. The government projected 300,000 cruise visitors in 2009.\n\nIn 2004, Brown clashed with the US Consulate over what was alleged to be a \"gross violation\" of security at the Bermuda International Airport, when he was said to have avoided security screening procedures. Brown denied the claim, and criticized the consulate for making the issue public.\n\nFollowing the PLP's second general election victory on 23 July 2003, Brown and ten PLP MPs refused to support PLP Leader Jennifer Smith as premier. She resigned on 28 July 2003, and following a special leadership conference of the PLP, William Alexander Scott was elected as leader of the party and premier. Brown was elected as Deputy Leader of Party and Deputy Premier of Bermuda. Responding to criticism that the leadership challenge was launched after the voters had already gone to the polls, Brown responded, \"We had to mislead you.\" A compromise between the factions of the party led to Smith being replaced by William Alexander Scott and Brown being named Deputy Premier, and later adding the Ministry of Tourism to his portfolio.\n\nBrown never made a secret of his aspiration to lead Bermuda, telling a Howard University reporter in 2006, \"I always wanted to seek the leadership of my country and I'm still in that process.\" On 12 October 2006, Brown resigned from cabinet to make a second bid for leadership. At a previously scheduled party delegates conference on the evening of 27 October, he defeated the incumbent, Scott, by 107 to 76, and was sworn in as Premier on 30 October. In a subsequent interview with the Bermuda \"Sun\", he said, \"I have worked hard, studied hard, and prepared for the task of leadership to the best of the abilities that God has given me.\"\n\nWhen he reshuffled the cabinet, he reclaimed the tourism and transportation portfolios and became, in addition to Premier, the Minister of Tourism and Transport. Since then, the Bermuda Government has made a number of proposals, issuing a \"Vision Statement: Taking Bermuda to the next level\". Current issues include indigent medical care, traffic congestion, environmental concerns over development and waste disposal, race relations, and independence.\n\nOn a private member bill concerning sexual orientation, Brown rejected the proposal, saying \"I firmly believe in the right of all and any individuals to be free from discrimination in any form. However, I would not support the proposed Human Rights Amendment. I do not believe that there is a need for special protection of persons in Bermuda based on their sexual orientation\". In April 2007, the government proposed restrictions on vehicle ownership, intended to curb Bermuda's growing road congestion problem. Among the solutions offered are free travel on buses and ferries. \"There are too many cars in Bermuda. We must find a way – perhaps unpopular to many and disdained by others – to arrest the increase of cars on our beautiful island\", he said.\n\nPolls in 2007 and 2008 indicated that two-thirds of the island's voters remain opposed to severing ties for various reasons, including loss of EU-status (which Bermuda currently has as a British overseas territory). Undaunted, Premier Brown said \"I am firmly committed to Bermuda becoming an independent nation.\" He has also spurned any participation in Whitehall's selection of the Governor of Bermuda, saying, \"We want to clarify our position that we are not interested in sending any criteria for any future governors for selection for the reason we don't think it is our responsibility. [The British government] should send whoever they want to send.\"\n\nOn 2 November 2007, following the reading of the Throne Speech by Governor John Vereker, Premier Brown set 18 December 2007 as the date for Bermuda's general election. During the election campaign, the PLP government held a joint press conference with the Bermuda Police Service on 12 December 2007, where it was revealed that a bullet had been mailed to the Premier and was being viewed as a serious and credible threat. A police investigation was unable to determine the originator of the threat.\n\nRace relations continue to be a vexing issue in Bermuda, occasionally leading to heated exchanges with the press and the opposition UBP in Parliament. Brown rejected inappropriate questions as \"plantation questions\". He later explained, \"A plantation question is for me a question which conjures up images of the plantation: of a master-servant relationship, a man-boy relationship. A question that would be asked of a black politician and not a white one. I will continue to indicate to reporters if that is what a question is.\"\n\nResponding to opposition criticism of his wife's fund-raising activities voiced in the House of Assembly, he bristled, \"Mr. Speaker, I have never had plans to cross this aisle, but in recent weeks that Honourable Member has said a few things that would encourage me to do so. I say to that Honourable Member that I would like to stay on this side of the House and not have come to the other side because it wouldn't be in order to vote for the UBP.\"\n\nOn 7 October 2008, Ricardo M. Urbina, a United States federal judge, ordered the immediate release of seventeen Chinese Uighurs from Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp (the Uighur detainees in Guantanamo). The United States had previously determined that the Uighurs were never terrorists, and it no longer considered them enemy combatants. Judge Urbina ruled that their detention is illegal because their indefinite detention was without cause.\n\nThe United States continued to detain the Uighurs, believing their lives would be in danger if they were released to China. There was considerable political pressure from members of Congress not to release the Uighurs in the United States, and the United States had a difficult time finding another country willing to accept them. Eventually, the Republic of Palau announced that it would accept the remaining Uighurs on a temporary basis.\n\nIn June 2009, Brown announced that he had secretly made a deal with the United States to accept four of the Uighurs, who arrived on the island over-night, on humanitarian grounds; he also promised to make them Bermudian nationals (\"see also: Belonger status\"). The agreement to accept the Uighurs angered the government of the United Kingdom, which was deliberately not informed about the proposed agreement.\n\nThe government of the United Kingdom maintains that it has the authority over the acceptance of the Uighurs because agreements between Bermuda and foreign nations are strictly under the United Kingdom's control; the government of Bermuda responded that the acceptance of the Uighurs is an immigration case and, thus, an internal matter.\n\nThe decision was kept secret from Brown's Cabinet (Deputy Premier Paula Cox claimed she had been \"politically neutered\"), the Governor and the Bermuda Police Service, which would be responsible for any security concerns.\n\nThe Opposition UBP tabled a motion of no confidence against Brown the next day, saying that the premier's actions violated the Constitution of Bermuda and bordered on dictatorship; Brown responded by saying that the \"firestorm\" \"would pass\" and that his position was not in danger, but that he regretted the response to his actions. The following week, a protest march was organised by a PLP member to oppose Brown's continuing premiership, which was dismissed by Brown.\n\nBrown had initially stated he only intended to serve one term as premier and announced to a party conference in October 2008 that he intended to step down as party leader and premier in October 2010. Fulfilling that campaign promise, Brown stepped down in October 2010. He was succeeded as leader of the PLP on 28 October 2010 by Paula Cox and in a by-election held on 14 December 2010 was succeeded as MP for Warwick South Central by PLP MP Marc Bean.\n\nBrown initially refused to provide testimony to the Commission of Inquiry under Sir Anthony Evans in October 2016. Brown's evidence will be called again in November '16 to answer questions arising from the Auditor General's report of financial irregularities during Brown's term in government.\n\nPolice Investigation\n\nOn February 11, 2017 the Bermuda Police Service raided Dr. Brown's Bermuda businesses as part of their ongoing investigation into corruption and fraud.\n\nHe owns two medical clinics, Bermuda Healthcare Services in Paget Parish and the Brown-Darrell Clinic in Smith's Parish, which could receive more than $1.2 million from taxpayers as compensation for the cuts in fees for medical scans imposed by the One Bermuda Alliance administration in 2017, said to be contrary to the advice of the Bermuda Health Council.\n\n", "id": "7709979", "categories": ["Premiers of Bermuda", "Howard University alumni", "Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda) politicians", "1946 births", "UCLA School of Public Health alumni", "Living people", "Deputy Premiers of Bermuda"], "title": "Ewart Brown"}

He married Anita de la Guerra de Noriega y Carrillo, of the locally prominent de la Guerra family of Santa Barbara. The marriage party is described by Richard Henry Dana, Jr., in \"Two Years Before the Mast\".\n\nAfter the Mexican Cession, and California was annexed by the U.S. in 1848 and became a state in 1850, Robinson worked for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and as a land manager during the 1850s through the 1880s.\n\nIn 1868 he formed the Robinson Trust with Abel Stearns, the most important land owner in Southern California in Los Angeles County. The real estate sales partnership included four San Francisco investors; Samuel Brannan, E. F. Northam, Charles B. Polhemus, Edward Martin. The era of the large cattle ranchos was on the way out. In its place came agriculture, as ranchos were broken up and generally sold in farms and ranches. The Trust acted as sales agents for the subdivisions.

The fuzes use two sensors. The first, an acoustic sensor, arms the mine as a helicopter approaches. The second sensor is a radar, which locates the target and triggers the mine at the appropriate point. The mines all use a number of large Misznay Schardin effect warheads to project large numbers of fragments to an effective range of around 200 meters. \"Jane's Mines and Mine Clearance\" speculates that IFF could be integrated into the fuze circuit to discriminate against friendly aircraft, lowering the chances of friendly fire.\n\nThe PMN-150 and PMN-250 are large directional fragmentation mines that scatter fragments in a 60 degree horizontal arc. The PMN-150 produces approximately 1,500 fragments that have an effective range of 150 meters. The PMN-250 is a larger mine which produces 2,100 fragments that have an effective range of 250 meters. The mines have a number of electronic fuzes available including three microwave fuzes, an acoustic fuze and a seismic sensor. The mines can be remotely triggered or deactivated.\n\nThe \"Anti-Transport Mine\" is a large circular directional fragmentation mine that uses an internal fragmentation matrix and five Misznay-Schardin plates. The fragmentation matrix produces a large number of small fragments, and the Misznay Schardin plates produce large fragments that can penetrate armoured vehicles.\n\nThe mine appears to be based on the PMN-250 mine, and the mine is likely to have an effective range of 250 meters.\n\nThe 4AHM-100 uses four 30 kilogram mines with a single central sensor. The mines are triggered simultaneously when the sensor detects a target inside the effective footprint of the mines. The mine is currently at the prototype stage.\n\nThe AHM-200 weighs 35 kilograms and contains 12 kilograms of TNT. The mine's warhead has two sections, a large rectangular warhead with a pre-notched fragmentation liner that produces 1,960 fragments, and a secondary warhead with five Misznay Schardin plates that produce large self-forging fragments. The fragments scatter in an arc of 20 degrees to an effective range of 200 meters, and will penetrate 10 millimeters of armour at 100 meters.\nThe AHM-200-1 weighs 90 kilograms. Like the AHM-200 it consists of two sections, a large circular fragmentation warhead with a filling of ball bearings, and a horizontal section with five Misznay Schardin effect plate charges. The two sections are mounted on a sturdy tripod with a sensor mounted above that contains a Doppler radar fuze and an acoustic fuze. The mine has an effective range of about 100 meters.\n\nThe AHM-200-2 weighs 90 kilograms, and is similar to the AHM-200-1, except that it uses a rectangular fragmentation warhead that produces 1,960 fragments.\n\n", "id": "7710012", "categories": [], "title": "Bulgarian anti-helicopter mines"}

His father, Jan Mol, co-founded a software company in 1966 called Volmac; the company itself turned out to be a huge success and Jan Mol sold it in 1992 to CAP Gemini.\n\nAfter obtaining a MSc degree in Computer Science from Leiden University, Michiel himself went into the software business. In 1993 he set up \"Lost Boys\" with several of his friends, developing software for the CD-ROM market. With the rapid growth of the internet, the company then started making internet software as well as moving into game development. Mol had his first venture into Formula One in 1999, when he and his company sponsored driver Jos Verstappen. Lost Boys then merged with Swedish company \"IconMedialab\".\n\nMol remained on the board and kept the \"Lost Boys Games\" division, before establishing a new company called \"Media Republic\", aiming to use new technology to market products. \"Lost Boys Games\" was transformed into \"Guerrilla Games\", notable for developing the PlayStation 2 game Killzone, during 2004 and a year later it was sold to the Sony Company.\n\nMol later became a supporter of Christijan Albers, after Verstappen left Formula One, and led a group of investors that put together a deal to buy into Spyker Cars and take over the Midland F1 team. Mol is now a major shareholder in Spyker and in September 2006 was appointed as F1 director of Spyker for a period of four years.\n\nOn 14 August 2007, Michiel Mol left Spyker Cars as CEO amid speculation that it and Spyker F1 would be separated due to financial problems. In October 2007 Spyker F1 was sold to Indian businessman Vijay Mallya and renamed Force India. Mol remains as director and co-owner.\n\nWith the bankruptcy of Force India halfway through 2018 and the takeover of the assets by a consortium led by Lawrence Stroll (father of racing driver Lance Stroll), Mol no longer held any rights in Force India.\n\nMol is a co-founder of Space Expedition Corporation (SXC), which intends to offer suborbital space tourism flights and scientific research missions out of Space Port Curaçao.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710104", "text": "Tambaqui\n\nThe tambaqui (\"Colossoma macropomum\") is a large species of freshwater fish in the family Serrasalmidae. It is native to tropical South America, but kept in aquaculture and introduced elsewhere. It is also known by the names black pacu, black-finned pacu, giant pacu, cachama, gamitana, and sometimes as pacu (a name used for several other related species).\n\nThe tambaqui is currently the only member of \"Colossoma\", but the two \"Piaractus\" species were also included in this genus in the past.\n\nThe tambaqui is native to freshwater habitats in the Amazon and Orinoco basins of tropical South America. In nutrient-rich whitewater rivers such as the Madeira, Juruá, Putumayo (Içá) and Purus it ranges throughout, all the way up to their headwaters. In nutrient-poor blackwater rivers such as the Rio Negro and clearwater rivers such as several rightbank tributaries of the Madeira it generally only occurs in the lower c. and is rare beyond the lowermost c. . It is widely kept in aquaculture outside its native range in South America. Miocene fossils are known from the Magdalena River, but modern occurrence in this river is due to introductions by humans.\n\nThe tambaqui is the heaviest characin in the Americas (the lighter \"Salminus\" can grow longer) and the second heaviest scaled freshwater fish in South America (after the arapaima). It can reach up to in total length and in weight, but a more typical size is . The largest caught by rod-and-reel and recognized by IGFA weighed . After the flood season, around 10% of a tambaqui's weight is the visceral fat reserves and at least another 5% is fat found in the head and muscles.\n\nIt is similar in shape to the piranha and juveniles are sometimes confused with the carnivorous fish; the tambaqui is tall and laterally compressed with large eyes and a slightly arched back. Unlike more predatory species, the teeth of the tambaqui are molar-like, an adaption for crushing plant seeds and nuts. The lower half of its body is typically mainly blackish. The remaining is mainly gray, yellowish or olive, but the exact hue varies considerably and depends in part on habitat with individuals in blackwater being much darker than individuals from whitewater. The pelvic, anal and small pectoral fins are black. The tambaqui resembles the pirapitinga (\"Piaractus brachypomus\"), but the latter species has a more rounded head profile (less elongated and pointed) and a smaller adipose fin that lacks rays, as well as differences in teeth and operculum.\n\nHybrids between the tambaqui and the similar \"Piaractus\" (both species) have been produced in aquaculture, and are occasionally seen in the wild. The hybrid offspring can be difficult to identify by appearance alone.\n\nThis species is mostly solitary, but it migrates in large schools. During the non-breeding season, adults stay in flooded forests of white (várzea), clear and blackwater (igapó) rivers. They stay there for four to seven months during the flood season, but as the water level drops they move into the main river channels or to a lesser extent floodplain lakes. At the start of the next flood season, large schools move into whitewater rivers where they spawn between November and February. The exact spawning location in the whitewater rivers is not entirely certain, but apparently along woody shores or grassy levees. The schools then break up as the adults return to the flooded forest of white, clear and blackwater rivers, and the annual pattern is repeated. Larvae are found in whitewater rivers, including the Amazon River itself. Juveniles stay near macrophytes in floodplains and flooded forests year-round, only switching to the adult migration pattern when reaching sexual maturity. Maturity is reached at a length of about .\n\nThe species regularly reaches an age of 40 years and may reach up to 65.\n\nWhen there is not enough oxygen in the river or lake, tambaqui obtain oxygen from the air. They are able to do this by their physical and inner body parts, such as their gills and swim bladder vascularization.\n\nTambaqui is a fish that lives in freshwater. Juveniles can survive in brackish water when the salinity is gradually raised. Salinity levels above 20 g/L result in death. When juveniles are reared in salinities above 10 g/L, there is a significant detrimental effect on growth, haematological parameters and osmoregulatory.\n\nIn an experiment, tambaqui had the pH of their water changed. No deaths occurred to tambaqui if the pH did not fall to 3.0. The only internal difference that was noted in tambaqui when the pH was being altered was a change in the acid-base of the plasma and red cells.\n\nIn another experiment, tambaquis were exposed to pH drops from 6.0 to 4.0, similar to what they would encounter in their natural habitat. Researchers found that the microbial communities of the tambaqui fish gut were very resilient to the pH drops, which could explain part of the ability of tambaquis to migrate between black and white water streams in the Amazon .\n\nTambaqui consume fruits and seeds, especially from woody angiosperms and herbaceous species. Depending on the quantity and food quality of these foods, it causes the fish to decide on their location of their habitat. In one study during the high-water season, 78—98 percent of the diet consisted of fruits. Another study of the stomach content of 138 specimens during the high-water season found that 44% of the weight was fruits and seeds, 30% was zooplankton and 22% was wild rice. Among 125 specimens during the low-water season, a higher percentage had empty stomachs (14%, about ten times more than in the high-water season) and about 70% of the total stomach content weight was zooplakton. In addition to seeds, fruits, wild rice and zooplakton, smaller levels of insects, snails, shrimps, small fish, filamentous algae and decaying plants are consumed.\n\nThe tambaqui plays an important role in dispersing plant seeds. The fruit seeds that fall in the water are consumed by tambaqui and the seed is dispersed somewhere else; this is similar to what birds do. This consumption includes about 35% of the trees and lianas during flood season and these seeds can grow after the floodwater calms down. Compared to the younger and smaller tambaqui, larger and older tambaqui are able to disperse the seeds in a faster rate. The gut of a well-fed tambaqui can contain more than seeds. In general, more seeds are able to pass undamaged through the pirapitinga (\"Piaractus brachypomus\") than the tambaqui, meaning that the former overall is a more efficient seed disperser.\n\nThe flesh of the tambaqui is popular and fetches top prices in fish markets in its native range. It is marketed fresh and frozen.\n\nWild populations of the tambaqui have declined because of overfishing and many currently caught fish are juveniles. In Manaus alone, the landings fell from c. per year in the 1970s to in 1996. Based on a review by IBAMA, it was the 11th most caught fish by weight in the Brazilian Amazon in 1998 (just ahead of the closely related pirapitinga, \"Piaractus brachypomus\").\n\nThe tambaqui is now widely kept in aquaculture. It can live in oxygen-poor waters and is very resistant to diseases. In Brazil, tambaqui is one of the main fish species that is farmed and therefore important to the country's economy. Studies of farmed tambaqui in Brazil have revealed a genetic diversity similar to that seen among wild populations. In fish farms this species is sometimes hybridized with \"Piaractus\" to produce offspring that accept a wider temperature range (colder water) than pure tambaqui.\n\nIn Thailand, this fish, known locally as \"pla khu dam\" (ปลาคู้ดำ), was introduced from Hong Kong and Singapore as part of fish-farming projects, but has adapted to local conditions and thrives in the wild in some areas. There is also an introduced population in Puerto Rico and singles (likely deliberate releases by aquarists) have been caught in a wide range of U.S. states, but only those in the warmest regions can survive.\n\nJuveniles long, sometimes labelled as \"vegetarian piranha\", are frequently seen in the aquarium trade, but they rapidly grow to a large size and require an enormous tank.\n", "id": "7710104", "categories": ["Freshwater fish of Colombia", "Monotypic fish genera", "Serrasalmidae", "Fauna of the Amazon", "Freshwater fish of South America", "Freshwater fish of Brazil"], "title": "Tambaqui"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710107", "text": "Multiple subpial transection\n\nMultiple subpial transections is a surgical treatment modality for epilepsy used in scenarios wherein epileptogenic brain regions (from where partial seizures originate) cannot be removed safely. The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts (transections) into the brain's cerebral cortex. These cuts are thought to interrupt some fibers that connect neighboring parts of the brain, but they do not appear to cause long-lasting impairment in the critical functions that these areas perform.\n\nMultiple subpial transections can help to reduce or eliminate seizures arising from vital functional areas of the cerebral cortex. This procedure has been successful in an unusual type of epilepsy called Landau-Kleffner syndrome, at least for a limited time.\n\nBleeding at the site of the transection is possible, but the procedure is generally well tolerated. Major complications appear to be rare. Transections in language areas of the brain may mildly impair the language function served by that area.\n\nEpilepsy surgery is reserved for people whose seizures are not well controlled by seizure medicines (this situation is sometimes describes as being medically refractory). In the past, epilepsy patients were referred for surgery only after they had taken medicine after medicine without success, often for 10 years or more. However, now the definition of medically refractory has changed and surgery is being performed as early as 1 to 2 years after the diagnosis of epilepsy is first made.\n\nIn children, the definition of medically refractory is even more individualized to the specific child's situation. Surgery may be considered for some children after only weeks or months of treatment with seizure medicines.\n\nIn general, a person is considered to be a potential candidate for surgery if adequate trials of two first-line seizure medicines (ones that are commonly effective in controlling the type of seizures the person is experiencing) and one two-drug combination all have failed to control the seizures. A trial of a medication is considered adequate when it has been increased gradually to the maximum dosage that does not cause serious side effects and then is given for a long enough period. If the person has frequent seizures, any improvement will be obvious after a short time. However, if the seizures generally occur far apart it may take months to determine whether the time between seizures is increasing.\n\nAt some epilepsy centers, patients are offered additional conventional or experimental medications before surgery is considered. However, research suggests that each time a trial of medication fails to control a person's seizures, it becomes less likely that a different medicine or combination will be successful. Since uncontrolled seizures present serious physical risks and social and psychological consequences, the trend these days is to proceed with surgery much sooner than in the past if it seems appropriate for that person.\n\nSuccess rates for epilepsy surgery are constantly improving, and advances in preoperative assessments are largely responsible. Proper patient selection and a thorough presurgical workup are the cornerstones of surgical success.\n\nIf a review of the person's experiences with seizure medicines shows that adequate tests of at least a few different medications have not succeeded in controlling the seizures, then the person may be referred to a specialist for a preoperative (or presurgical) assessment.\n\nThe preoperative assessment has two general objectives:\n\n\nThe number and type of tests that make up the preoperative assessment will depend on the type of surgery being considered. General objectives of the tests include:\n\n", "id": "7710107", "categories": ["Neurosurgery"], "title": "Multiple subpial transection"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710110", "text": "DeFRaG\n\nDeFRaG (also capitalised as defrag, abbreviated as df, and its name comes from « Défis Fragdome ») is a free software modification for id Software's first-person shooter computer game \"Quake III Arena\" (\"Q3A\"). The mod is dedicated to player movements and trickjumping. It aims at providing a platform for self-training, competition, online tricking, machinima making, and trickjumping. Hence it constitutes an exception among other \"Q3A\" mods.\n\nThe mod includes a variety of features—timers and meters, ghost mode, cheat prevention and learning tools. Specially designed maps are provided that will rely on the player's movement abilities to be completed up to the finish line, while standard \"Q3A\" maps and Capture the Flag (CTF) fast captures are supported as well. Furthermore gamespace physics from both the original \"Q3A\" and the \"Challenge ProMode Arena\" (\"CPMA\") mod are supported.\n\nThe modification was released to the public in ca. September–October 2000. In 2002 \"DeFRaG\" was selected as \"Mod of the Week\" at Planet Quake.\n\n\"DeFRaG\" was initially designed for making possible a new kind of competition based on timed runs. Those competitions called \"\"DeFRaG\" runs\" differ from common speedruns in several ways. Unlike speedruns, \"DeFRaG\" runs are not done in maps from an out-of-the-box original game, but in specially designed and customed \"DeFRaG\" maps, and there are no opponents to be vanquished during the run. Because of their design many of these maps cannot be completed by normal player skills; rather trickjumping skills are indispensable. Furthermore start-, checkpoints-, and stop-triggers are built into the maps. As a proof of the accomplishment the mod automatically records a demo of every map completed successfully. Along with the demo, the precise time in which the map was completed is stored.\n\nThe mod's competitive method is lent to it by an online infrastructure which has triggered the formation of a transnational community. Players download custom-designed maps (more than 6000 \"DeFRaG\" maps are available) and aim to complete the map's objectives in the shortest time possible. The best times can be submitted to online high score tables, which are keeping track of the fastest times for particular maps. These online scoreboards can be global or encompass certain regions only. During the mod's highest popularity, the \"DeFRaG\" development team periodically released new map packs, containing a number of officially sanctioned maps. These are generally the only maps on which times are accepted for the official website high score tables. In consequence the \"DeFraG\" community's individual members engage and specialize in one or more different practices: trickjumping itself, movie making, map making, coding, maintaining websites, portals (for interaction and as archives for maps and movies), and online scoreboards.\n\nThe \"DeFRaG\" modification completely removes violence from the otherwise visceral first-person shooter. The gameplay mode or discipline called \"deathmatch\" came of age with \"Doom\" and was also in \"Q3A\", the latter being dedicated to multiplayer competition. From these games electronic sports, and particularly its professional variant emerged. The same games drove the computer games and violence controversy to unprecedented heights. While the \"Doom\" series was heavily criticized for its gory content, the problem with \"Q3A\" was seen to be its focus on deathmatch, because in this discipline the ultimate objective is to kill (\"frag\"), as many other players as possible. But in \"DeFRaG\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay modes killing opponents has no place whatsoever. \"DeFRaG\" gameplay is all about improving the skills to exploit the peculiarities of the \"Q3A\" physics in order to move faster, to navigate along courses through the map topographies formerly deemed to be impossible, or to perform moves as yet unseen. In consequence, the in-game weapons are no more regarded as instruments of destruction. Rather \"DeFRaG\" players use them as tools for moving around gamespace. This transformation of a first-person shooter into a vehicle for \"virtual gymnastics\" meanwhile has gradually been recognized by mainstream media. It is thrown into the public discourse as a counterweight to the stereotype of computer games fostering violent behaviour. The \"DeFRaG\" mod stars prominently in this.\n\nThe high-skill requirement of the game, along with the fast pace, cause that game movies are often made using content created by playing \"DeFRaG\" game modes. Within the community's tradition, especially the fastest runs, difficult trickjumping techniques are included in sequence. The \"DeFRaG\" demo-playback system includes settings to view the primary player from various angles and perspectives. This is in line with the history of the machinima phenomenon which originates from the speedrun community of \"Quake\", the first game in the series. By following the argumentation of Stanford historian of science and technology Henry Lowood, \"DeFRaG\" can be called an instance of transformative high-performance play.\n\nSome of these movies won gaming industry awards. For instance the freestyle trickjumping movie \"Tricking iT2\" by Jethro Brewin \"jrb\" won five Golden Llamas Awards in 2004. The categories were: Best Picture, Best Audio, Best Tech, Best Editing and Direction, and Best Quake Movie. In the following year the trick-stunt movie \"Reaching Aural Nirvana\" by \"mrks\" won a Golden Llamas Award in the category Best Audio. Also in 2005 the art-house short movie \"defragged\" directed by Margit Nobis, an instance of \"Q3A\" machinima (its name is borrowed from the \"DeFRaG\" mod) was shown at numerous prestigious festivals, including the Vienna Independent Shorts festival.\n\nAll maps share the common objective of finishing in the fastest time possible, but there are variations on how this is achieved. Run mode is a flat-out race which the objective is to finish line. In accuracy mode, map is completed after a certain number of targets have been hit with the railgun (a \"Q3A\" sniper rifle). Level mode is similar to run, but map provide a number of alternative ways of reaching the finish line. In fast caps mode, the time is measured since the flag has been taken. Training mode usually requires the successful usage of a particular technique in order to complete the level. There also \"freestyle\" maps without primary objective, but where the player may practise particular techniques. The type of map can usually be seen in its name, although some do not follow this convention.\n\nThere are two game physics and ruleset modes—Vanilla Quake 3 (VQ3) and Challenge ProMode (CPM). VQ3 is an original \"Q3A\" physics and game ruleset; CPM is an altered game physics delivered from \"Challenge ProMode Arena\" modification. It provides a gamemode which includes physics allowing for better air-control, rebalanced weapons, fast weapon switching and improvements of jumping techniques.\n\nThe completion of a \"DeFRaG\" map requires the use of a variety of trickjumping techniques. Most Training maps involve only one or two methods, but some more complicated Run and Level maps can require any number. Various map sections can require quick timing, combination, and flawless execution of several techniques.\n\nJumping techniques allows a player to move faster, farther and/or jump higher. The most common techniques included in \"Q3A\" and \"DeFRaG\" itself includes bunny hopping, air strafing, strafe-jumping, circle-jumping, ramp-jumping, \"etc.\"\n\nBunny-hopping is the most basic method of fast movement in which player is jumping repeatedly instead of running in order to move faster. Strafe-jumping (SJ) is a technique necessary to complete the majority of \"DeFRaG\" maps, and is considered to be the most fundamental technique in trick jumping. It is only possible because of a specificity of the game's physics unintentionally allowing moving vectors to add up to greater acceleration. Basically, no matter if the player's character is moving on the ground (running) or is airborne (jumping), the game engine always strives to limit its speed. However, already in the original \"Quake\" it was discovered that by non-trivial timed sequences of striking the direction keys (involving moving sideways, \"strafing\" in gamer language) and movements of the mouse, this limitation of speed could be overcome. As the \"Quake\" engines are the basis of many games, the possibility of strafe jumping is existing within other games, too. But \"Q3A\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s trickjumping community developed several distinct sub-techniques including single-beat strafe-jumping, single-beat strafe-jumping with airchange, double-beat strafe-jumping, half-beat strafe-jumping, and inverted strafe-jumping. The \"DeFRaG\" mod includes a helping tool, the Camping Gaz Head-Up Display (CGazHUD), which provides conveniently graphically formatted real-time feedback on acceleration and angles involved.\n\nCircle-jumping (CJ) is based on the same principles as strafe-jumping; circle-jumping more often than not is used as the starting technique for a strafe-jumping run. Another technique involves ramped surfaces and it's called ramp-jumping; jumping on a ramped surface gives a height boost.\nAir strafing can be done when the player is in the air, simply keeping him-/herself aligned at the optimal angle in relation to where the player wants to go, making the player go farther and faster whilst airborne; one of the methods for reaching difficult places.\n\nWeapon-jumping techniques requires the player jumps off the ground and, by using the proper weapon, immediately afterwards fires a bullet (rocket, grenade, plasma or BFG plasma) onto the spot on the floor exactly or very near beneath her/him. The damage of the resulting blast delivers momentum to the player's character and propels her/him higher into the air than possible by regular jumping. The gain in momentum can be used for vertical, horizontal, and diagonal movement. In \"Q3A\" four weapons makes self-splash damage and can be combined with each other—rocket and grenade launcher, BFG10K and plasma gun.\n\nRocket-jumping (RJ) is the only tricking technique using a weapon that can commonly be observed in \"Q3A\" professional deathmatch competition—in spite of the resulting cost in health with self-inflicting splash damage enabled in this game mode. Depending on the size and topography of the map and proper synchronisation, two or larger number of rockets can be timed to impact on the very same spot a fraction of a second or n-th after the player arrives there. Thus the player can capitalize on the added momentum furnished by the detonation of multiple projectiles, accelerate substantially and travel long distances airborne. When playing in \"DeFRaG\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s multiplayer mode, projectiles fired by other players can be used as well.\n\nGrenade-jumping (GJ) is a technique which demands more exacting timing, because the grenade-launcher's projectile ricochets after it is launched, and its detonation is delayed. Combining more than one grenade in order to make GJ is also possible but may require more players due to detonation delay. BFG-jumping is a technique kin to rocket-jumping, and only insofar different as the BFG has a higher rate of fire and makes more splash damage. Plasma-jumping, also called plasma-hopping, is a technique in which plasma gives slight boost to the jump.\n\nTeam tricking weapon-jumpings requires teamwork with minimum one additional player. In \"DeFRaG\" every weapon can be used in this technique; the other player's weapon may deliver additional momentum. Most common team techniques includes gauntlet-, rocket-, grenade- and rail-jumping.\n\nThe plasma gun can be used to climb along walls (a technique called plasma-climbing). The vertical climb is the most basic variant. The successive recoil of the gun's rapid fire then lifts the player up the wall. By various combinations of direction-keys and mouselook horizontal and diagonal paths are possible as well. Expert performers can change the directions of travel en route, climb down and up again, climb along curved walls, and hit high walls from mid-air to plasma-climb in any direction.\n\nTechniques exploiting bugs capitalize on flaws in the game engine which in some maps lend special qualities to certain locations resulting in \"Q3A\" physics anomalies.\n\nIf at particular spots the player falls from a certain height to the ground, they will be catapulted up again, although no jumppad is present (the technique is named overbounce). Overbounces can be combined with weapon techniques. The \"DeFRaG\" mod includes an \"overbounce detector\", a tool that helps the player to identify locations in maps where an overbounce is possible. A variety of overbounce opportunities has been discovered, made into techniques, and have been named accordingly: vertical, horizontal, sticky, diagonal (\"weird\"), zero-ups diagonal, and slippery diagonal overbounce.\n\nAt certain locations when a player steps near a wall and jumps to it she/he will end up \"sticking\" to the wall in mid-air. Now the player can perform a speed-gaining technique like strafe-jumping without her/his character moving from the spot, but \"accelerating\" nevertheless. This is a real anomaly as the player character does not move in gamespace, but the game engine ascribes ever higher speed to it. The player then can \"unstick\" from the wall by firing a splash damage weapon into it, and subsequently will move with the speed gained \"on the spot\". This technique is called \"sticky wall\" or \"rebounce\".\n\n", "id": "7710110", "categories": ["First-person shooters", "Esports games", "Open-source video games", "MacOS games", "Linux games", "Multiplayer online games", "Quake III Arena mods"], "title": "DeFRaG"}

This weakening may be triggered by emotional stress, such as the death of a loved one, a break-up, rejection from a partner or constant anxiety. This leads to one of the common names, broken heart syndrome. Stress cardiomyopathy is now a well-recognized cause of acute heart failure, lethal ventricular arrhythmias, and ventricular rupture.\n\nThe name \"takotsubo syndrome\" comes from the Japanese word \"\" \"octopus trap\", because the left ventricle takes on a shape resembling an octopus trap.\n\nThe typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is chest pain associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes mimicking a myocardial infarction of the anterior wall. During the course of evaluation of the patient, a bulging out of the left ventricular apex with a hypercontractile base of the left ventricle is often noted. It is the hallmark bulging-out of the apex of the heart with preserved function of the base that earned the syndrome its name \"takotsubo\" \"octopus trap\", in Japan, where it was first described.\n\nStress is the main factor in takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with more than 85% of cases set in motion by either a physically or emotionally stressful event that prefaces the start of symptoms. Examples of emotional stressors include grief from the death of a loved one, fear of public speaking, arguing with a spouse, relationship disagreements, betrayal, and financial problems. Acute asthma, surgery, chemotherapy, and stroke are examples of physical stressors. In a few cases, the stress may be a happy event, such as a wedding, winning a jackpot, a sporting triumph, or a birthday.\n\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women. Often there is a history of a recent severe (usually negative, sometimes happy) emotional or physical stress.\n\nThe cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not fully understood, but several mechanisms have been proposed.\n\nIt is likely that there are multiple factors at play that could include some amount of vasospasm and a failure of the microvasculature\nCase series looking at large groups of patients report that some patients develop takotsubo cardiomyopathy after an emotional stress, while others have a preceding clinical stressor (such as an asthma attack or sudden illness). Roughly one-third of patients have no preceding stressful event. A 2009 large case series from Europe found that takotsubo cardiomyopathy was slightly more frequent during the winter season. This may be related to two possible/suspected pathophysiological causes: coronary spasms of microvessels, which are more prevalent in cold weather, and viral infections – such as Parvovirus B19 – which occur more frequently during the winter.\n\nTransient apical ballooning syndrome or takotsubo cardiomyopathy is found in 1.7–2.2% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. While the original case studies reported on individuals in Japan, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been noted more recently in the United States and Western Europe. It is likely that the syndrome previously went undiagnosed before it was described in detail in the Japanese literature. Evaluation of individuals with takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically includes a coronary angiogram to rule out occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, which will not reveal any significant blockages that would cause the left ventricular dysfunction. Provided that the individual survives their initial presentation, the left ventricular function improves within two months.\n\nThe diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be difficult upon presentation. The ECG findings often are confused with those found during an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. It classically mimics ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and is characterised by acute onset of transient ventricular apical wall motion abnormalities (ballooning) accompanied by chest pain, shortness of breath, ST-segment elevation, T-wave inversion or QT-interval prolongation on ECG. Cardiac enzymes are usually negative and are moderate at worst, and cardiac catheterization usually shows absence of significant coronary artery disease.\n\nThe diagnosis is made by the pathognomonic wall motion abnormalities, in which the base of the left ventricle is contracting normally or is hyperkinetic while the remainder of the left ventricle is akinetic or dyskinetic. This is accompanied by the lack of significant coronary artery disease that would explain the wall motion abnormalities. Although apical ballooning has been described classically as the angiographic manifestation of takotsubo, it has been shown that left ventricular dysfunction in this syndrome includes not only the classic apical ballooning, but also different angiographic morphologies such as mid-ventricular ballooning and, rarely, local ballooning of other segments.\n\nThe ballooning patterns were classified by Shimizu et al. as \"takotsubo type\" for apical akinesia and basal hyperkinesia, \"reverse takotsubo\" for basal akinesia and apical hyperkinesia, \"mid-ventricular type\" for mid-ventricular ballooning accompanied by basal and apical hyperkinesia, and \"localised type\" for any other segmental left ventricular ballooning with clinical characteristics of takotsubo-like left ventricular dysfunction.\n\nIn short, the main criteria for the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are: the patient must have experienced a stressor before the symptoms began to arise; the patient’s ECG reading must show abnormalities from a normal heart; the patient must not show signs of coronary blockage or other common causes of heart troubles; the levels of cardiac enzymes in the heart must be elevated or irregular; and the patient must recover complete contraction and be functioning normally in a short amount of time.\n\nThe treatment of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally supportive in nature, for it is considered a transient disorder. Treatment is dependent on whether patients experience heart failure or acute hypotension and shock. In many individuals, left ventricular function normalizes within two months. Aspirin and other heart drugs also appear to help in the treatment of this disease, even in extreme cases. After the patient has been diagnosed, and myocardial infarction (heart attack) ruled out, the aspirin regimen may be discontinued, and treatment becomes that of supporting the patient.\n\nWhile medical treatments are important to address the acute symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, further treatment includes lifestyle changes. It is important that the individual stay physically healthy while learning and maintaining methods to manage stress, and to cope with future difficult situations.\n\nAlthough the symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy usually go away on their own and the condition completely resolves itself within a few weeks, some serious complications can happen that must be treated. These most commonly include congestive heart failure and very low blood pressure, and less commonly include blood clotting in the apex of the left ventricle, irregular heart beat, and tearing of the heart wall.\n\nFor patients in acute heart failure, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers, are considered mainstays of heart failure treatment. But use of beta blockers specifically for takotsubo cardiomyopathy is controversial, because they may confer no benefit.\n\nFor people with cardiogenic shock, medical treatment is based on whether a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is present. Therefore, early echocardiography is necessary to determine proper management. For those with obstructed LVOTs inotropic agents should not be used, but instead should be managed like patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, (e.g. phenylephrine and fluid resuscitation). For cases in which the LVOT is not obstructed, inotropic therapy (e.g. dobutamine and dopamine) may be used, but with the consideration that takotsubo is caused by excess catecholamines.\n\nFurthermore, mechanical support with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is well-established as supportive treatment.\n\nDespite the grave initial presentation in some of the patients, most of the patients survive the initial acute event, with a very low rate of in-hospital mortality or complications. Once a patient has recovered from the acute stage of the syndrome, they can expect a favorable outcome and the long-term prognosis is excellent. Even when ventricular systolic function is heavily compromised at presentation, it typically improves within the first few days and normalises within the first few months. Although infrequent, recurrence of the syndrome has been reported and seems to be associated with the nature of the trigger.\n\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy is rare, affecting between 1.2% and 2.2% of people in Japan and 2% to 3% in Western countries who suffer a myocardial infarction. It also affects far more women than men with 90% of cases being women, most postmenopausal. Scientists believe one reason is that estrogen causes the release of catecholamine and glucocorticoid in response to mental stress. It is not likely for the same recovered patient to experience the syndrome twice, although it has happened in rare cases. The average ages at onset are between 58 and 75 years. Less than 3% of cases occurred in patients under age 50.\n\nRees, et al. wrote in 1967 that the death of a close relative increases the risk of dying within one year by a factor of seven.\n\nEngel wrote about sudden and rapid death during psychological stress in 1971 and itemized 8 causation categories: [1] on the impact of the collapse or death of a close person; [2] during acute grief; [3] on threat of loss of a close person; [4] during mourning or on an anniversary; [5] on loss of status or self-esteem; [6] personal danger or threat of injury; [7] after the danger is over; [8] reunion, triumph, or happy ending. He proposed these events provoke neurovegetative responses, involving both the flight-fight and conservation-withdrawal systems, conducive to lethal cardiac events, particularly in individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease.\n\nAlthough the first scientific description of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was not until the 1990s, Cebelin and Hirsch wrote about human stress cardiomyopathy in 1980. The two looked at homicidal assaults that had happened in Cuyahoga County, Ohio the past 30 years, specifically those with autopsies who had no internal injury, but had died of physical assault. They found that 11 of 15 had myofibrillar degeneration similar to animal stress studies. In the end, they concluded their data supported \"the theory of catecholamine mediation of these myocardial changes in man and of the lethal potential of stress through its effect on the heart\".\n\nThe first studied case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was in Japan in 1991 by Sato et al. More cases of the syndrome appeared in Japan within the next decade, although western medicine had still not acknowledged it. The syndrome finally occurred in 1997 when Pavin et al. wrote about two cases of \"reversible LV dysfunction precipitated by acute emotional stress.\" The western world had not heard of such a thing at the time, as it was incredibly rare and often misdiagnosed. The Japanese at last reported about the syndrome to the west in 2001 under the name \"transient LV apical ballooning\" though at this point the west had already heard of numerous cases. The syndrome reached international audiences through the media in 2005 when the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" wrote about the syndrome.\n\nA case of what is evidently takotsubo syndrome is a central motif of the end of the novel \"Blossoms in Autumn\" (: 1917) by Slovene writer Ivan Tavčar and the film \"Blossoms in Autumn\" (1973) inspired by it. A village girl named Meta suddenly dies after she had been asked by Janez, a lawyer from Ljubljana that she had spent summer with, to marry him. At her funeral, her father states that she was never very healthy, and that she had a heart defect. Her mother states: \"She has died from happiness.\"\n\n", "id": "7710140", "categories": [], "title": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy"}

The airfield is located approximately mi west of Great Dunmow, north of the A120; about northeast of London\n\nOpened in 1943, it was used by both the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces during the war, primarily as a bomber airfield. The airfield was closed in 1948.\n\nToday the airfield is located on private land primarily used for agriculture.\n\nGreat Dunmow was designed as a Class A airfield bomber airfield, built by the US Army 818th Engineer Battalion (Aviation) with specialised work by British contractors.\n\nThe airfield was built on ancient parkland belonging to Easton Lodge and some 10,000 trees were destroyed to enable its construction, including over 200 mature oak trees. It consisted of a set of three converging runways each containing a concrete runway for takeoffs and landings, optimally placed at 60 degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern. The runways were a main runway, aligned 15/33 and two secondary secondary runways, aligned 11/29 and 04/22. An encircling perimeter track was also constructed, containing 50 loop-type hardstands.\n\nGreat Dunmow airfield was opened on 1 July 1943 and was used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth and Ninth Air Forces. It was known as USAAF Station AAF-164 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and by which it was referred to instead of location. It's USAAF Station Code was \"GD\".\n\nUSAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Great Dunmow were: \nRegular Army Station Units included:\n\nThe first unit to use Great Dunmow was the American 386th Bombardment Group (Medium) which arrived from RAF Boxted on 24 September 1943.

On the continent, the 386th BG used the following Advanced Landing Grounds:\n\nAfter V-E Day the group returned to the United States, inactivating at Seymour Johnson AFB North Carolina on 7 August 1945.\n\nThe airfield was abandoned in 1948.\n\nWith the end of military control in 1950 the grassed areas were cut for a grass meal company through the 1950s which supplied it to various farms in the region. Starting in 1960, farming operations commenced and the concrete areas were removed for aggregate in 1965/66 for use as part of the new A12 road.\n\nToday, there is very little left except some single track agricultural roads remaining from the perimeter track and a blister hangar with a few nissen huts near Easton Lodge. The runway layout and the airfield perimeter track are easily identified in aerial photography, but no substantial amount of concrete remains. The 22 end of the secondary northeast runway does however, have a short full width of runway intact, being used for manure storage. The current owners, Land Securities hope to redevelop the site and surrounding area, including the construction of around 9,000 homes.\n\nThere is a small museum in Great Dunmow which holds some exhibits of the airfield and the 386th Bomb Group, along with a stained glass window memorial in Little Easton church.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7710154", "categories": ["Airfields of the VIII Bomber Command in the United Kingdom", "Airfields of the 9th Bombardment Division in the United Kingdom", "1943 establishments in England", "Royal Air Force stations of World War II in the United Kingdom", "Royal Air Force stations in Essex"], "title": "RAF Great Dunmow"}

The game was invented by Allan Goff of Novatia Labs, who describes it as \"a way of introducing quantum physics without mathematics\", and offering \"a conceptual foundation for understanding the meaning of quantum mechanics\".\n\nThe motivation to invent quantum tic-tac-toe was to explore what it means to be in two places at once. In classical physics, a single object cannot be in two places at once. In quantum physics, however, the mathematics used to describe quantum systems seems to imply that before being subjected to quantum measurement (or \"observed\") certain quantum particles can be in multiple places at once. (The textbook example of this is the double-slit experiment.) How the universe can be like this is rather counterintuitive. There is a disconnect between the mathematics and our mental images of reality, a disconnect that is absent in classical physics. This is why quantum mechanics supports multiple \"interpretations\".\n\nThe researchers who invented quantum tic-tac-toe were studying abstract quantum systems, formal systems whose axiomatic foundation included only a few of the axioms of quantum mechanics. Quantum tic-tac-toe became the most thoroughly studied abstract quantum system and offered insights that spawned new research. It also turned out to be a fun and engaging game, a game which also provides good pedagogy in the classroom.\n\nThe rules of quantum tic-tac-toe attempt to capture three phenomena of quantum systems:\n\nQuantum tic-tac-toe captures the three quantum phenomena discussed above by modifying one basic rule of classical tic-tac-toe: the number of marks allowed in each square. Additional rules specify when and how a set of marks \"collapses\" into classical moves.\n\nOn each move, the current player marks two squares with their letter (X or O), instead of one, and each letter (X or O) is subscripted with the number of the move (beginning counting with 1). The pair of marks are called \"spooky marks\". (Because X always moves first, the subscripts on X are always odd and the subscripts on O are always even.)\n\nFor example, player 1's first move might be to place \"X\" in both the upper left and lower right squares. The two squares thus marked are called \"entangled\". During the game, there may be as many as eight spooky marks in a single square (if the square is entangled with all eight other squares).\n\nThe phenomenon of collapse is captured by specifying that a \"cyclic entanglement\" causes a \"measurement\". A \"cyclic entanglement\" is a cycle in the entanglement graph; for example, if\nthen these three squares form a cyclic entanglement. At the end of the turn on which the cyclic entanglement was created, the player whose turn it is \"not\" — that is, the player who did not create the cycle — chooses one of two ways to \"measure\" the cycle and thus cause all the entangled squares to \"collapse\" into classical tic-tac-toe moves. In the preceding example, since player 2 created the cycle, player 1 decides how to \"measure\" it. Player 1's two options are:\n\n\nAny other chains of entanglements hanging off the cycle would also collapse at this time; for example, if square 1 were also entangled via O with square 5, then either measurement above would force O to collapse into square 5. (Note that it is impossible for two or more cyclic entanglements to be created in a single turn.)\n\nWhen a move collapses into a single square, that square is permanently marked (in larger print) with the letter and subscript of the collapsed move — a \"classical mark\". A square containing a classical mark is fixed for the rest of the game; no more spooky marks may be placed in it.\n\nThe first player to achieve a tic-tac-toe (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) consisting entirely of \"classical marks\" is declared the winner. Since it is possible for a single measurement to collapse the entire board and give classical tic-tac-toes to both players simultaneously, the rules declare that the player whose tic-tac-toe has the \"lower maximum subscript\" earns one point, and the player whose tic-tac-toe has the \"higher maximum subscript\" earns only one-half point.\n\n\n", "id": "7710180", "categories": ["Thought experiments in quantum mechanics", "Tic-tac-toe", "Quantum mechanics"], "title": "Quantum tic-tac-toe"}

The first game was played at Lydney on 22 November 1888 against Coleford who won by 3 tries and 1 conversion to nil. The club was originally nicknamed \"the Tinplaters\", but later were more widely known as the Severnsiders.\n\nThe club enjoyed several successful runs in the John Player Cup during the 1980s, including a match against Sale, then the top club side in England, on 23 January 1983. The match was televised on the BBC's Rugby Special, with Lydney narrowly losing 9 – 16.\n\n\nUpon its founding, Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe, later Governor-General of New Zealand, was invited to become President of the club. He held this position for 70 years until his death in 1958.\n\nFrom the early days Lydney had produced a steady stream of players who achieved County honours.

Launched in 1794, the ship saw service in the Atlantic against the British Royal Navy.\n\nShe was part of the fleet that sailed in December 1796 on the disastrous Expédition d'Irlande. After unsuccessful attempts to land troops on Ireland, the \"Droits de l'Homme\" headed back to her home port of Brest with the soldiers still on board. Two British frigates were waiting to intercept stragglers from the fleet, and engaged \"Droits de l'Homme\" in the Action of 13 January 1797. Heavily damaged by the British ships and unable to manoeuvre in rough seas, the ship struck a sandbar and was wrecked. Hundreds of lives were lost in the disaster.\n\nThe ship was built at Port-Liberté (now Lorient) and launched on \"10 Prairial de l'An II\" (29 May 1794). Her name refers to the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, one of the founding documents of the French Revolution.\n\n\"Droits de l'Homme\", was involved in the Action of 6 November 1794, chasing the British 74s and . \"Droits de l'Homme\" caught up with \"Alexander\" first, but was forced out of action with damage to her rigging, but \"Alexander\" was soon caught by and and captured.\n\n\"Droits de l'Homme\" was lightly involved in Battle of Groix, on 22 June 1795, firing few if any shots during the battle.\n\nIn December 1796 \"Droits de l'Homme\", under \"capitaine de vaisseau\" Raymond de Lacrosse, took part in the invasion attempt against Ireland, carrying 549 soldiers. On their way, the fleet was dispersed by tempests. The \"Droits de l'Homme\" arrived at Bantry Bay and cruised off the coast, capturing the brigs \"Cumberland\" and \"Calypso\". She stayed there for eight days to ascertain that no French ship was in distress on the coast, and departed for Brittany.\nOn \"25 Nivôse An V\" in the Action of 13 January 1797, off Penmarch, \"Droits de l'Homme\" met the British frigates (44), under Sir Edward Pellew, and (36), commanded by Robert C. Reynolds. The sea was rough, preventing \"Droits de l'Homme\" from using her lower deck batteries and from boarding the British. Lacrosse was wounded; he gave command of the ship to his second officer, Prévost de Lacroix, and had his crew swear not to strike their colours.\n\nAfter 13 hours of combat, running out of ammunition, the British broke contact when \"Indefatigable\" sighted land ahead. \"Indefatigable\", despite having damage to her masts and rigging, managed to beat off the lee shore and escape Penmarch reefs; \"Amazon\" ran aground and was destroyed near Plozévet, and her crew captured. \"Droits de l'Homme\", having lost her rudder, masts and anchors, ran aground off Plozévet.\n\nSome of the crew were rescued by the ship's boats and fishing boats from nearby villages, but the rescue was interrupted for five days by the storm; 60 men died for lack of food and water. General Jean-Amable Humbert, who was commanding the soldiers aboard, narrowly escaped drowning, and between 250 and 390 men died in the wreck. Captain Lacrosse was last to leave the ship.\n\nIn 1840, Major Pipon, an English officer who had been a prisoner aboard, erected an inscribed menhir on the coast in remembrance of the tragedy. In 1876 it was broken into several pieces by the weather, but restored in 1882.\n", "id": "7710191", "categories": ["1794 ships", "Ships of the line of the French Navy", "Maritime incidents in 1797", "Shipwrecks of the Biscay coast", "Téméraire-class ships of the line"], "title": "French ship Droits de l'Homme (1794)"}

The house, at 318 High Street, faces west from the east side of High Street north of the corner at High and Court Streets. A large wooded lawn extends to the Honors College (Russell House 1828) property to the north. High Street between Church and Washington Streets was the most prestigious residential area in Middletown during the 19th century. It was later home to the KNK Fraternity of Wesleyan University. The structural system consists of load-bearing masonry with a flat roof, and materials include brick and flushboarding walls and a brownstone foundation.\n\nThis house was built in 1841-1842 for Edward A. Russell (1797–1874) on a portion of the Russell family estate. Edward Russell worked in the foreign mercantile trade until he returned to Middletown in 1838. He later served as mayor, state representative and national convention delegate.\n\nEdward A. Russell had personal contact with the firm of Town and Davis while supervising the building of the well-known Greek Revival Russell House (1828) for his younger brother, Samuel W. Russell. Thus it is possible that Edward retained the services of this firm when his house was built. Such a possibility is reinforced by early photographs showing the original proportions and decoration. These indicate that the house was a sophisticated and high style example of Greek Revival, and stylistically close to the DeRham Brevoort House (attributed to Davis) in New York City and \"Highwood\", Henry Whitney's estate in New Haven (1835–1836) by Town and Davis.\n\nEdward Russell's grand-nephew, Richard L. deZeng (1847–1932), occupied the house until his death in 1932. Wesleyan purchased the property from the administrators of the estate of E.A. Russell and then sold it to Alpha Sigma Delta Alumni Association, Inc. in 1934. At this time the structure was altered for use as a fraternity house.\n\nThe heavy cornice at the top of the building was lowered to the second floor and windows were placed above the cornice to form a full third floor. Window cornices were removed and new window openings cut in the south facade. The second and third floors were divided into three room suites; however, the first floor remains largely unaltered.\n\nThis house was the last example of Greek Revival architecture to be built in the prestigious area of High Street.\n\nThe house is currently used for lectures, concerts, and other special events, and is preserved in good condition.

FCG is an open instrument that can be used by construction grammarians who want to formulate their intuitions and data in a precise way and who want to test the implications of their grammar designs for language parsing, production and learning. The formalism can be tested through an interactive web interface at the FCG website.\n\nFCG integrates many notions from contemporary computational linguistics such as feature structure and unification-based language processing, but uses them in a novel way to operationalize insights from construction grammar theory. Constructions are considered bi-directional and hence usable both for parsing and production. Processing is flexible in the sense that FCG provides meta-layer processing for coping with novelty, partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences. FCG is called 'fluid' because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars. The research on FCG is primarily carried out by Luc Steels and his teams at the VUB AI Lab in Brussels and the Language Evolution Lab in Barcelona, and the Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Paris. Besides Steels, current and former contributors to the FCG formalism include Katrien Beuls, Paul Van Eecke, Remi van Trijp, Joris Bleys, Joachim De Beule, Martin Loetzsch, Nicolas Neubauer, Michael Spranger, Wouter Van den Broeck, Pieter Wellens, and others.\n\nFCG treats parsing and production as a search problem, in which the FCG engine searches for the best utterance to verbalize a meaning (language production) or the best semantic network (or meaning representation) to analyze an utterance (parsing). Each state representation in the search process is called a Transient Structure. A Transient Structure can be considered as an extended feature structure, as it consists of a (flat) list of \"units\" that consist of a unit-name (a unique constant symbol) and a unit-body (a set of feature-value pairs). Older versions of FCG (before 2011) used to split the transient structure into two separate poles for semantics and syntax, but the current version implements a single representation for all linguistic information.\n\nFCG constructions (or technically speaking: construction schemas) are treated as the operators of the search process. That is, by applying a construction to a transient structure, a new transient structure (or state representation) in the search space may be created. Just like transient structures, constructions mostly consists of units of feature-value pairs. Constructions are however more structured because they contain two distinct parts:\n\nTo decide whether a construction can apply, the conditional part is \"matched\" against the current transient structure using a unification-based algorithm. In production, only features that are part of the formulation locks of the construction must be matched against the transient structure; whereas in parsing, only features that are part of the comprehension locks will be considered. If a match is successful, the FCG engine will \"merge\" all of the units of feature-value pairs with the transient structure in a similar unification-based process.\n\nFCG features a meta-layers of diagnostics, repairs and consolidation strategies that allow the grammar designer to implement ways to handle novelty, errors and unexpected input during processing. These diagnostics and repairs can also be used for exploring the (automated) acquisition of new constructions.\n\n\n", "id": "7710218", "categories": ["Grammar frameworks"], "title": "Fluid construction grammar"}

Satya means “truth” and narayana means, “The highest being” so Satyanarayan means “The highest being who is an embodiment of Truth”. Vrat or Puja means a religious vow, religious observance, or obligation.\nHindus throughout perform Sri Satyanarayan Vrat for the divine blessings of health, wealth, prosperity, opulence, education; relief from troubles and sickness. It can also be performed because of success in business or career growth; during social functions like marriages, house-warming ceremonies, naming of the children and so on.\n\nThis puja is first mentioned in Skanda Purana, Reva Kanda by Suta Puranik to the rishis in Naimisharanya. The details are part of the Katha (Story) that is usually read during the ritual\nSri Satya Narayana puja is a very popular ritual in most parts of India including Assam, Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Manipur..\n\nThe ritual is usually performed on the Full moon day of every month, Ekadashi (11th day after full moon or new moon), Kārtika Pūrṇimā, Vaiśākhā Pūrṇimā, solar eclipse day or on Saṅkrānti except during Āṣāḍha Candra Masa. It is also performed on special occasions and during times of achievements, as an offering of gratitude to the Lord. These occasions could include marriage, graduation, start of a new job, purchase of a new home, to name a few. In addition, the performance of this most auspicious puja generally confers a child to couples trying to start a family.\n\nThe Satyanarayan puja can be performed on any day for any reason. It is not a puja confined to any festivities, but Purnima (full moon day) is considered specifically auspicious for this puja. Performing this puja in the evening is considered more appropriate. However, one can perform this puja in the morning as well.\n\nThis puja is very simple, can be performed by anyone, and it does not require a priest to perform it.\nThe original concept was instructions given by rishi Narada Muni while on tour of earth he noticed tremendous amounts of sufferings all around due to malnutrition. He went to lord Vishnu and described the situation and was told with instructions to perform Pooja and the other stories to be narrated. One of the key instruction was to invite as many friends, relatives and neighbors to attend the ceremony and to feed them and to offer as many types of fruits as possible and the sufferings will be eliminated, and this was due to being well fed and consumption of fruits.\n\nThe previous night, think of Lord Sri Satyanarayana and mentally decide to perform puja the next day. Invite your relatives and friends. Tradition mandates to abstain from worldly pleasures.\n\nOn the puja day, early in the morning keeping the same thoughts of worshiping the Lord, take a head bath. If performing the evening, again take a head-bath. This should be done by both husband and wife. Wear a clean dress.\n\nObserve Fast (if possible).\n\nKeep all the things for puja ready, near the altar. The total duration of the puja - start to finish – will be around 3 hours.\n\nDecorate the front door with mango leaves. The place near the altar is cleaned (with cow dung, where possible).\n\nThe Altar is placed in an East-West direction such that the devotees performing the puja will be seated facing east. It is decorated with floral designs, usually using rice flour and other coloured powders. A new white cloth is spread on the Altar and layered with raw rice. \nA Kalash (small pot made of Silver, Copper, Brass, or even earthen) is placed in the middle of Altar. That small pot should add one betel nut, one rupee coin ,some jwar or wheat and then filled it with holy water like gangajal ,if not available you can use clean water .A coconut is placed on top and wrapped with a cloth.5 Mango or ashok leaves are placed between the coconut and the pot. After this a red thread (kalava or moli) is tied 3 round in neck of pot . Make a symbol of swastik in pot ,it is a good and positive symbol .This too is decorated with Chandan (Sandal paste) and kumkum.This process is called kalash sthapna .\n\nA framed picture of Lord Satyanarayana is placed on the far side of the Altar. Flowers and garlands can be placed on this frame.\n\nPlace all the puja items near the Altar.\n\nThe devotees performing the puja will be seated facing the Altar.\n\nThe food is cooked as normal, usually rice, dal and vegetables; avoiding any non-vegetarian (egg, meat, and fish dishes)and also avoid onion and garlic.\n\nMake sure the kitchen is kept clean and devoid of impurities.\n\nThe main Prasad [offering] (is also called as Sapatha, Sheera or Sapaada Bhakshya[ಸಪಾದ ಭಕ್ಷ್ಯ]) is prepared with equal parts (usually one and one-forth parts) of sugar, Semolina, and Ghee. Popularly, it is cooked to blanch. Cardamoms, cashews, raisins, and/or bananas may be added while cooking or as garnishing. Some people avoid cooking and merely mix the ingredients together.\n\nVarious regional variations exist in the way it is cooked. It also has various names - Telugu Prasadam, Marathi Sheera, Gujarati Sheera, Bengali Sinni, Punjabi Panjiri, etc.\n\nThe main Prasad is offered together with daily food, various fruits, and Panchamrutam (uncooked mixture of Milk, Yogurt, Ghee, Honey, and Sugar).\n\nThe following is a list of items needed for the puja.\n\n\nGood to have\n\nThe following procedure is as prescribed by and performed in Andhra Pradesh. Several regional and traditional variations occur as mentioned in the following section.\nThe devotee begins by purifying oneself (achamniyam) and sankalpam (a vow that the named devotee is performing the puja on such time and era, to attain such cause).\n\nThe puja starts with a prayer to Gaṇesha, to remove all obstacles that may occur as a result of incorrectly performing the puja. This is done by the sixteen upacharas, chanting the names of Lord Gaṇesha and offering prasada (offering usually consisting of banana, coconut, modak, a sugar and coconut mixture, or laddu) and the showering of flowers. Subsequently Varuna puja (kalash puja) is performed.\n\nA uniqueness of this puja is the invoking of pancha lokapalaka, navagrahas along with their companion and co-companions, and the eight dikpalakas. This totals to 40 (5+9+(9*2)+8). Each God has a vedic symbol of a unique metal. Since these are difficult to obtain by the common means, and since the modern currency coins by minted with multiple metals, each Guest God is represented by a coin. They are placed on a betel leaf. The betel nut, akshit and dry dates are the offerings. Thus, the requirement of 40 coins, betel leaves and dry dates.\n\nThe main puja commences with the worship to Lord Satyanarayana. The idol (or coin) of Lord Satyanarayana is bathed and cleaned with panchamritam. After placing the deity in the correct position, 1008 names of Sri Satyanarayana are chanted.\n\nThis is followed by offering of Prasada and flowers (Mantra Pushpam).\n\nAnother requirement of the puja is that the story be heard among all those observing and partaking in the puja.\n\nThe five-part story involves the origin of the puja, benefits of the puja, the potential mishaps that may occur with the forgetting performance of the puja, the magnitude of the Lord’s benevolence and the importance of the Prasad, and consequences of snubbing the ritual.\n\nThe puja concludes with an Aarti , which consists of lighting camphor in the vicinity of an image of the Lord.\n\nAfter the puja is over, participants and observers of the puja are required to partake the prasad that was offered and blessed by the Lord.\n\n\nAn essential part of this puja is listening to the Sri Satyanarayana Swami Katha (narrative).\n\nThe five-part story involves the origin of the puja, benefits of the puja, the potential mishaps that may occur with the forgetting performance of the puja, the magnitude of the Lord’s benevolence and the importance of the Prasad, and consequences of snubbing the ritual.\n\nChapter 1 narrates the origins of the puja. Sri Satyanarayana Katha comes from the Skanda Puraṇa, Reva khaṇḍa. Suta Maharṣhi is the one narrating this account to Saunaka Muni, in Naimiṣaraṇya to the ṛiṣhis who were performing a thousand year yajna for the benefit of humanity. The procedure itself was narrated my Sriman Narayana to Narada. \nChapter 2 narrates the benefits of the puja. A poor Brahmin was approached by Lord Himself in disguise and He advised him of the puja. Upon successful completion of the puja, the Brahmin could overcome his difficulties and enjoy eternal bliss. It also narrates about the good fortune of a woodcutter who witnesses the Brahmin performing the puja and continues to gain prosperity after performing the puja.\n\nChapter 3 narrates the mishaps that may occur for dishonoring the vow to perform the puja. A merchant, with an intention to establish family, vows to perform the puja upon having a child. He adjourns the vow to complete it during the child’s marriage. Upon forgetting the vow, the Lord puts the merchant in hardship. The merchant is falsely accused and imprisoned. His entire business is confiscated by the king. His household goes bankrupt. He is freed when his wife recollects the promise and performs the puja.\n\nChapter 4 narrates about the Lord’s benevolence and the importance of the Prasad. This is a continuation of the previous chapter. During an incident, the merchant puts off the Lord about his merchandise, thereby losing all its value. Realizing his folly, the merchant regrets his intemperance and seeks forgiveness. On hearing that the merchant reached the dockyard, his wife and daughter, who were performing the puja at that time, forget to take the Prasad. Angered with the disrespect, He makes the boats sink into the sea, only to be restored when they have the Prasad.\n\nChapter 5 narrates about the importance of the puja and not that of the devotees. A group of backwoodsmen was performing the puja. King discards and disregards the offerings, thereby invoking the wrath of Sri Satyanarayana. The king loses his kingdom, wealth, and family, only to be restored upon realizing his recklessness and seeking forgiveness to Sri Satyanarayana and accepting the offerings.\nThe rituals concludes with the Puja participants including the story audience singing Invocation prayers (Aarti) to Satya Nārāyaṇa.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7710231", "categories": ["Puja types in Hinduism", "Vaishnavism"], "title": "Satyanarayan Puja"}

His father worked full-time for the United States Post Office Department starting at 4 a.m., then taught or played golf until dark, weather permitting. In order to be around his father, Bob learned to play golf when he was six, but the game was also a fit with his competitive nature. He attended Florida State University on a golf scholarship, but Hubert Green was the star of the college team.\n\nDuval did not consider playing on the pro tour; he married his first wife, Diane Poole, and was hired at Timuquana Country Club in Jacksonville, Florida as an assistant pro in 1968. The following year, he switched to the municipal course in Fernandina Beach for four years. His son Brent was born in 1969, followed by David in 1971 and Deirdre in 1976. Duval returned to Timuquana as head pro in 1973, and stayed there for 13 years while raising his children.\n\nDuval's oldest son, Brent, developed aplastic anemia. The family sought treatment at Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, where younger brother David, who was 9, underwent surgery to donate bone marrow. Unfortunately, the transplant was not successful, and Brent died as a result of sepsis on May 17, 1981 at age 12. Both Bob and Diane used alcohol to numb the emotional pain and their relationship deteriorated. Duval was unable to cope, and moved out of the family home for a year. Counseling enabled him to reunite with his wife and children, and in 1987, he accepted an offer to be golf pro at the \"Plantation\", a new gated, golf community in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Duval's father, \"Hap\" died in 1991, and Bob was unhappy in his marriage, so in 1993, he left his family permanently and the divorce was final in 1996. When Duval began seeing Sharon Blum, David stood by his mother, who was deeply depressed. He blamed his father and their relationship diminished. After some time had passed, they began talking again, and David realized that his father was happy.\n\nAs his 50th birthday approached, David encouraged him to join the Senior PGA Tour (now known as the Champions Tour). Bob stated, \"When he told me that he believed in my game, especially after what we had been through, it did a lot for my confidence.\" \nDuval played in some \"club pro\" tournaments to sharpen his game. He and Shari were together constantly, and got married in 1996. Jack Nicklaus put together a series of 14 south Florida tournaments called the \"Golden Bear Tour\". The entry fee was $15,000 plus living expenses, and Duval didn't have the money. Shari created a business proposal for individuals to sponsor Bob Duval's tour career. Six friends invested $5,000 each, which would be reimbursed from winnings. Duval won one of the tournaments and was certain he could make it on the tour. His total winnings were $29,000, allowing him to repay the sponsors.\n\nHe has about two dozen top-10 finishes including a wire-to-wire win at the 1999 Emerald Coast Classic which he shared with his new wife, Shari. His win came on the same day that his son David won The Players Championship on the PGA Tour and ascended to the #1 ranking in the world.\n\nIn June 2001, Duval began working with Massachusetts-based author Carl Vigeland on a book that became part of a Basic Books series, the Art of Mentoring. Told in the form of letters to members of Duval's family and his many friends, the book focuses on the connections between a person's life and his or her golf game. The letters also trace his life and career, with the final, moving letter addressed to the ghost of his father, Hap, also a golf professional. An Afterword follows under David Duval's byline. \"Letters to a Young Golfer,\" published to critical acclaim in 2002, is still in print. \n\nChampions Tour playoff record (0–1)\n", "id": "7710293", "categories": ["Golfers from New York (state)", "Golfers from Florida", "People from Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida", "1946 births", "Sportspeople from Schenectady, New York", "Florida State Seminoles men's golfers", "PGA Tour Champions golfers", "American male golfers"], "title": "Bob Duval"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710308", "text": "Bulgarian nouns\n\nBulgarian nouns have the categories grammatical gender, number, case (only vocative) and definiteness. A noun has one of three specific grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) and two numbers (singular and plural), With cardinal numbers and some adverbs, masculine nouns use a separate count form. Definiteness is expressed by a definite article which is postfixed to the noun.\n\nNouns can be formed from other words by means of suffixes. Some important suffixes that are used to form nouns are:\n\nIn Bulgarian nouns have three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. The gender is an inherent characteristic of every noun. This means that each noun is masculine, feminine or neuter. Only nouns referring to people or animals can change their gender. In most cases the gender of the noun can be determined according to its ending, but there aren't any strict rules. Masculines are all the nouns which refer to male people or animals, and many more.\nNouns referring to people or animals can change their gender (from masculine to feminine) by\nadding the suffixes: -ка, -ица, -а, -иня:\nThe gender of nouns that have no singular form can't be determined: \"финанси, очила, обуща\".\n\nSome nouns have changed gender with time, for example the feminine \"vecher\" (evening — it retains its masculine character in the phrase \"dobur vecher\" - good evening), or \"var\" (lime). Some words, in spoken Bulgarian at least, can take either gender, e.g. \"domat/domata\" (tomato — masc/fem) or \"sandal/sandala\" (sandal); some can take either gender with slight variations in meaning, e.g. \"gaz\" (gas) or \"prah\" (dust); while others, usually for etymological reasons, can have completely different meanings – e.g. \"med\" means \"honey\" in the masculine, and \"copper\" in the feminine, or \"prust\", meaning finger (masc), or soil (fem).\n\nA noun has singular (единствено) and plural (множествено) number (число). Unlike in English, where almost all nouns add -s in the plural, in Bulgarian there are many endings and despite of the rules listed below one cannot be absolutely sure which ending to use with which noun. Besides, when forming the plural some nouns alter additionally. That is why a noun should always be learnt together with its plural form. Generally if the noun ends in a vowel, it is removed before adding the plural suffix. Sometimes the stress changes position.\n\nMasculine nouns which end in a consonant have another plural form, besides their usual one. This form is called count form or numerical form (бройна форма — broyna forma), and is used only after cardinal numbers and the adverbs \"колко\" (how many), \"толкова\" (this/that/so many), \"няколко\" (several/a few/some): \"пет / колко / толкова / няколко молива versus \"тези моливи. An exception to this occurs in some \"exclamations\" following \"колко\", when the ordinary plural is used and the inferred meaning is \"what a large amount of!\": e.g. \"колко коня?\" (\"kolko konya?\" \"how many horses?\" - numeric plural), but \"колко коне!\" (\"kolko kone!\" – ordinary plural, implying \"look at all those horses!\").\n\nThe count form is formed with the endings -а and -я, and unlike the usual plural form without any additional changes (no losing of the sounds -ъ and -е, no change of consonants, etc.), except for stress moving (it never falls on the last syllable so if it is on the last syllable in the singular, it will move on the penultimate in the count form), and metathesis of ъ in the letter group ръ.\n\nThere are also a handful of neuter nouns for parts of the body which also take a count form – \"ramo (shoulder) → ramene / 2 ramena\"; \"kolyano (knee) → kolene / 2 kolena\".\n\n\n\nThe count form is avoided with nouns denoting persons and in such cases the usual plural form is much more preferred (\"колко ученици\" - how many students, \"осем ученици — eight students).\n\nThe usual form is also used after masculine numbers (in Bulgarian some cardinal numbers have gender), ending in -ма (these forms of the numbers are used only with male persons, not with other masculine nouns denoting inanimate objects) - \"двама ученици\" (two students), \"петима ученици\" (five students).\n\nSome nouns have irregular plural forms:\n\nSome neuter nouns have two or more plural forms (most of them with no difference in meaning). For example: \"кълбо — кълба and кълбета, крило — крила and криле, рамо — рамена and рамене, коляно — колена and колене, море — морета and моря, дърво — дървета, дърва and дървеса, четене — четения and четенета\". Some plural forms refer to different meanings: \"дърва\" - fuel wood, \"дървета\" - trees, some are used in specific contexts: the variants \"моря\" (from \"море\"), \"поля\" (from \"поле\") are found only in the poetry.\n\nIn Bulgarian there are some nouns that are only in the singular, they are uncountable. Such nouns are some abstract words (\"материализъм\" - materialism, \"сигурност\" - security, любов — love), some collective words (\"студентство\" - students), chemical elements and some other substances (\"водород\" - hydrogen, \"въглерод\" - carbon, \"грис\" - semolina, \"ориз\" - rice, etc.). There are also words which have only plural forms. These are nouns referring to objects, composed of two identical parts (\"очила\" - glasses, \"ножици\" - scissors), and some concepts and objects, consisting of many elements (\"въглища\" - coal, \"финанси\" - finances, \"пари\" - money).\n\nIn Bulgarian nouns have the grammatical category definiteness (определеност). The morphological indicator of definiteness is the presence of a special morpheme, called definite article (определителен член). The definite article is placed after the noun and is written together with it. The using of the definite article in Bulgarian is called членуване.\n\n\nThere is an additional discrepancy between pronunciation and spelling when the stress of some monosyllabic masculine nouns falls on the definite articles -а or -ят/я.\n\nIn Bulgarian masculine and feminine nouns have two cases (падежи) Nominative (Именителен падеж) and Vocative (Звателен падеж). The vocative is used when addressing a person or a thing, in all other cases the nominative is used. Theoretically, all masculine and feminine nouns can be declined in the vocative but vocative forms are used mainly with personal names and with nouns denoting people.\n\nFeminine nouns which end in a consonant do not have vocative forms.\n\nThere is a difference in usage between vocative forms of common nouns and proper nouns. The former are used always, when addressing someone, and the use of nominative forms instead is immediately perceived as a gross error:\n\nThe latter, however, are considered informal, and are used less frequently, especially the\nvocative forms of female personal names ending in -о, which are even considered by some to be rude or rustic (Елено, Богдано). Nevertheless, nominative forms (especially the male ones) sound too formal, even snobbish, and are used rarely by native speakers. Instead, diminutives (Еленче, Богданче) or short forms (Ели, Боби) are preferred. Diminutives are used usually by elder people, when addressing younger ones.\n\nMale vocative forms and female ones ending in е are used regularly and their substitution with nominative forms is also considered a gross error (or the speaker may sound too snobbish).\n\nThere is difference between the vocative form of both male and female short name forms and their other, non-vocative form (the form that is used in all other cases). The latter takes the definite article -та or -то, depending on the ending:\n\n", "id": "7710308", "categories": ["Bulgarian grammar"], "title": "Bulgarian nouns"}

Moreover, The University has 14 Research Institutes in which primary research activities are conducted.\n\nThe origin of UNSJ was a Preparatory College founded in 1839 by then-governor (then president of Argentina) Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. The faculty of Mineralogy of this college gave rise to the technical School of Mines, which in turn fathered other teaching institutions. In 1939 the National University of Cuyo (UNCuyo) was founded with its seat in Mendoza, and San Juan Province was included in its area of influence; UNCuyo's Faculty of Engineering started functioning in San Juan in 1947. Also in that year, courses to form professors in Sciences and Letters began at the Sarmiento Normal School. These courses were split from the school, to be dictated at the newly created National Institute of the Secondary School Professorship, in 1958.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the society of San Juan Province strived to achieve the creation of a national university.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710343", "text": "Land banking\n\nLand banking is the practice of aggregating parcels of land for future sale or development.\n\nWhile in many countries \"land banking\" may refer to various private real-estate investment schemes, in the United States it refers to the establishment of quasi-governmental county or municipal authorities purposed with managing an inventory of surplus land.\n\nLand banks are quasi-governmental entities created by counties or municipalities to effectively manage and repurpose an inventory of underused, abandoned, or foreclosed property. They are often chartered to have powers that enable them to accomplish these goals in ways that existing government agencies can not. While the land bank \"model\" has gained broad support and has been implemented in a number of cities, they are implemented differently so as to best address both municipal needs and the state and local legal context in which they were created.\n\nThe period of deindustrialization in the United States coupled with increased suburbanization in the middle of the 20th century left many American cities with large amounts of vacant & blighted industrial, residential, and commercial property. Beginning in the early 1970s municipalities began to seek solutions to manage decline or spur revitalization in once prosperous city neighborhoods. The first land bank was created in St. Louis in 1971. While additional municipalities continued to adopt them at a trickle it wasn’t until the mid 2000s that land banks became viewed as a tested, reliable, and accepted model and experienced widespread implementation – particularly after the success of the Genesee County Land Bank. In 2009 the Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a report embracing land banks as a best practices model for municipalities dealing with the effects of the real estate market collapse and the ensuing foreclosure crisis.\n\nLand banking in the UK was previously the preserve of the landed gentry or real estate developers. Many reputable listed commercial building companies engage successfully in land banking for future building projects. Companies also purchase land sites and easily divide them into smaller plots, then offer these plots for sale to individual investors. This relatively new practice in the UK does not fall under the control of the Financial Services Authority. Many people are wary of this form of investment as many plot based land banking companies have failed or been closed down. There are currently no audited successes recorded for UK plot based land banking despite the UK having gone through a major property boom in the period 2002 – Jul 2007.\n\nA landbanking scheme that is a Collective investment scheme is a \"regulated activity\" for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and, according to section 19(1), may only be operated in the UK by a person who is either authorised or exempt. Section 26 provides that an agreement made by a person in contravention of this is unenforceable and any sums paid to him may be recovered together with compensation for any loss suffered. After recent FSA enforcement of this regulation many companies selling UK land plots have moved outside of the European Union and only offer land plots to non UK residents who are not protected by FSA regulations.\n\nSince the changes in the land registration act, a number of companies offering UK land plots as an investment have been formed. Typically this land is greenbelt, nature conservation, flood plain, agricultural or protected land unsuitable for development. There are no recorded successful planning permission applications for plots sold under such collective investment schemes.\n\nThere have been considerable losses recorded by investors in UK land plot investment schemes. A large number of British companies offering UK land plots have failed or been shut down by the FSA or other authorities.\nSome companies have now moved offshore after FSA investigation. Some companies now offer UK land plots from locations such as Dubai or Singapore where the local authorities do not regulate such activities, or are not aware of the high risk nature of the investment. In June 2010 the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued a warning on land banking plots schemes warning they may be a scam with specific focus on companies offering land from the UK and Canada.\n\nA company representative may contact an individual by telephone, in temporary shopping center booths, or at property shows and offer a strategic land investment in the UK. Very often UK government or industry statistics, the proximity of the land to built up areas, or the recent history of UK house prices are quoted as a demonstration of why the land plot is a great investment. Verbal communication will often indicate that the land is fast tracked for building approval and has strong potential as building land. When pricing the land reference is typically made to approved building land prices at the market peak. Very often the land banking company will present detailed plans showing a housing development on the site. These plans are often referred to as \"pre-approved\", \"concept\" or \"predevelopment\". The sales person will focus on the potential future value of the land against the current selling price.\n\nNo reference is ever made to the value of green belt or agricultural land, or the issues involved with the long term maintenance, and collectively selling tiny plots of land. The sales price is typically uplifted 10–100 times over the current value of the land. Plans shown have no validity in UK planning law and cannot be considered as any indication of progress in the planning process. No written contractual promise is ever given for planning permission despite typically extreme optimism by the sales person. The sales person will typically never mention that the land is protected, or greenbelt land and cannot be developed under current planning regulations. There is typically no possibility of planning permission in any reasonable timeframe.\n\nThe investor may end up paying a considerable amount of money for a small area of low value land which has a very high risk of standing undeveloped. Once the general public becomes aware of the lack of viability of the proposed plot investment scheme, the re-sale value of the individual plots collapses. This is typically followed by the land plot company liquidating completely, or relocating to another legal jurisdiction.\n\nFor customers that show a willingness to purchase such schemes there may also be attempts to sell additional plot based land banking products at alternate locations, or other high yield investment programmes. Customers may also be added to suckers lists which are then sold to other companies offering similar schemes. When the land banking plot company fails plot investors may also be offered investment recovery or planning services for a fee. Such services typically are fraudulent or fail and lead to a further loss of money for the investor.\n\nA \"You and Yours\" documentary, first aired on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006, criticized the services offered by many land banking companies in the United Kingdom, suggesting that they were scamming their customers. A land banking scam is based on the very low chance of any of the plots receiving planning permission and the very high profit margins taken on the land plots, with the seller using misleading marketing tactics to convince the buyers that they are making a sound investment.\n\nA key strategy used for selling United Kingdom land plots is to imply that because a customer owns the land plot, they cannot lose their money. The land banking company typically suggests dramatic annual increases in the value of the land plots, and a very optimistic time frame for successful planning applications. These are never contractually committed. Typically the land banking company sells a land plot at a premium of 15 to 100 times the current market value of undeveloped land. A purchaser might pay £15,000 for a land plot that only has a current market value of £500. On this basis, most of the investment is not in land, and the small percentage annual increases in the value of the land plot are meaningless. The actual investment is in a proposed service to deliver valuable approved building land in the future. If that service is never delivered or is not successful, the remaining land asset is normally worthless. Should the selling company fail or disappear, the plot owner cannot economically sell the plot, as the administrative effort and cost of sale typically exceeds the value of the land plot.\n\nMany land banking companies target victims outside of the United Kingdom, particularly Canada, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and Malaysia. Residents of these countries may be naive of the UK property market and local planning regulations such as green belt zoning.\n\nIn 2008, the land banking firm UKLI was placed into administration due to insolvency, despite having taken £69 million from 4,500 people for land plots. Land International was closed down in 2008 after losing investors £10 million, and the same Land International plots were later offered for sale in Asia. In 2010, Land International (Far East) failed, causing investors to lose S$6 million (£2.5M). MP David Heath requested a debate in the House of Commons following the offering of 209 plots in the village of Dean, saying that \"while land banking may not be illegal it is undoubtedly a scam\".\n\nThe UK Land Registry issued a press release on January 15, 2009 advising consumers that the Land Registry has published a guide warning against land banking investment schemes. Land Registry Head of Corporate Legal Services Mike Westcott Rudd said that the public were being \"misled about the prospects of obtaining planning permission\", with well-known banks and developers being falsely cited as partners in the project, and that in some cases forged Land Registry paperwork was being presented to suggest that planning approval existed where it did not.\n\nIn 2011 New York State passed a land bank statute authorizing the establishment of nonprofits in each county to take title to vacant abandoned homes so they can be rehabilitated, sold or demolished in an orderly fashion. Many counties upstate including Erie County, Onondaga County, Schenectady County and Albany County have abandoned homes as people moved to the suburbs. Some properties have been abandoned due to back taxes and the city has taken title. \n\nThe recent robo-signing settlement gave Attorney General Eric Schneiderman the wherewithal to fund land banks in Schenectady and Albany. \n\nThe state of Michigan also has a land bank program . Ohio passed land bank legislation in 2009.\n\nLand banking as an investment is nothing new to America. Several self-made billionaires started by purchasing large tracts in California where the development opportunities had not yet arisen. People such as Bob Hope and Donald Trump have reaped tremendous reward from buying large areas and holding the property until the market commanded a considerable return when sold. There have however, also been many land scams in the US, such as the large areas of Florida swampland which were sold as being suitable for real estate.\n\nFlorida land scams have history as far back as the 1920s Florida Land Rush. Many Florida Counties have traces of these land scams today. Polk County Florida in particular has been devastated with land banking scams. Polk County, being the land that lies between the city of Tampa, in Hillsborough County Florida and the city of Orlando, in Orange County Florida has been a hot bed for speculative land development. North Polk County falls within the lower Green Swamp. The State of Florida has declared the Green Swamp \"land of critical state concern\". During the 1970s through the late 1980s the Green Swamp was sold as being suitable for real estate development. The development of Disney World and the attraction it received was the sales tool to persuade individuals to buy one acre lots at high speculative prices. These prices ranged from $2,000 to as high as $15,000 per acre. The Florida land banking scams continue today and are mostly operated outside of the United States. Unwary foreign customers are sold Florida land from outside the U.S. borders through contracts for deed arrangements.\n\nIn December 2008, at the depths of the Global Financial Crisis, the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) relaxed laws regarding foreign investment in Australian real estate. Under previous legislation temporary residents were only allowed to purchase a property for Principal Place of Residence purposes valued at up to $300,000. Under new laws active since February 2009, this monetary limit has been removed.\n\nIn March 2010, the Reserve Bank of Australia governor announced that it is monitoring the effect of the rule change on the housing market.\n\nOn April 24, 2010, Assistant Treasurer Senator Nick Sherry announced the tightening of foreign investment laws as a result of a public backlash to the changes made a year earlier. Whilst they are still entitled to purchase a property of any value, temporary Residents must now sell their residence upon leaving the country, and must report all purchases to the Foreign Investment Review Board, effectively eliminating this land banking loophole. However, foreign companies are allowed to purchase property to house local staff.\n\nIt is possible for foreign individuals to create a registered company for the sole purpose of purchasing property in Australia and actively bypass the loophole fix.\n\nAs of April 20, 2010, the COAG has agreed the Housing Supply and Affordability Reform Working Party will extend the land audit work to examine ‘underused examine private holdings of large parcels of land by mid-2010.\n\nWhile most land banking is based on the prospect of urban areas expanding at the expense of rural areas, in various parts of the world agricultural land is expanding at the expense of virgin land. The purchase of virgin land that has been identified as suitable for agriculture because of its climate, topography and soil properties, where the buyer has no intention to work the land himself or lease it out, would be agricultural land banking.\n\nSuch lands are often rather far away from existing infrastructure when purchased by the land banking investor, therefore prices being low. The investor anticipates that, because of the area's natural productive potential, an agricultural infrastructure (sufficient roads, specialised contractors, grain storages) will develop, with more land put under cultivation and land values multiplying.\n\nAgricultural land banking is found where large tracts of fertile virgin land still exist, where valuations are low and where legislation allows large land holdings (free hold) by domestic and foreign investors.\nTypical countries for such investments during recent years have been Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay,\nParaguay where land prices appreciated accordingly.\n\nThough the perception that the world's fertile land is a limited and valuable asset is by no means new, it received renewed public and media attention with the global food crisis, when phrases like \"peak wheat\" or \"peak soil\"\nwere coined.\n\n\n", "id": "7710343", "categories": ["Agricultural economics", "Land use", "Investment", "Scams"], "title": "Land banking"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710370", "text": "Suppressor mutation\n\nA suppressor mutation is a second mutation that alleviates or reverts the phenotypic effects of an already existing mutation in a process defined synthetic rescue. Genetic suppression therefore restores the phenotype seen prior to the original background mutation. Suppressor mutations are useful for identifying new genetic sites which affect a biological process of interest. They also provide evidence between functionally interacting molecules and intersecting biological pathways.\n\nIntragenic suppression results from suppressor mutations that occur in the same gene as the original mutation. In a classic study, Francis Crick (et al.) used intragenic suppression to study the fundamental nature of the genetic code. From this study it was shown that genes are expressed as non-overlapping triplets (codons). \nResearchers showed that mutations caused by either a single base insertion (+) or a single base deletion (-) could be \"suppressed\" or restored by a second mutation of the opposite sign, as long as the two mutations occurred in the same vicinity of the gene. This led to the conclusion that genes needed to be read in a specific \"reading frame\" and a single base insertion or deletion would shift the reading frame (frameshift mutation) in such a way that the remaining DNA would code for a different polypeptide than the one intended. Therefore, researchers concluded that the second mutation of opposite sign suppresses the original mutation by restoring the reading frame, as long as the portion between the two mutations is not critical for protein function. \n\nIn addition to the reading frame, Crick also used suppressor mutations to determine codon size. It was found that while one and two base insertions/deletions of the same sign resulted in a mutant phenotype, deleting or inserting three bases could give a wild type phenotype. From these results it was concluded that an inserted or deleted triplet does not disturb the reading frame and the genetic code is in fact a triplet.\n\nIntergenic (also known as extragenic) suppression relieves the effects of a mutation in one gene by a mutation somewhere else within the genome. The second mutation is not on the same gene as the original mutation. Intergenic suppression is useful for identifying and studying interactions between molecules, such as proteins. For example, a mutation which disrupts the complementary interaction between protein molecules may be compensated for by a second mutation elsewhere in the genome that restores or provides a suitable alternative interaction between those molecules. Several proteins of biochemical, signal transduction, and gene expression pathways have been identified using this approach. Examples of such pathways include receptor-ligand interactions as well as the interaction of components involved in DNA replication, transcription, and translation.\n\nSuppressor mutations also occur in genes that code for virus structural proteins. To create a viable phage T4 virus (see image), a balance of structural components is required. An amber mutant of phage T4 contains a mutation that changes a codon for an amino acid in a protein to the nonsense stop codon TAG (see stop codon and nonsense mutation). If, upon infection, an amber mutant defective in a gene encoding a needed structural component of phage T4 is weakly suppressed (in an \"E. coli\" host containing a specific altered tRNA – see nonsense suppressor), it will produce a reduced number of the needed structural component. As a consequence few if any viable phage are formed. However, it was found that viable phage could sometimes be produced in the host with the weak nonsense suppressor if a second amber mutation in a gene that encodes another structural protein is also present in the phage genome. It was found that the reason the second amber mutation could suppress the first one is that the two numerically reduced structural proteins would now be in balance. For instance, if the first amber mutation caused a reduction of tail fibers to one tenth the normal level, most phage particles produced would have insufficient tail fibers to be infective. However, if a second amber mutation is defective in a base plate component and causes one tenth the number of base plates to be made, this may restore the balance of tail fibers and base plates, and thus allow infective phage to be produced.\n\nIn microbial genetics, a revertant is a mutant that has reverted to its former genotype or to the original phenotype by means of a suppressor mutation, or else by compensatory mutation somewhere in the gene (second site reversion).\n\n\n", "id": "7710370", "categories": ["Molecular genetics", "Evolutionary biology", "Mutation"], "title": "Suppressor mutation"}

It is also known as the indoor city (ville intérieure), as not all of it is underground. With over of tunnels spread over an area of , the 60 residential and commercial complexes comprise of floor space, including 80% of all office space and 35% of all commercial space in downtown Montreal. Services include shopping malls, hotels, banks, offices, museums, universities, seven metro stations, two commuter train stations, a bus terminal and the Bell Centre hockey arena. There are more than 120 exterior access points to the underground city. Some 500,000 people use the underground city every day, especially to escape the traffic and/or Montreal's harsh winter.\n\nThe Olympic installations site is next to Metro Pie-IX and Metro Viau, from downtown in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district, and consists of several buildings designed by French architect Roger Taillibert. The Olympic Stadium is ovoid shaped with a distinctive 'ribbed' look, and has the world's tallest inclined tower at high; it leans at 45 degrees. The complex includes the Montreal Biodome (originally a fully functional Velodrome), the Montreal Insectarium, municipal golf course Le Village, and the Montreal Botanical Garden, one of the largest botanical gardens in the world, second only to Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in England. Two pyramidal towers, known as the Olympic Village, were built to house athletes but now serve as apartments and offices.\n\nThe Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics were successful, but construction problems and corruption created a massive financial burden for citizens. At the opening, the tower and the retractable roof were incomplete. The tower was completed years later but the retractable roof was never completed as originally planned by Taillibert. Anglo locals refer to the stadium as the \"Big O\" due to its shape, but also as the \"Big Owe\" — a reference to the Olympic Park's exorbitant total cost, which was only paid off thirty years later with the help of a special tobacco tax.\n\nThe stadium was also home to the Expos from 1977 until the team moved to Washington, D.C. after the 2004 season, and has sometimes been home for the Montreal Alouettes. Today, Montreal's Olympic Park hosts limited professional sports events and is mainly a tourist and cultural attraction.\n\nMontreal hosted the 2006 1st World Outgames holding the opening/closing ceremonies and many of the events at the Olympic Stadium. The event drew over 10,000 participants. Most were Gay athletes, but many participated in other cultural events such as ballroom dancing. Opening ceremonies brought international athletes, local politicians, and entertainers.\n\nMontreal is the centre of Quebec culture and a major centre of Canadian culture in general. It has many specialized museums such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA), the Musée d'art contemporain (MAC), the Redpath Museum, the Stewart Museum, the McCord Museum of Canadian History, and the Canadian Centre for Architecture. The Place des Arts cultural complex houses the MAC and several theatres, and is the seat of the Montreal Opera and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, although the latter is slated to receive a new concert hall adjacent to Place des Arts. The Museum Quarter’s historical and architectural richness, spilling over into surrounding streets, creates a special ambiance that leaves a lasting impression on visitors. Crescent, de la Montagne and Sherbrooke Streets are the hub of the district’s vibrant business life. High-end, designer fashion and décor boutiques, international shops, art galleries, jewellers and exquisite fine dining never fail to win visitors over.\n\nNicknamed \"la ville aux cent clochers\" (\"the city of a hundred belltowers\"), Montreal is renowned for its churches. As described by Mark Twain, \"This is the first time I was ever in a city where you couldn't throw a brick without breaking a church window.\" The city has four Roman Catholic basilicas: Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, the aforementioned Notre-Dame Basilica, St. Patrick's Basilica, and Saint Joseph's Oratory.\nThe Oratory is the largest church in Canada, with the largest dome of its kind in the world after that of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\nOther well-known churches include the pilgrimage church of Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Secours, which is sometimes called the Sailors' Church, the Church of St. Michael and St. Anthony, known for its Byzantine architecture, and the Anglican Christ Church Cathedral, which was completely excavated and suspended in mid-air during the construction of part of the Underground City. All of the above are major tourist destinations, particularly Notre-Dame and the Oratory.\n\nAn impressive number of other churches, synagogues and mosques can be found, and church steeples are a familiar view all over the city and island.\n\nMount Royal is Montreal's outstanding urban park, designed in 1876 by Frederick Law Olmsted, best known as the designer of New York's Central Park. Mount Royal's features include the Chalet and the Kondiaronk Belvedere overlooking downtown Montreal (the most famous view of the city), and man-made Beaver Lake (Lac aux Castors) with its recently renovated pavilion. Mount Royal is topped by an illuminated cross that has become a Montreal landmark.\n\nObservant hikers on the park's many trails will find an abundance of small wildlife. In the winter, the park is the site of numerous cross-country ski trails and a new, refrigerated skating rink near Beaver Lake.\n\nOnce, a funicular railroad brought sightseers to its peak, but has long since disappeared. A tramway also went up the mountain on the north side, replaced in the late 1950s by the Camillien Houde Parkway, which now bisects the mountain (the parkway is named for long-time but controversial former mayor, jailed during World War II for his opposition to conscription in Canada). The \"11-Montagne\" bus line perpetuates the route of the tram.\n\nEvery Sunday in the summer, hundreds of people gather at the George-Étienne Cartier Monument, a statue of Confederation co-founder George-Étienne Cartier at the foot of Mount Royal, for several hours of drumming, dancing, and juggling (among many other activities) in an event known as the Tam-Tams. It is unclear how this event started; but, as it has no formal organization and has carried on both in a lively and peaceful way since at least the late 1980s.\n\nThe intersection of Avenue du Parc and Avenue des Pins, just to the south, formerly a winding urban interchange (inspired by the New York parkways of Robert Moses), underwent a major transformation to become more pedestrian-friendly.\n\nLocated in the middle of the St. Lawrence River, Parc Jean-Drapeau consists of the islands of Sainte-Hélène and the manmade Notre-Dame, which hosted Expo 67. A large green space with diverse attractions and events, Parc Jean-Drapeau is accessible by métro, car, bicycle or boat. The islands are a popular destination for Montrealers due to their green spaces and sports and cultural activities.\n\nThe Floralies gardens are located at the centre of the island. Île Notre-Dame also has a network of canals, and, further west at the lake, offers a beach and other water sports. The Casino de Montréal and a youth hostel are also located here. The Montreal Grand Prix takes place here at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, which in winter is used as a skating rink.\n\nDominated by the geodesic dome of the Biosphère and the rollercoasters of Six Flags La Ronde, the island is also home to the Hélène de Champlain restaurant and the De Lévis tower. Built in 1814, the Fort on Saint Helen's Island houses the Stewart Museum, dedicated to the history of New France. The island also contains several large public works of art, such as the imposing \"Man\", sculpted in steel by artist Alexander Calder. Buses run every 15 minutes from the Jean-Drapeau metro station to La Ronde.\n\n", "id": "7710378", "categories": ["Tourist attractions in Montreal"], "title": "Landmarks of Montreal"}

These recordings might be stored in university offices or in private homes where they are not accessible to others. AILLA provides a permanent home for these recordings in order to make them available to the speakers and to the rest of the world via the Internet. \n\nAILLA's mission is three-fold:\n\n\nThe collection currently contains roughly 7,500 hours of archived audio materials, representing more than 300 languages from at least 28 countries. This is supplemented by a significant number of images, videos, and text files. Altogether, the archive contains more than 110,000 individual files (correct as of June 2016).\n\nThe database of archived materials can be freely searched via both the English and Spanish portals available on the AILLA webpage, as well as the Open Languages Archives Community. Direct access to archived recordings requires free registration and sometimes needs permission as specified by the depositor. Downloads are free of charge.\n\nA large part of the project is the digitization of valuable analog recordings of languages and cultures from the Latin America that will otherwise deteriorate or be lost. Researchers whose materials are represented in these collections include Terrence Kaufman, Lyle Campbell, and Nora England, among many others.\n\nAnalog recordings are digitized at the highest possible fidelity to ensure high-quality digital files result. The current international archive standard for PCM audio files is 24-bit resolution and a sample rate of 96 kHz. AILLA employs the same standard to ensure that digital copies of the highest practicable fidelity are produced.\n\nAILLA is funded by the College of Liberal Arts and the University of Texas Libraries at The University of Texas at Austin. AILLA's main office is located at the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection. The archive is currently headed by Susan Smythe Kung, Joel Sherzer, Anthony C. Woodbury, and Patience Epps.\n\nAILLA was founded in 2001 by Joel Sherzer, professor emeritus in the Department of Linguistics at The University of Texas at Austin. The archive is a member of the Digital Endangered Languages and Musics Archives Network (DELAMAN). AILLA is an archive of record for the Documenting Endangered Languages program of the National Science Foundation.\n\n", "id": "7710503", "categories": ["Mesoamerican studies", "University of Texas at Austin", "Indigenous rights organizations in the Americas", "Language revival", "Mesoamerican languages", "Sound archives", "Multilingual websites", "Linguistics organizations", "Endangered languages projects"], "title": "Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America"}

Alex Müller, discovered high-temperature superconductivity in ceramics, for which they shared the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nBednorz was born in Neuenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany to elementary-school teacher Anton and piano teacher Elisabeth Bednorz, as the youngest of four children. His parents were both from Silesia in Central Europe, but were forced to move westwards in turbulences of World War II.\n\nAs a child, his parents tried to get him interested in classical music, but he was more practically inclined preferring to work on motorcycles and cars. (Although as a teenager he did eventually learn to play the violin and trumpet.) In high school he developed an interest in the natural sciences, focusing on chemistry, which he could learn in a hands-on manner through experiments.\n\nIn 1968, Bednorz enrolled at the University of Münster to study chemistry. However, he soon felt lost in the large body of students and opt to switch to the much less popular subject of crystallography, a subfield of mineralogy at the interface of chemistry and physics. In 1972, his teachers Wolfgang Hoffmann and Horst Böhm arranged for him to spend the summer at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory as a visiting student. The experience here would shape his further career, not only did he meet his later collaborator K. Alex Müller, the head of the physics department, but he also experienced the atmosphere of creativity and freedom cultivated at the IBM lab which he credits as a strong influence on his way of conducting science.\n\nAfter another visit in 1973, he came to Zurich in 1974 for six months to do the experimental part of his diploma work. Here he grew crystals of SrTiO, a ceramic material belonging to the family of perovskites. Müller, himself interested in perovskites, urged him to continue his research, and after obtaining his master's degree from Münster in 1977 Bednorz started a PhD at the ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) under supervision of Heini Gränicher and Alex Müller. In 1978, his future wife, Mechthild Wennemer, whom he had met in Münster, followed him to Zürich to start her own PhD.\n\nIn 1982, after obtaining his PhD, he joined the IBM lab. There, he joined Müller's ongoing research on superconductivity. In 1983, Bednorz and Müller began a systematic study of the electrical properties of ceramics formed from transition metal oxides, and in 1986 they succeeded in inducing superconductivity in a lanthanum barium copper oxide (LaBaCuO, also known as LBCO). The oxide's critical temperature (T) was 35 K, a full 12 K higher than the previous record. This discovery stimulated a great deal of additional research in high-temperature superconductivity on cuprate materials with structures similar to LBCO, soon leading to the discovery of compounds such as BSCCO (T 107K) and YBCO (T 92K).\n\nIn 1987, Bednorz and Müller were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for their important break-through in the discovery of superconductivity in ceramic materials\". In the same year Bednorz was appointed an IBM Fellow.\n\n\n", "id": "7710506", "categories": ["German physicists", "Experimental physicists", "People from Steinfurt (district)", "ETH Zurich alumni", "1950 births", "IBM Fellows", "German Nobel laureates", "Living people", "Nobel laureates in Physics", "IBM employees"], "title": "Georg Bednorz"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710512", "text": "Muted group theory\n\nMuted Group Theory (MGT), created by Edwin Ardener and Shirley Ardener in 1975, is a communication theory that focuses on how marginalized groups are muted and excluded via the use of language. The main idea of MGT is that \"Language serves its creators better than those in other groups who have to learn to use the language as best they can.\"\n\nThe term “mutedness” refers to a group’s inability to express themselves due to this inequity. The theory describes the relationship between a dominant group and its subordinate group(s) as being as follows: 1) the dominant group contributes mostly to the formulation of the language system, including the social norms and vocabulary, and 2) members from the subordinate group have to learn and use the dominant language to express themselves. However, this translation process may result in the loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly. The dominant group may also ignore the voice of the marginalized group. All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group. Although this theory was initially developed to study the different situations faced by women and men, it can also be applied to any marginalized group that is muted by the inadequacies of their languages.\n\nMuted Group Theory was firstly developed in the field of cultural anthropology by the British anthropologist, Edwin Ardener. The first formulation of MGT emerges from one of Edwin Ardener's short essays, entitled \"Belief and the Problem of Women,\" in which Ardener explored the \"problem\" of women. In social anthropology, the problem of women is divided in two parts: technical and analytical. The technical problem is that although half of the population and society is technically made up of women, ethnographers have often ignored this half of the population. Ardener writes that \"those trained in ethnography evidently have a bias towards the kinds of model that men are ready to provide (or to concur in) rather than towards any that women might provide.\" He also suggests that the reason behind this is that men tend to give a \"bounded model of society\" akin to the ones that ethnographers are attracted to. Therefore, men are those who produce and control symbolic production in a society. This leads to the analytical part of the problem which attempts to answer the question: \"[…] if the models of society made by most ethnographers tend to be models derived from the male portion of that society, how does the symbolic weight of the other mass of persons express itself?\"\n\nAfter conducting an experiment with the information in his essay, the results indicated that the male point of view is the dominant point of view in society, which is why it is depicted with a standard solid line in this graph. On the other hand, the female point of view is considered as non-dominant and non-standard, so it falls into the muted category with the broken line. According to Ardener, because male-based understandings of society represent the dominant worldview, certain groups are silenced or muted. He writes: \"In these terms if the male perception yields a dominant structure, the female one is a muted structure.\" As part of the critical approach to the world, Ardener uses MGT to explore the power and societal structure in relation to the dynamism between dominant and subordinated groups. Moreover, Ardener's concept of muted groups does not only apply to women but can also be applied to other non-dominant groups within social structures.\n\nScholars Cheris Kramerae, Barrie Thorne and Nancy Henley were interested in exploring ways language “defines, deprecrates, and ignores women”. What they discovered is that \"male dominance affects more than just the way sexes speak but the content and structure of the English language. Women are often defined by their relation to men (“Miss/Mrs.” or “Harold’s Widow”) while men have more autonomous varied linguistic status.\"\n\nMutedness does not equal silence. Mutedness occurs when people cannot articulate their ideas, regardless of time and space, without changing their language to meet the dominant group's vocabulary. Mutedness results from the lack of power and might lead to being overlooked, muffled, and invisible. As gender communication scholar Cheris Kramarae states, social interaction and communication create the current language structure. Because the latter was mainly built by men, men have an advantage over women. Consequently, women cannot express their thoughts through their own words because their language use is limited by the rules of a man's language. Kramarae states:\n\n\"The language of a particular culture does not serve all its speakers equally, for not all speakers contribute in an equal fashion to its formulation. Women (as well as members of other non-dominant groups) are not as free or as able as men are to say what they wish, because the words and the norms for their use have been formulated by the dominant group, men.\"\n\nAs Cowan points out, \" 'mutedness' does not refer to the absence of voice but to a kind of distortion where subordinate voices…are allowed to speak but only in the confines of the dominant communication system.\"\n\nMuted group or subordinated group is relative to the dominant group. According to Gerdrin, muting or silencing is a social phenomenon based on the tacit understanding that within a society there are dominant and non-dominant groups. Thus, the muting process is a socially shared phenomenon that presupposes a collective understanding of who is in power and who is not. The discrepancies in power result in the \"oppressor\" and \"the oppressed\". Kramarae points out that muted group as \"the oppressed\" are people who don't have a \"public recognized vocabulary\" to express their experience. Their failure in articulate their ideas lead to their doubt about \"the validity of their experience\" and \"the legitimacy of their feelings\". Kramarae also addresses that gender, race, and class hierarchies, where muted groups, are supported by our \"political, educational, religious, legal, and media systems\". Due to the lack of power, muted groups are usually at the margin of the society.\n\nSeveral scholars have researched and studied how the \"muting\" process occurs. Houston and Kramarae posit that women have been silenced in many ways by for example ridiculing women's related lexicon, reinforcing family hierarchies, constructing a male-controlled media, trivializing their opinions, ideas, and concerns, and censoring women's voices. A central factor that contributes to these silencing methods is the trivialization of the lexicon and speech patterns that is often used to describe female activities.\n\nAccording to West and Turner (2010), individuals can use the following strategies to avoid the \"muting\" process: \n\nAccording to Cheris Kramarae, MGT makes three assumptions :\n\n\"The different experiences caused by the division of labor result in the different perceptions that women and men hold towards the world\"\n\nUsing men's words is a disadvantage to women because Kramarae believes that men and women are vastly different and thus will view the world differently from each other. This stems from the distinction between the meanings of the words \"sex\" and \"gender\". Kramerae believes that communication between men and women is not on an even level. This is because language is man made. This makes it easier for men to communicate over women. Symbolic Interactionism Theory believes that \"the extent of knowing is the extent of naming.\" When applied to muted group, this means women have an extreme disadvantage over men because men are the namers.\n\n\"Women find it difficult to articulate their ideas as men's experience are dominant\"\n\nKramarae argues that English is a \"[hu]man-made language\" and that it \"embodies the perspectives of the masculine more than the feminine\", while supporting \"the perceptions of white middle-class males. Men are the standard.\" In other words, Kramerae argues that men use language to dominate women, so that women's voices become less present, or \"muted\". Kramarae also explains that men's control over language has produced an abundance of derogatory words for women and their speech patterns. Some of these include names such as \"slut\", \"whore\", and \"easy lay\", along with speech patterns such as \"gossiping\", \"whining\", and \"bitching\". When it comes to words connoting promiscuity, there are fewer male-specific terms and the ones that do exist are seen in a positive/sexual light. These include words such as \"stud\", \"player\", and \"pimp\" (p. 465). Kramarae suggests these harmful words shape our reality. She believes that \"words constantly ignored may eventually come to be unspoken and perhaps even unthought\". This can lead women to doubt themselves and the intentions of their feelings. Women are at a disadvantage once again.\n\n\"Women have to go through a translation process when speaking in order to participate in social life\"\n\nKramarae says that women need to choose their words carefully in public. According to Kramarae, this is because, \"what women want to say and can say best cannot be said easily because the language template is not of their own making.\" Another example of the male-dominated language Kramarae brings up is that in public speaking, women most often use sports and war analogies (things most women do not usually associate themselves with) in order to relate to their male audiences. This stems from the market being dominated by males for so long. Almost all prominent authors, theorists, and scientists have historically been male. This allows for them to give women the \"facts\" they should believe about society and life in general. Kramarae also believes that \"males have more difficulty than females in understanding what members of the other gender mean.\" Feminist scholar Dale Spender supports the idea that language, and society in general, is traditionally male-centric. \"Masculinity is the unmarked form: the assumption is that the world is male unless proven otherwise. Femininity is the marked form: it is the proof of otherwise.\" If masculinity, and subsequently language, are unmarked forms, than any marked form must go through a translation process in order to participate in social life.\n\nAccording to Kissack, traditionally communication has been constructed within the framework of a male dominated society. Women in corporate organizations are expected to use language associated with women, that is, \"female-preferential\" language. It has been considered as lower than the \"male-preferential\" language. The primary difference between the two is \"male-preferential\" language consists of details such as opinions and facts whereas \"female-preferential\" language consists mainly of personal details, emotions reflected in the conversations, also there is a great use of adjectives in it.\n\nMuted group theory has \"recognized that women's voices are muted in Western society so that their experiences are not fully represented in language and has argued that women's experiences merit linguistic recognition\". Kramarae states that in order to change muted group status we also need to change dictionaries. Traditional dictionaries rely on the majority of their information to come from male literary sources. These male sources have the power to exclude words important to or created by women. Furthering this idea, Kramarae and Paula Treichler created A Feminist Dictionary with words they believed Merriam-Webster defined on male ideas. For example, the word \"Cuckold\" is defined as \"the husband of an unfaithful wife\" in Merriam Webster. However, there is no term for a wife who has an unfaithful husband. She is simply called a wife. Another example Kramarae defined was the word \"doll\". She defined \"doll\" as \"a toy playmate given to, or made by children\". Some adult males continue their childhood by labeling adult female companions \"dolls\". The feminist dictionary includes up to 2,500 words to emphasize women's linguistic ability and to give women words of empowerment and change their muted status. Long argues that words can shape reality and feelings. She also believes that women can grab opportunities to take up physical and political space if they are given more verbal space.\n\nAccording to Kramarae, women have been locked out of the publishing business until 1970; thus they lacked influence on mass media and have often been misrepresented in history. The reason behind this lies in the predominance of male gatekeepers, who are defined as editors and other arbiters of a culture who determine which books, essays, poetry, plays, film scripts, etc. will appear in the mass media. Similarly, Pamela Creedon argues that in the mid-70s there is an increase of women in the male-dominated profession of journalism.\n\nIn The Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2014, The Women's Media Centre researchers explore the current status of women in the mass media industry. The report compiles 27,000 pieces of content among \"20 of the most widely circulated, read, and viewed, and listened TV networks, newspapers, news wires, and online news in the United States.\" The results show that women (36.1%) are significantly out-numbered by men (63.4%). Although the number of women on TV news broadcasts is generally growing, the misrepresentation of women does not only regard their presence as anchors but also the events that they cover. Several studies show that while men mainly report on \"hard\" news, women are often relegated to cover \"soft\" news. Thus, women are often muted in terms of the topics they tend to cover.\n\nAlthough the Women's Media Centre study is very U.S.-centric, non-dominant groups are often muted even in other country's media landscapes. For example, Aparna Hebbani and Charise-Rose Wills have explored how Muslim women have often been muted in the Australian mass media sphere. Their study shows that women that wear a hijab or burqa are often inaccurately and negatively connoted in Australian mass media. According to the authors, Muslim women represent a muted group and thus cannot entirely incorporate their experiences, views, and perspective in their representation in Australian media. Thus, there is a social hierarchy that is privileging certain groups via Australian mass media. It also shows that although currently muted, this group is attempting to gain a voice in this media landscape by engaging and interacting with members of the dominant culture in order to negotiate their silenced position.\n\nThere are some conventional stereotypes attached to men and women in society when an individual's behavior deviates from this norm they attain \"negative feedback\" for this opposition to the norm by their actions. In the case of women, this gets quite complicated as women are told to act in a certain manner, but when they do try and emulate their male counterparts, they are \"discriminated\" and \"discouraged\" for acting that way.\n\nSocial rituals are another example of a place in which the muting process takes place. Kramarae suggests that many elements within wedding ceremonies place women in a silenced position. For example, the fact that the father of the bride \"gives her away\" to the groom, that the position of the bride – at the left of the minister – is considered less privileged than the one of the groom, that the groom announces his vows first, and that the groom is asked to kiss the bride, are all factors that contribute to the position of a woman as subordinated to the one of the man.\n\nAs Catharine MacKinnon (one of the leading voices in the feminist legal movement ) suggests, the law sees women similarly as men see women. Like language, the legal system has thus been created, defined, and interpreted mostly by men. In the context of unequal power relations between men and women, MacKinnon proposes new standards to define and evaluate sexual harassment and sex-related issues considered as the consequence of unwanted impositions of sexual requirements. Finley argues that there has been a recent interest in feminist jurisprudence and legal scholarship inspired by the law's failure to see that despite the legal removal of barriers, sexes are not socially equal.\n\nIn 1940s America, women entered the workplace in great numbers while men were at war. However, after the war period, the society did not encourage the participation of women in the workplace, and in this way tried to assert male dominance in the society. Organizations still appear to be male dominated. Women's experiences are often not taken into account in the workplace the way male experiences are. The \"structure\" is maintained by men who primarily use communication from the male perspective.\n\nMost organization goals are met by the usage of \"male-preferential\" language, as they tend to focus on aspects such as \"economic gain\" and \"performance improved\". The main point of organizational communication is that it can help an employee fulfill their work duties. Women are not able to fulfill these duties using language more relevant to them, so in order to attain success in their workplace, they have to go beyond their natural realm and utilize \"male-preferential\" language.\n\nOne of the ways that women are differentiated can be observed when we take the \"performance appraisals\" into consideration. What they mainly consist of is reviews that are based on the standards that are more like \"masculine\" standards. Research points to muted groups having little to no sense of agency, dominant emotions, and can point to the employee’s role in the silencing.\n\nOne member of the subordinate group that is also silenced in the workplace are women who face sexual harassment by the dominant group. Many women have a hard time when faced with harassment in a male dominated workplace because they are \"the verbal minority\". Organizations rarely encourage issues of sexual harassment be discussed openly and call for confidentiality when dealing with complaints. Furthermore, women rarely go through formal channels of reporting sexual harassment for a number of reasons to include: \"expecting their compliant to be ignored or trivialized by the male dominant group, fear of not being protected from retaliation, worry that the male dominated hierarchy will 'team up' against them, or that their time will be wasted due to the organizations ineffective sexual harassment policy.\" Those from the subordinate groups are trusted less than white men in the workplace and in general.\n\nThe classroom can be a place where women are muted. Women's education in the United States has progressed over the years, but academia is still male-dominated. Kramarae has raised several suggestions for more inclusive educational environments, such as including \"women's humor\", \"speechlessness\", and ways to address the issue of \"abusive language\". Including more diverse language systems in academia can keep it from being dominated by one way of thinking.\n\nIn the classroom, men and women utilize language differently. The bond differently with other members of their gender. Women tend to bond with each other through the process of discussing their problems, while men bond with each other using \"playful insults\" and \"put downs\". In the event of classroom discussions, men tend to believe that they are supposed to dominate the class discussion while women avoid dominating the discussions.\n\nHouston believes in order to create a positive reform in education it might be useful to revise the curriculum and lay special stress on \"woman-centered communication\" education. Women's Studies (WS) has evolved and grown over the years. Today there is greater demand for faculty to be on initiatives such as WS programs, African American Programs, and other programs focused on marginalized groups.\n\nIndependent parties have emerged since World War II to offer people alternative choices for election. However, most of these parties operate only in \"circumscribed regions or with very narrow platforms\". Prentice studied the impact of the third party, i.e., candidates from non-major parties, in public debate. He finds out that there have been few studies around third party by 2003 and even though third party candidates are involved in public campaign debates, they remain inarticulate and ignored due to the judgment by \"standard of the political rhetoric and worldview of the major parties\".\n\nPrentice points out that major parties usually interfere with the free expression of third parties through three ways: \"ignoring their claims, appearing confused (verbally or nonverbally) by the claims, or actively attacking the claims made\". He also notices that the debate questions are structured in a way that reflects major parties' worldviews, which results in third party's mutedness. In order to participate and articulate their own worldview, third party candidates have to transform their ideas to match the major parties' models through emphasizing the agreements with the majority rather than the differences and sometimes may lead them to make statements that can be misinterpreted.\n\nLGBT groups are considered marginalized and muted in our society. The dominant groups who \"hold privileged positions within society\" have developed social norms that marginalize LGBT groups. Although LGBT individuals do not necessarily share the same identity, they share similar experiences of being marginalized by the dominant groups. As Gross notes, \"For many oppressed groups the experience of commonality is largely the commonality of their difference from, and oppression by, the dominant culture\". In order to function and achieve success within the dominant culture, LGBT groups must adopt certain communication strategies to match the social norms.\n\nGloria Ladson-Billings believes that \"stories provide the necessary context for understanding, feeling, and interpreting\" and argues that voices of dispossessed and marginalized groups such as people of color are muted within the dominant culture. Critical race theorists try to bring the marginalized group's viewpoint to the forefront through an encouragement of \"naming one's own reality\". Delgado addresses three reasons for \"naming one's own reality\" in legal discourse: \"1) much of 'reality' is socially constructed; 2) stories provide members of outgroups a vehicle for psychic self-preservation; and 3) the exchange of stories from teller to listener can help overcome ethnocentrism and the dysconscious drive or need to view the world in one way\".\n\nWhen it comes to education, critical race theorists argue that the official school curriculum is designed to maintain a \"White supremacist master script\". As Swartz contends, master scripting sets the standard knowledge for students, which legitimizes \"dominant, white, upper-class, male voices\" and mutes multiple perspectives. The voices from other non-dominant groups are under control, mastered and can only be heard through reshaping and translation to meet the dominant standard. Therefore, Lasdon-Billing argues that the curriculum should be race-neutral or colorblind, present people of color, and \"presume a homogenized 'we' in a celebration of diversity\".\n\nAgeism leads to certain age groups being muted in American society. In particular, the elderly are often ignored and marginalized.\n\nIn \"Muted lives: Older battered women\", Carol Seaver discusses how older abused women are silenced because of sexism and ageism. She focuses on issues specific to elderly abused women, not just abused women in general. She argues that this group of domestic abuse survivors faces a specific set of difficulties, \"They are silenced by ageist assumptions about them as too resistant and hopeless to change or made invisible by the notion that very frail elders are the only victims of elder abuse.\" Here, age intersects with gender to create a specific kind of muted group. In \"Muted groups in health communication policy and practice: The case of older adults in rural and frontier areas\", Deborah Ballard-Reisch examines how and why elderly populations in the rural areas of Nevada and Kansas are considered muted health communication groups. Ageism, as well as other factors, result in this community being muted.\n\nAging populations, as seen in Seaver and Ballard-Reisch's works, can be silenced by stereotypes, such as the idea that the elderly are resistant to change.\n\nIssues of ageism intersect with heterosexism when looking at how aging LGBT community members are silenced. Scholar Maria T. Brown writes, \"The exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) elders from queer and gerontological theories has resulted in the silencing of LGBT older adults and their experiences.\" Brown claims that the silencing is a \"rhetorical move\" that excludes the elderly from queer theory and queerness from the field gerontology. This case study is an example of how identities intersect (in this case, being elderly and part of the LGBT community). MGT can apply to both of these identities and intersections.\n\nMarcel Calvez argues that, \"What makes a social group muted is that claims of its members to participate into social life are discounted and that they have internalised the idea that they are not entitled to raise their voice.\" By this logic, he says that those with intellectual disabilities are muted. Calvez's study examines the experiences of those with intellectual disabilities, with special attention to the fact these groups are often marginalized and silenced.\n\nMany disabled groups are silenced by the dominant abled group that knowingly or unknowingly exclude them. The means of muting, ridicule, ritual, control, and harassment can all apply to disabled groups. Ableist language, such as use of the pejorative term \"retard\", can be used to ridicule disabled groups. By bringing attention to the use of pejoratives and how they affect certain communities, disabled individuals and abled allies can raise awareness about their harm.\n\nTo get their concerns recognized by the dominant group, the subordinate groups take on language and communication styles of the dominant group. There are particularly stringent demands on the performances by members of \"inferior\" groups when they communicate with persons from the dominant group. Orbe (1994) identified six themes central to African American male communication: \"(1) the importance of other African Americans, (2) learning how to communicate with non-African Americans, (3) keeping a safe distance, (4) playing the part (snap!), (5) testing the sincerity of non-African Americans, and (6) an intense social responsibility.\" Respondents in Orbe’s research were observed changing immediately into two different people, in order to play the part, when communicating with non-African Americans.  \n\nIn addition to African American men feeling as though they need to communicate differently with White men, African American women also feel pressure to conform to the dominant language. A speaker’s dialect (e.g. Black English or Mainstream American English) is most heavily influenced by his or her place in the social hierarchy, for example, the speaker’s socio-economic status, educational status, provenance, and/or racial/ethnic origin. As a result, African American women find themselves needing to “code-switch” when communicating with the dominant group.\n\nMGT offers ways to change the muting status quo, i.e., naming the strategies of silencing, reclaiming, elevating and celebrating women's discourse, and creating new languages based on the experience of the marginalized group.\n\nWomen as a muted group recognize the ways in which women are silenced both interpersonally and societally, but also stress the ways that they resist being silenced such as labeling and talking about problems that are usually ignored in the dominant discourse (Vonnegut 1992). Specifically, with the creation of the Feminist Theory to understand the nature of gender inequality. Additionally, in the last year, the international movement against sexual harassment and assault with the Me Too Movement are other examples of strategies of resistance against the dominant group.\n\nAlthough the muted group theory has been mainly developed as a feminist theory, it can also be applied to other silenced groups in society. Mark Orbe, a communication theorist, has suggested that in the U.S. the dominant group consists of white, heterosexual, middle-class, males. Thus, groups that distinguish themselves from the dominant one in terms of race, age, gender, sexual orientation, and economic status can potentially be silenced or muted.\n\nIn \"African-American communication research: Toward a deeper understanding of interethnic communication\" (1995) and \"Constructing co-cultural theory: An explication of culture, power, and communication\" (1998), Orbe fleshed out two important extensions of muted group theory:\n\nTherefore, although Kramarae focuses on women's muted voices, she also opens the door to the application of muted group theory to issues beyond gender differences. Orbe not only applies this theoretical framework to a different muted group, i.e. African-Americans, but also contributes by assessing \"how individual and small collectives work together to negotiate their muted group status.\"\n\nOrbe regards \"interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members\" as co-cultural communication. He argues that there are three preferred outcomes in the co-cultural communication process: \"assimilation (e.g., becoming integrated into mainstream culture), accommodation (gaining acceptance and space in a society and achieving cultural pluralism without hierarchy), or separation (maintaining a culturally distinct identity in intercultural interactions.\" He also notes three communication approaches: \"nonassertive (when individuals are constrained and nonconfrontational, putting the needs of others first to avoid conflicts), assertive (when individuals express feelings, ideas, and rights in ways that consider the needs of themselves and others), or aggressive (when individuals express feelings, ideas, and rights in ways that ignore the needs of others).\" The different combinations of the three preferred outcomes and three communication approaches result in nine communication orientations.\n\nFurther, although various groups can be considered as muted within society, silenced and dominant groups can also exist within any group. For example, Anita Taylor and M. J. Hardman posit that feminist movements can also present dominant subgroups that mute other groups within the same movement. Thus, members within oppressed groups can have diverse opinions and one can become dominant and further mute the others.\n\nEdwin Ardener saw that MGT had pragmatic as well as analytical potentials. Edwin Ardener always maintained that MGT was not only, or even primarily, about women - although women comprised a conspicuous case in point. In fact, he also drew on his personal experience as a sensitive (intellectual) boy among hearty (sportive) boys in an all boys London secondary school. As a result of his early encounters with other boys, he identified with other groups in society for whom self-expression was constrained.\n\nMGT has often been challenged. Deborah Tannen, the theorist that created Genderlect Theory, criticizes feminist scholars like Kramarae for assuming that men are trying to control women. Tannen acknowledges that differences in male and female communication styles sometimes lead to imbalances of power, but unlike Kramarae, she is willing to assume that the problems are caused primarily by men and women's different styles. Tannen warns readers that \"bad feelings and imputation of bad motives or bad character can come about when there was no intention to dominate, to wield power\". Kramerae thinks Tannen's opinion is naïve. She believes men belittle and ignore women whenever they speak out against being muted. She also pointed out that \"our political, educational, religious, legal, and media systems support gender, race, and class hierarchies\". Both theorists believe muting is involved, but they see it from different standpoints.\n\nThere are many theories that appear to be related to Muted Group Theory. These include but are not limited to:\n\n", "id": "7710512", "categories": ["Feminist theory", "Social inequality", "Communication theory", "Cultural studies", "Sociolinguistics", "1975 introductions", "Linguistic rights", "Cultural anthropology"], "title": "Muted group theory"}

This chair is often associated with groups of women sitting and conversing. Due to fashions of the time and the lack of heating systems in homes, women wore several layers of skirts and petticoats to keep warm. This often prevented them from fitting comfortably into armchairs with rectangular seats. A caquetoire seat is splayed so women in their large skirts could easily sit.\n\nThese chairs were often made from walnut rather than oak allowing the frames to be more elaborately carved. They were built with mortise and tenon joinery, so no nails were exposed and no glue had to be used. The supports were baluster-turned and terminated in bun feet.\n\nThe name caquetoire is derived from “caqueter”, a French term meaning “to chat”. The chair was thus named the caquetoire as a reference to women sitting and talking.\n\n", "id": "7710542", "categories": [], "title": "Caquetoire"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710569", "text": "Culture of Montreal\n\nMontreal was referred to as \"\"Canada's Cultural Capital\"\" by Monocle Magazine. The city is Canada's centre for French-language television productions, radio, theatre, film, multimedia and print publishing. The \"Quartier Latin\" is a neighbourhood crowded with cafés animated by this literary and musical activity. Montreal's many cultural communities have given it a distinct local culture.\n\nAs a North American city, Montreal shares many of the cultural features characteristic of the other metropolis on the continent, including representations in all traditional manifestation of high culture, a long-lasting tradition of jazz and rock music, and tentative experimentation in visual arts, theatre, music, and dance. Yet, being at the confluence of the French and the English traditions, Montreal has developed a unique and distinguished cultural face in the world. Another distinctive characteristic of Montreal culture life is to be found in the animation of its downtown, particularly during summer, prompted by cultural and social events, or festivals.\n\nA cultural heart of classical art and the venue for many summer festivals, the Place des Arts is a complex of different concert and theatre halls surrounding a large open-spaced square in the downtown. Culture lovers will find six concert and theatre halls, five of them inside: Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, Théâtre Maisonneuve, Théâtre Jean-Duceppe, Cinquième Salle, Studio-Théâtre and one outside site: l'Esplanade. Classical dances, operas, plays, and music performance from troops around the world and from Montreal's very own are scheduled in these halls on a daily basis. The Musée d'art contemporain is located across the Esplanade from Place des Arts, and some of the most important theatre troupes and musical concert scenes are found nearby in what is now called the Quartier des Spectacles.\n\nPerforming at Place des Arts is the city's chief ballet company Les Grands Ballets Canadiens. In contemporary dance, Montreal has been a leader, particularly since the 1980s. Internationally recognized avant-garde dance troupes such as La La La Human Steps, O Vertigo, and the Fondation Jean-Pierre Perreault have toured the world and worked with international popular artists during videos and concerts. The intelligent and seamless integration of multi-disciplinary arts into the choreography of these troupes helped pave the way for the popularity of the Cirque du Soleil, a multimillion-dollar empire based on a mixture of modern circus and performing acts. The agora de la danse is a studio where contemporary dancers most often perform.\n\nThe Place des Arts also harbors the headquarters of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (MSO) that perform in its halls regularly. The MSO is one of the top performance troupes in North America, most remembered for the quality performance of the repertoire of Maurice Ravel. Since 2006, the MSO has a new conductor, the American Kent Nagano. \nTwo other popular Montreal orchestras that perform regularly at Places des Arts are the Orchestre Métropolitain conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin and I Musici de Montréal, a chamber orchestra founded by Yuli Turovsky and since 2011 conducted by Jean-Marie Zeitouni. I Musici de Montréal are considered among the greatest interpreters of the works of George Frideric Handel. Place des Arts is also the home of the Opéra de Montréal, the most prestigious opera company in Montreal. One Montreal radio station is entirely devoted to classical music.\n\nGiven that Montreal is mostly French-speaking, most popular local bands and singers have sung in French. In the past, the most popular local artists succeeded in filling arenas (Beau Dommage, Offenbach, Cowboys Fringants) or even the Olympic Stadium (e.g. Diane Dufresne), a feat usually reserved to a few international rock stars. Special events, such as the musical show on the Quebec national holiday, regularly attract over one hundred thousand people. The height for the French musical scene is reached every year during the Francofolies. The festival attracts international artists from La Francophonie, popular artists from the Quebec musical scene, and emerging artists noticed during preceding festivals.\n\nMontreal's English-speaking music scene also succeeds in getting attention from popular media around the world. The growing success of the current variety of artists and bands, with Arcade Fire arguably leading the way, owes much to the city's culture of melting together different genres of music present from many different cultures. A variety of music festivals and independent local record labels also helps sustain this success. Other Montreal bands include Wolf Parade, Mobile, the Unicorns, and Simple Plan.\n\nThe Montreal International Jazz Festival illustrates well this melting of genres. Far from limiting itself to classical jazz (a style that Montreal always represented with jazzmen such as Oscar Peterson and Oliver Jones), it features a great variety of artists who have espoused rhythms and styles from around the world. Smaller musical festivals include Festival International Nuits Afrique (\"African Nights\"), Montreal Reggae Festival, Pop Montreal, FestiBlues international de Montréal, Mutek electronic music festival, and Osheaga rock festival.\n\nEvery Sunday in Parc Mont-Royal near-downtown Montreal, there is a huge impromptu drumming festival in which hundreds of drummers are invited to jam. Tam Tams.\n\nTheatre in Montreal is dominated by French-language productions, in part because Montreal has traditionally been a centre for most successful Quebec plays. As a result, the most celebrated and internationally recognized Quebec playwrights have all worked in Montreal at some point, including Michel Tremblay (\"Les Belles Soeurs\", \"Hosanna\"), who revolutionized Quebec theatre by writing in the local dialect, joual, and Montreal-adoptee Wajdi Mouawad (\"Wedding Day at the Cromagnons\", \"Scorched\"). Most established French-language theatres are found in the Quartier Latin (e.g. Théâtre du Rideau Vert) or near Place des Arts (Théâtre du Nouveau Monde, Théâtre Jean-Duceppe). The city also hosts the Festival TransAmériques, a two-week showcase of international experimental theatre.\n\nIn contrast, English theatre struggled but survived with the Centaur Theatre. In 1979, David Fennario achieved notable success and notoriety with Canada's first bilingual play, \"Balconville,\" which documents rivalries between the English and French working class in the suburb of Pointe-St-Charles. Ethnic theatre, by the 70s, began to be a force, notably with the Black Theatre Workshop under the leadership of artistic director Tyrone Benskin, the Yiddish Theatre established at the Saidye Bronfman Centre and later with the Teesri Duniya and Dummies Theatre. In late 1990s, Montreal started to become a hotspot for low-budget independent English theatre with companies such as Optative Theatrical Laboratories, Infinithéâtre, MainLine Theatre, Gravy Bath Theatre, Sa Booge, Persephone, Pumpkin Productions, and Tableau D'Hôte Theatre adding to the scene. More recently theatre has been taking a more activist turn with emerging organizations such as ATSA and the Optative Theatrical Laboratories, and festivals such as the Anarchist Theatre Festival, MAYWORKS, and the Infringement Festival.\n\nMontréal has a rich, yet still relatively young literary history in both French and English literature. A large number of novels have captured the realities of Montreal. While any list will understandably be subjective, a few works are agreed to be important in Canadian and Québécois literature. Written in 1947, Gabrielle Roy's \"The Tin Flute\" (in French \"Bonheur d'occasion\"), which chronicles the life of a young woman in the neighborhood of St-Henri, marked Québécois literature for its urban texture. The work of Mordecai Richler, highlighted by \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\" (1959), depicts the lives of poor English-speaking residents of Mile End. Mostly Michel Tremblay perhaps best summarizes the alienation of poor working-class Montréalais at the onset of the Quebec Quiet revolution. The all-time best-selling novel in Québécois literature, Yves Beauchemin's \"The Alley Cat\" (\"Le Matou\"), depicts a relatively similar neighborhood twenty years later. The later work of Émile Ollivier, for example \"La Brûlerie\", is a portrait of French-speaking immigrants establishing their lives in the Côte-des-Neiges neighborhood.\nThe nineteenth-century poet Émile Nelligan, whom American critic Edmund Wilson famously called \"the only first-rate Canadian poet, French or English,\" has many schools and libraries named in his honour in Montreal and around Quebec. \nMontreal was also the centre of literary modernism in English Canada, led by the Montreal Group of poets including A.M. Klein and F. R. Scott in the mid-1920s. \nMontreal hosts a number of events related to literature, including the multilingual Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival, which takes place every Spring and the Expozine alternative press fair every fall.\n\nThere are plenty of English-language screens in the city, mostly downtown. The largest and most modern are the central Paramount Montreal and the AMC Forum, both located on Ste-Catherine Street. In addition to presenting movies from the majors, the AMC Forum also presents independent movies of repertory cinema. Other cinemas concentrating on repertory movies include the Cinéma du Parc.\n\nCineastes have on occasion chosen Montreal for their movies. See Montreal in films.\n\nMontreal has a vast network of museums, art galleries and exhibition centres. The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts possess a varied collection of European, First Nations, Inuit, and Canadian arts, including important paintings from Montreal's own Betty Goodwin, James Wilson Morrice and Paul-Émile Borduas. The Musée d'art contemporain has concentrated its collection mainly to emerging post-war Quebec artists, with arguably some of the best artistic works in Quebec from Alfred Pellan and Jean-Paul Riopelle.\n\nOther praised museums are the Redpath Museum, the Stewart Museum, the McCord Museum of Canadian History, the Canadian Centre for Architecture, and the Montreal Museum of Archeology and History.\n\nThe region is also home to a number of science-related museums. Many of them are located in the Olympic Park complex, including the Montreal Biodome (which reproduces four ecosystems of The Americas), the Montreal Insectarium, the Montreal Botanical Garden and the Montreal Planetarium. On the West Island, the Ecomuseum draws many visitors, and features an outdoor setting complete with animals native to the area. A recent addition to Montreal's museum scene is the Montreal Science Centre located in the Old Port, and featuring many hands-on experiments in various fields of science. The Laval Cosmodome houses both Space Camp Canada and the Space Science Centre. A short drive south in Granby, is the Granby Zoo, notable for its wide variety of animals and amusements.\n\nMontreal is the cultural centre of Québec, French-speaking Canada and French-speaking North America as a whole, and an important city in the Francophonie. It is the largest French-speaking city in North America, and the cultural capital of the Quebec province. The city is a hub for French-language television productions, radio, theatre, circuses, performing arts, film, multimedia and print publishing. The best talents from French Canada and even the French-speaking areas of the United States converge in Montreal and often perceive the city as their cultural capital. Montreal is also the most important stop in the Americas for Francophone artists from Europe, Africa and Asia.\n\nSome 30 years after the adoption of the Charter of the French Language, a greater number of first- or second-generation immigrants have established themselves in Montreal, such as playwright Wajdi Mouawad (Lebanese origin), singer Nicolas Ciccone (Italian origin), and author Dany Laferrière (Haitian origin), who all contribute to Quebec's culture.\n\nMontreal is also the cultural capital for English Quebec. The Montreal Gazette newspaper, McGill University, and the Centaur Theatre are traditional hubs of Anglo culture. The cultural divide between Montreal's and Canada's Francophone and Anglophone culture was strong and was famously referred to as the Two Solitudes by Canadian writer Hugh MacLennan. Reflecting their deep-seated colonial roots, the Solitudes were historically strongly entrenched in Montreal, splitting the city geographically at Saint Laurent Boulevard. This split, however, has become less and less apparent in the past decades. Although Anglophones still concentrate in the Montreal boroughs on the west side of the island, they have become more bilingual, as 66% of Quebec Anglophones claim to be able to carry on a conversation in French. Thus, while tensions can occur between Anglophones and Francophones, contemporary Montreal is home to a diverse collection of cultures and people who generally live together amicably.\n\nOther cultural communities, be it first-generation immigrants or long-time settlers in Montreal, have greatly contributed to the originality and flavor of Montreal. Many festivals and parades are organized to celebrate the contribution of these communities, such as the Irish Saint Patrick Parade, the Greek Independence Day Parade or the Festival des Nuits d'Afrique. Montreal's Jewish community has been a leading contributor to Montreal's cultural landscape and is renowned for its level of charitable giving and its plethora of cultural and social service community institutions. Among these are the world-renowned Jewish Public Library of Montreal, Segal Centre for the Arts, Museum of Jewish Montreal and Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre.\n\nNicknamed \"\" (\"the city of a hundred belltowers\"), Montreal is renowned for its churches. Indeed, as Mark Twain once noted, \"This is the first time I was ever in a city where you couldn't throw a brick without breaking a church window.\" The city has four Roman Catholic basilicas: Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, the aforementioned Notre-Dame Basilica, St. Patrick's Basilica, and Saint Joseph's Oratory.\nThe Oratory is the largest church in Canada, with the largest dome of its kind in the world after that of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\nOther well-known churches include Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel, which is sometimes called the Sailors' Church, and the Anglican Christ Church Cathedral, which was completely excavated and suspended above an excavated pit during the construction of part of the Underground City. All of the above are major tourist destinations, particularly Notre-Dame and the Oratory.\n\nThe dominant religion in Quebec is Christianity, which is adhered to by roughly 90.2% of the population.\n\nMontreal is the seat of a diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church.\n\nOf note is the regional variation, the Montreal hot dog. But Montreal's culinary landscape is perhaps most influenced by the diverse fabric of its ethnic communities. Italian, Greek, Jewish, and Lebanese communities have contributed to the mix of Montreal's restaurants. Jewish contributions include two world-renowned items, Montreal smoked meat sandwiches and Montreal style bagels. Lebanese falafels and shish taouk sandwiches, and Japanese sushi, have become much-appreciated cuisines.\n\nThis wide variety of cuisines underlines the fact that Montreal is one of the cities in the world with the highest number of restaurants. Montreal and its culinary landscape was the focus of Gourmet magazine's March 2006 issue. Montreal's unique cuisine has also given birth to a number of Montreal-centric restaurants and restaurant chains, such as Dagwoods, Dic Ann's Hamburgers, Dunn's Famous, Moishes Steakhouse and Lafleur Restaurants.\n\nTourism is an important industry in Montreal. The city welcomed 14 million visitors in 2005. Like the province of Quebec, visitors to Montreal come from around the world, most of them from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Mexico and Japan. 39,000 jobs in Montreal were generated by the tourism industry in 2005.\n\nCrescent Street in Downtown Montreal is popular among tourists. Throughout the summer, it features various street fairs and festivals. Among locals, Crescent Street is known better for its many clubs and bars. Saint-Laurent Boulevard and the surrounding Plateau Mont-Royal neighbourhood are also well known for their restaurants, bars, nightlife and nightclubs.\n\nThe plaza on Place des Arts is the home of the most important events during several musical festivals, including the Montreal International Jazz Festival and Montreal Francofolies, a festival of French-language music. two festivals last seven-to-ten days. performances are presented indifferent places, from relatively small clubs to the large halls of Place des Arts. Some of the outdoor shows are held on cordoned-off streets while others are in terraced parks.\n\nThe city's most popular festival, in terms of attendance, is the Just For Laughs Festival, held annually in July, is also the world's largest comedy festival. The Montreal Fireworks Festival also attracts a lot of attention. On the evenings of competition, tens of thousands of people watch the fireworks for free on their roofs or from locations nearby the competition. Other festivals in Montreal include Pop Montreal, The Fringe Festival, la Fête des Neiges de Montréal, and Nujaz. Annual family-oriented events promoting health and cycling are also organized in the streets of Montreal. Parades are also popular in downtown Montreal.\n\nMontreal is also famous as the birthplace of the Infringement Festival, a reaction to the perceived corporatization of the Montreal Fringe Festival. The Infringement has since spread to many other cities in North America and Europe.\n\nDuring the period of Prohibition in the United States, Montreal became well known as one of North America's \"sin cities\" with unparalleled nightlife, a reputation it still holds today. In part, its bustling nightlife is attributed to its relatively late \"last call\" (3 a.m.), a large university population, the drinking age of 18, and the excellent public transportation system combines with other aspects of the Montreal culture to make the city's night life unique. The diversity of the clubs in Montreal attests to the popularity of its night life, with night clubs, pubs, bars and singing bars (\"boîte à chanson\"), Latin clubs, African clubs, jazz clubs, lounges, after-hours houses, and strip clubs all attracting different types of customers.\n\nThe most active parts during Montreal night life are the Downtown and the Quartier Latin. Saint-Denis street, which goes across the Quartier Latin, attracts a majority of the French-speaking population. Saint-Laurent Street (known locally as \"the Main\") is also one of the most popular streets. A majority of English-speaking Montrealers frequent the western part of the Downtown, with Crescent Street being one of the most popular streets in this sector. These three streets are all crossed by Downtown's most commercial street, Sainte-Catherine Street, which extends to its East in the heart of Montreal gay night life.\n\n", "id": "7710569", "categories": ["Culture of Montreal"], "title": "Culture of Montreal"}

He had served as a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers Voluntary Regiment. He had been the District Valuer for Newcastle upon Tyne from 1916–1918, so knew the town well. The seat was a newly created constituency and his prospects of winning were helped when no Unionist opponent came forward and he was endorsed by the Coalition Government led by David Lloyd George; \n\nDespite being elected as a supporter of the government, Barnes resigned the Coalition Liberal Whip in November 1919 to take the opposition Liberal Whip. In parliament Barnes was associated with the more radical wing of the Liberals, due to his support for a number of social reforms. In particular he favoured the introduction of a Capital levy which in 1919 put him at odds with the caretaker Liberal Leader Sir Donald Maclean. Radical Liberals had proposed a Commons motion to introduce a capital levy which MacLean had failed to support. Barnes publicly criticised MacLean at that year's National Liberal Federation conference.\n\nHe was strong supporter of Free Trade and served as Honorary secretary of the Cobden Club from 1920–1924. At the 1922 election he sought re-election again as the official Liberal candidate. Although he did not have a Unionist opponent, he found he was also opposed by a National Liberal supporter of the recently deposed Prime Minister, Lloyd George. This had the effect of splitting the Liberal vote with unfortunate consequences;\n\nIn December 1922 his successful Labour opponent died causing a by-election. He was again selected as the Liberal candidate. By then relations between Lloyd George and Asquith were improving and he faced no National Liberal candidate. However, a Unionist candidate intervened in the by-election with the same effect;\n\nHe decided to try his luck elsewhere and stood in Tynemouth at the 1923 general election. Tynemouth had been a Unionist seat since they gained it from the Liberals in 1918. He did well, but not quite well enough; \n\nHe contested Tynemouth again at the 1924 election, but in a difficult year for the Liberal Party his return to parliament was again thwarted;\n\nHe was also involved in local government politics in London. He served as an Alderman on the London County Council from 1923–1925, for the Liberal backed Progressive Party.\n\nIn September 1927 Barnes was selected as Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate for the Unionist seat of Warwick and Leamington. However, he was not called upon to contest the seat at an election. In 1928, Barnes instead contested a July by-election in the West Yorkshire seat of Halifax, following the resignation of the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Henry Whitley, who had represented the seat as Liberal since 1900. This seemed to represent his best chance of returning to parliament but he was to be disappointed;\n\nHe did not stand for Parliament again.\n\nAt the 1934 LCC Elections he stood as a Labour candidate at Fulham East and was elected. He served as Chairman of the LCC's Town Planning Committee. However, he served on the LCC for little more than a year before his death.\n\nHe had published a number of publications on social matters;\n\n", "id": "7710634", "categories": ["1935 deaths", "UK MPs 1918–22", "Labour Party (UK) politicians", "Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies", "1870 births"], "title": "Harry Barnes (Liberal politician)"}
