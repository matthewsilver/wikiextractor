It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as Rockwell.\n\nThe face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. Balls were added to the upper terminals on letters such as \"C\" and \"G\" to increase its charm. Italics are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many Hoefler & Frere-Jones designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.\n\nThe typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for Wells Fargo and is a main font for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and Wes Anderson's film \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\".

The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over Germany, Austria-Hungary and Scandinavia during the \"Belle Époque\" era.\n\nSwiss chalet style originated in the Romantic era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the English landscape garden inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the \"simple life\" of people living in the mountains. \n\nThe chalet style soon spread over the German \"Mittelgebirge\" landscapes such as the Harz mountains or the Dresden area and the adjacent North Bohemian region. As a \"modern\" building style, it also influenced the resort architecture along the Baltic seaside, like in Binz or Heringsdorf. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like Heinrich von Ferstel to build larger mansions and hotels. \n\nThe style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the architecture of Norway, Iceland and the Netherlands and in the country house architecture of Sweden and Cincinnati (Ohio, USA), in the late 19th and early 20th century.

He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.\n\nAlong with Nick Gage, Justice Pain, and Ric Blade, Lobo was trained by John Zandig at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class. He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second Iron Man Champion. He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain. These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first \"Cage of Death\" show. Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to Wifebeater, but regain it one more time the following year.\n\nLobo also challenged for the CZW Heavyweight Championship.

Often a variant of anti-ship missile designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a jet or rocket engine, to deliver: an explosive warhead aimed directly at a submarine; a depth charge, or; a homing torpedo that is carried from a launch ship, or other platform, to the vicinity of a target.\n\nDepth charges were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged submarines. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard sonar was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range.\n\nVarious mortar-type projectors, including Hedgehog and Squid, were devised during World War II to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.\n\nDuring the Cold War, missiles were developed to provide greater range with reduced recoil. Some missiles and rockets, such as Hong Sang Eo carry homing torpedoes to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.\n\nThe advantage of an anti-submarine missile is the attack stand-off range. The Swedish Bofors 375mm m/50 Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) rockets, in the past commonly used by Sweden, France, Japan and Germany for instance, can travel as far as 3600m depending on the rocket used. The USSR developed its own anti-submarine rockets in the RBU series and these are still in use in Russia and in countries using Russian designed ships. Today anti-submarine rockets have been phased out in most western navies, replaced by the Homing ASW Torpedo.\n\n", "id": "7697715", "categories": ["Guided missiles", "Anti-submarine weapons", "Anti-submarine warfare", "Anti-submarine missiles", "Missile types"], "title": "Anti-submarine missile"}

This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large tides, with immature sharks ranging into fresh and brackish water. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to long.\n\nNorthern river sharks are likely piscivorous. This species is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the wet season. Very rare and facing threats from commercial and recreational fishing, and perhaps also habitat degradation, this species has been assessed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nThe first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by New Zealand ichthyologist Jack Garrick, after whom the species was eventually named. This shark was referred to as \"\"Glyphis\" sp. C\" until 2008, when it was formally described by Leonard Compagno, William White, and Peter R. Last in a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation paper. The type specimen is a female long, collected from the East Alligator River, Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory.\n\nThe northern river shark has been reported from King Sound, the Ord River, and Doctors Creek near Derby, Western Australia, the Adelaide and Alligator Rivers in Australia's Northern Territory, and the Daru region and possibly the Fly River in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large rivers, estuaries, and coastal bays, all of which are characterized by high turbidity, silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water (salinity ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.\n\nLike other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with nictitating membranes. Each nostril is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30–35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.\n\nThe pectoral fins are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The pelvic fins are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first dorsal fin is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The caudal fin has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is . This species differs from the speartooth shark (\"G. glyphis\") in several morphological and meristic characters, including having fewer vertebrae (137–151 versus 213–222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.\n\nWith its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of ampullae of Lorenzini, the northern river shark seems to be adapted for hunting fish in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide. Like other requiem sharks, this species is viviparous, with the developing embryos forming a placental connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of yolk. Females give birth around October, before the start of the wet season, on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine fetuses. The young are born at under long; males mature between lengths of , while females mature between lengths of .\n\nThe northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation. This species is caught legally and illegally by commercial fisheries using longlines and gillnets, as well as by recreational fishers; habitat degradation may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the IUCN has assessed the northern river shark as critically endangered. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species. No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.\n", "id": "7697725", "categories": ["Glyphis", "Fauna of the Northern Territory", "Critically endangered fish", "Freshwater fish of New Guinea", "Critically endangered fauna of Oceania", "Fish of Papua New Guinea", "Freshwater fish of Australia", "Brackish water organisms", "Freshwater fish of Oceania", "Critically endangered fauna of Australia"], "title": "Northern river shark"}

Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational chapel shared by Catholic, Protestant and Jewish congregations.\n\nThe building design is a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 700-series U.S. Army chapel. It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a steepled bell tower and a gable entry porch. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.\n\nThe U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the \"townsite\" area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included prayers and talks by a Jewish rabbi, a Catholic priest, an Episcopal priest, a Baptist minister, and the minister who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel. Its name, \"The Chapel on the Hill,\" comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.\n\nThe United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main cafeteria. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by laypersons, to include all denominations. A Presbyterian minister working in Knoxville was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of \"the United Church\". Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.\n\nWhen the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the Manhattan Project community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, weddings, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.\n\nAt the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as Sunday school classes in several local schools and a trailer camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single interdenominational congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.\n\nThe United Church congregation purchased the chapel and of land from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116. An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957. The facility continues to operate as a nondenominational Protestant church under lay leadership, employing ministers with backgrounds in mainstream Protestant denominations. Since 2007 it has been affiliated with the Center for Progressive Christianity. The church's motto is \"Where People from All Denominations Meet in Their Differences, but Are One in Their Search for God.\"\n\nThe Chapel-on-the-Hill was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 as a contributing property in the Oak Ridge Historic District.\n\n", "id": "7697757", "categories": ["Nondenominational Christian churches in Tennessee", "Churches in Tennessee", "Wooden churches in Tennessee", "Military chapels of the United States", "Oak Ridge, Tennessee", "Buildings and structures in Anderson County, Tennessee", "Historic district contributing properties in Tennessee", "Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee"], "title": "United Church, The Chapel on the Hill"}

The goals of the open-source data movement are similar to those of other \"open(-source)\" movements such as open-source software, hardware, open content, open education, open educational resources, open government, open knowledge, open access, open science, and the open web. Paradoxically, the growth of the open data movement is paralleled by a rise in intellectual property rights. The philosophy behind open data has been long established (for example in the Mertonian tradition of science), but the term \"open data\" itself is recent, gaining popularity with the rise of the Internet and World Wide Web and, especially, with the launch of open-data government initiatives such as Data.gov, Data.gov.uk and Data.gov.in.\n\nOpen data can also be linked data; when it is, it is linked open data. One of the most important forms of open data is open government data (OGD), which is a form of open data created by ruling government institutions. Open government data's importance is borne from it being a part of citizens' everyday lives, down to the most routine/mundane tasks that are seemingly far removed from government.\n\nThe concept of open data is not new, but a formalized definition is relatively new. Conceptually, open data as a phenomenon denotes that governmental data should be available to anyone with a possibility of redistribution in any form without any copyright restriction. One more definition is the Open Definition which can be summarized in the statement that \"A piece of data is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it – subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.\" Other definitions, including the Open Data Institute's \"Open data is data that anyone can access, use or share\", have an accessible short version of the definition but refer to the formal definition.\n\nOpen data may include non-textual material such as maps, genomes, connectomes, chemical compounds, mathematical and scientific formulae, medical data, and practice, bioscience and biodiversity. Problems often arise because these are commercially valuable or can be aggregated into works of value. Access to, or re-use of, the data is controlled by organisations, both public and private. Control may be through access restrictions, licenses, copyright, patents and charges for access or re-use. Advocates of open data argue that these restrictions are against the common good and that these data should be made available without restriction or fee. In addition, it is important that the data are re-usable without requiring further permission, though the types of re-use (such as the creation of derivative works) may be controlled by a license.\n\nA typical depiction of the need for open data:\n\nCreators of data often do not consider the need to state the conditions of ownership, licensing and re-use; instead presuming that not asserting copyright puts the data into the public domain. For example, many scientists do not regard the published data arising from their work to be theirs to control and consider the act of publication in a journal to be an implicit release of data into the commons. However, the lack of a license makes it difficult to determine the status of a data set and may restrict the use of data offered in an \"Open\" spirit. Because of this uncertainty it is also possible for public or private organizations to aggregate said data, protect it with copyright and then resell it.\n\nThe issue of indigenous knowledge (IK) poses a great challenge in terms of capturing, storage and distribution. Many societies in third-world countries lack the technicality processes of managing the IK.\n\nAt his presentation at the XML 2005 conference, Connolly displayed these two quotations regarding open data:\n\nOpen data can come from any source. This section lists some of the fields that publish (or at least discuss publishing) a large amount of open data.\n\nThe concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established with the formation of the World Data Center system, in preparation for the International Geophysical Year of 1957–1958. The International Council of Scientific Unions (now the International Council for Science) oversees several World Data Centres with the mandate to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility.\n\nWhile the open-science-data movement long predates the Internet, the availability of fast, ubiquitous networking has significantly changed the context of Open science data, since publishing or obtaining data has become much less expensive and time-consuming.\n\nThe Human Genome Project was a major initiative that exemplified the power of open data. It was built upon the so-called Bermuda Principles, stipulating that: \"All human genomic sequence information (…) should be freely available and in the public domain in order to encourage research and development and to maximise its benefit to society'. More recent initiatives such as the Structural Genomics Consortium have illustrated that the open data approach can also be used productively within the context of industrial R&D.\n\nIn 2004, the Science Ministers of all nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes most developed countries of the world, signed a declaration which essentially states that all publicly funded archive data should be made publicly available. Following a request and an intense discussion with data-producing institutions in member states, the OECD published in 2007 the \"OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding\" as a \"soft-law\" recommendation.\n\nExamples of open data in science:\n\nThere are a range of different arguments for government open data. For example, some advocates contend that making government information available to the public as machine readable open data can facilitate government transparency, accountability and public participation. \"Open data can be a powerful force for public accountability—it can make existing information easier to analyze, process, and combine than ever before, allowing a new level of public scrutiny.\" Governments that enable public viewing of data can help citizens engage within the governmental sectors and \"add value to that data.\" \n\nSome make the case that opening up official information can support technological innovation and economic growth by enabling third parties to develop new kinds of digital applications and services.\n\nSeveral national governments have created websites to distribute a portion of the data they collect. It is a concept for a collaborative project in municipal Government to create and organize culture for Open Data or Open government data.\n\nAdditionally, other levels of government have established open data websites. There are many government entities pursuing Open Data in Canada. Data.gov lists the sites of a total of 40 US states and 46 US cities and counties with websites to provide open data; e.g. the state of Maryland, the state of California, US and New York City.\n\nAt the international level, the United Nations has an open data website that publishes statistical data from member states and UN agencies, and the World Bank published a range of statistical data relating to developing countries. The European Commission has created two portals for the European Union: the EU Open Data Portal which gives access to open data from the EU institutions, agencies and other bodies and the PublicData portal that provides datasets from local, regional and national public bodies across Europe.\n\nIn October 2015, the Open Government Partnership launched the International Open Data Charter, a set of principles and best practices for the release of governmental open data formally adopted by seventeen governments of countries, states and cities during the OGP Global Summit in Mexico.\n\nThe debate on open data is still evolving. The best open government applications seek to empower citizens, to help small businesses, or to create value in some other positive, constructive way. Opening government data is only a way-point on the road to improving education, improving government, and building tools to solve other real world problems. While many arguments have been made categorically, the following discussion of arguments for and against open data highlights that these arguments often depend highly on the type of data and its potential uses.\n\nArguments made on behalf of open data include the following:\n\n\nIt is generally held that factual data cannot be copyrighted. However, publishers frequently add copyright statements (often forbidding re-use) to scientific data accompanying publications. It may be unclear whether the factual data embedded in full text are part of the copyright.\n\nWhile the human abstraction of facts from paper publications is normally accepted as legal there is often an implied restriction on the machine extraction by robots.\n\nUnlike open access, where groups of publishers have stated their concerns, open data is normally challenged by individual institutions. Their arguments have been discussed less in public discourse and there are fewer quotes to rely on at this time.\n\nArguments against making all data available as open data include the following:\n\n\nThe goals of the Open Data movement are similar to those of other \"Open\" movements.\n\n\nSeveral funding bodies which mandate Open Access also mandate Open Data. A good expression of requirements (truncated in places) is given by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR):\n\n\nOther bodies active in promoting the deposition of data as well as fulltext include the Wellcome Trust. An academic paper published in 2013 advocated that Horizon 2020 (the science funding mechanism of the EU, due to launch in 2014) should mandate that funded projects hand in their databases as \"deliverables\" at the end of the project, so that they can be checked for third party usability then shared.\n\nSeveral mechanisms restrict access to or reuse of data (and several reasons for doing this are given above). They include:\n\n\n", "id": "7697770", "categories": ["Open data"], "title": "Open data"}

Born in Mogadouro, he emigrated to Niassa Province, Portuguese Mozambique during the 1950s, where he established himself as a professional hunter. Roxo later fought in the Mozambican War of Independence against nationalist guerrillas. After Mozambican independence he served as a foreign volunteer in 32 Battalion, a Portuguese-speaking unit of the South African Army.\n\nDaniel Roxo was born in Mogadouro, Trás-os-Montes, on 1 February 1933. As a young man he immigrated to Niassa Province in 1951, where he settled as a professional hunter and safari guide. When the Mozambican War of Independence broke out in 1964 Roxo formed his African trackers, servants, and European acquaintances into a private militia, hunting FRELIMO combatants for government bounties.\n\nDisillusioned by Portugal's promise to hand Mozambique to Samora Machel's incoming government, Roxo supported an abortive coup d'état by anti-FRELIMO forces in Lourenço Marques on September 7, 1974. He went into exile in South Africa the following November, joining the South African Defence Force. After completing Special Forces selection, Danny was seconded to Bravo Group (later 32 Battalion).\n\nRoxo was awarded the Honoris Crux for bravery during Operation Savannah for an action during the Battle of Bridge 14 at , an engagement during which he single-handedly killed eleven enemy soldiers.\n\nBridge 14 was situated on the Nhia River, en route from Cela to Quibala. South African mechanized contingents deploying to the south had routed a unit of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) some time prior, and the retreating Angolans had demolished the existing structure. However, since Colonel Jan Breytenbach could not ascertain this from his forward positions, he ordered Roxo to conduct a more thorough reconnaissance. Roxo arrived at the river with four Eland-90 armoured cars; his patrol came under heavy mortar fire from an opposite bank and two of the vehicles withdrew, leaving Roxo's platoon to retire on foot. Having scouted the bridge alone and determined it was no longer intact, he inadvertently walked into an FAPLA ambush, but he managed to dispatch his attackers. Two escaped South African prisoners later claimed that aside from the Angolan casualties, four Cuban troops were reported killed in the encounter.\n\nDuring a patrol near the Okavango river, his personnel carrier struck a landmine and overturned, killing one man and crushing Roxo beneath it. The rest of the vehicle's crew tried to lift it free, but it was too heavy.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7697801", "text": "Day-fine\n\nA day-fine, day fine, unit fine or structured fine is a unit of fine payment that, above a minimum fine, is based on the offender's daily personal income. A crime is punished with incarceration for a determined number of days, or with fines. As incarceration is a financial punishment, in the effect of preventing work, a day-fine represents one day incarcerated and without salary. It is argued to be just, because if both high-income and low-income population are punished with the same jail time, they should also be punished with a proportionally similar income loss. An analogy may be drawn with income tax, which is also proportional to the income, even progressively.\n\nJurisdictions employing the day-fine include Finland (), Estonia (), Sweden (), Denmark (), Germany (), France (), Switzerland, and Macao.\n\nIn Finland, the day-fine system is used for most crimes that are punishable by way of a fine. The system has been in use since 1921. Most minor infractions are punished with a fixed petty fine (\"rikesakko\", \"ordningsbot\") such as minor traffic and water traffic violations,\nlittering, and breaches of public peace.\nA petty fine is summarily ordered by the police officer if the suspect does not contest his guilt, but the person punished may contest the fine in a district court.\nMost infractions are punishable with a day-fine. For crimes warranting no more than six months in prison, the fine may be summarily ordered by the prosecutor if the suspect does not want the court to handle the case. The process of ordering a day fine is started by a police officer who makes a formal demand for the suspect to be fined. The suspect has one week to contest the demand. If the suspect does not contest the demand, the prosecutor may order a fine which may not be higher than demanded by the police officer. If the suspect contests the demand, the case may be taken to the district court if the prosecutor considers the suspect guilty. If the prosecutor considers the case to merit a term in prison or a higher fine, the case is always taken to the court. If the prosecution or the injured party do not demand a higher punishment than a fine, the district court has a quorum with a single member. The fine is paid to the bank using a giro. A fine ordered in Finland is executable in any European Union member country.\n\nA Finnish fine consists of a minimum of 1 day-fine, up to a maximum of 120 day-fines. If several crimes are punished together, 240 day-fines may be sentenced. The fines may not be sentenced together with a prison sentence, unless the prison sentence is probational. The minimum amount of a day-fine is 6 euros. Usually, the day-fine is one half of daily disposable income. The daily disposable income is considered to be one 60th part of the person's monthly mean income during the year, after taxes, social security payments and a basic living allowance of €255 per month have been deducted. In addition, every person for whose upkeep the fined person is responsible decreases the amount of daily fine by €3. The income of the person is calculated on the basis of the latest taxation data. For speeding in traffic, however, the fine is at least as high as the petty fine, i.e. €115.\n\nThe person who is punished with a fine is responsible for giving accurate information concerning their income. Lying about one's income (, ) is a crime punishable with a fine or up to three months in prison. The police can, however, access the taxation data of Finnish citizens and permanent residents via a real-time datalink, so the chance of lying successfully is minor. There is no maximum day-fine, which may lead to considerably high fines for high-income persons. For example, in 2001, a Finnish businessman with a yearly income of 10 million euros, received a relatively mild punishment of six day-fines, amounting €26,000, for driving though a red traffic light. In 2009 a businessman was fined €112,000 for travelling at 82 kilometres per hour in an area with a speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour. As speeding is punished with a petty fine if the offender is exceeding the speed limit by up to 20 km/h, but with a day-fine if exceeding the limit by 21 km/h or more, the monetary amount of the fine can increase from €115 to over €100,000 although the actual change in speed is less than 1 km/h. This has given rise to some criticism, most vividly expressed by a Finnish member of parliament, avid motorist Klaus Bremer and other MPs of right-wing parties.\n\nThe fines are subject to recovery proceedings. If the fines are still not paid, the court may convert them to a prison sentence. Three day-fines will be converted to one day of imprisonment, ignoring the remainder for any amount of day-fines not divisible by three, and the length of the sentence must be between 4 and 60 days. This \"conversion punishment\" (, ) is only ever applied to court-ordered fines, not those issued by police.\n\nDay fines are a concept to which little thought has been given in India. Undeniably, prisons are overcrowded and disproportionately represent religious minorities and socio-economically vulnerable castes and tribal groups. It is however unclear how much of this is due to fines. The IPC provides some safeguards on imposing fines such as monetary caps on fines for some offences and stringent limits for imprisonment for non-payment of fines. Where no upper monetary caps are specified, the IPC does not gives courts discretion to impose fines which are “unlimited” but not “excessive”. While specific fine amounts would require to be done away with in the text of the IPC, several underlying actions would need to be done before pressing day fines into service. \nArticle 45 of the Penal Code (, Portuguese: ) specifies that a criminal fine (, Portuguese: ) shall normally be at least 10 days and at most 360 days. One day-fine costs at least 50 Macanese patacas and at most 10,000 patacas. A court of law imposes the fine based on the economic and financial situations and personal burdens of a convict.\n\nEngland and Wales experimented with the system for a short period from 1992 to 1993. It was unpopular with both magistrates and the general public, and was soon abandoned. The scheme was replaced by requirements that magistrates consider an offender's means when imposing a fine, just not according to a mathematical formula.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported on an experiment with day fines which took place in 1988 in Staten Island, which was a partnership between the local courts and District Attorney, and the Vera Institute of Justice.\n\n\n", "id": "7697801", "categories": ["Punishments", "Finnish law", "Criminal law"], "title": "Day-fine"}

The game focuses on aerial combat between the different races of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Released in January 2007, it was developed and published by Forge World, a division of the British gaming company Games Workshop.\n\nAeronautica Imperialis is a companion game to \"Epic\", which emphasises battles between armies on a larger scale than \"Warhammer 40,000\".\n\nGameplay-wise, the major difference between \"Epic\" and \"Aeronautica Imperialis\" is that instead of a player moving and firing tanks and troops, they are using aircraft and ground defense weapons.\n\nThe \"Aeronautica Imperialis\" rulebook contains not only rules for the games, but also two sheets of cards] which are used to make special manoeuvres. Other content in the rulebook is background material on the individual aircraft, along with full colour plates and suggestions for painting. At the end of the book, there is a \"campaign\" section with scenarios for players to recreate.\n\nIt makes use of currently available aircraft models designed for \"Epic\", which are approximately 6mm scale, or 1:285. Forge World's say that \"Epic models are 5 times smaller than their Warhammer 40,000 equivalent\". In addition to the use of the miniatures, Forge World also sells special bases for the game to indicate such things as the altitude, speed, and fire arcs of each aeroplane.\n\nThe currently supported races or factions are the Imperial Navy, Space Marines, Eldar, Tau, Chaos and Orks.\n\nAeronautica Imperialis has a strong tie with the Black Library book \"Double Eagle\" by Dan Abnett. This deals with the air war occurring during the Sabbat Worlds Campaign (the setting for Abnett's \"Gaunt's Ghosts\" novel series). It has a Battle of Britain flavour; many of the concepts elucidated in the Aeronautica rules can be seen in Abnett's writing.\n\nIn late 2007, Forge World released Tactica Aeronautica, a collection of extra rules, new aircraft and scenarios for the game.\n\n", "id": "7697805", "categories": ["Warhammer 40,000 tabletop games"], "title": "Aeronautica Imperialis"}

The second was completed as \"Santa Fe\". They were purchased in 1912 by Greece, ready for delivery, each for the sum of £148,000, when the Balkan Wars seemed likely. \"Ierax\" was accepted by Captain Ath. Miaoulis, RHN in Palermo, Sicily where she arrived manned by a foreign crew.\n\nDuring the Balkan Wars, the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition, 3,000 rounds of torpedoes. Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship, and for this reason these ships were initially named 'scouts' rather than 'destroyers'. On October 21, 1912, under the command of Commander A. Vratsanos, RHN, \"Ierax\" was part of the Greek flotilla that captured the island of Psara from the Ottomans.\n\nDuring World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and, due to Greece's neutrality the four \"Aetos\"-class ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916, taken over by the French in November, and served in the French Navy from 1917-18.

Little is known about the wandering philosopher known as Altheides of Cyprus, and little of his work remains available to modern scholars. His parents were Greek merchants living on the island under the rule of Guy of Lusignan. He was born a year before Guy's death, in 1193. At some point in his late teens he left Cyprus as a seaman on a Moorish trading vessel.\n\nAltheides again turns up in historical records with the founding of his School of Philosophy in Jerusalem in 1226, under the rule of al-Kamil, the nephew of Saladin and ruler of Jerusalem. His school was never particularly successful, and dispersed shortly after al-Kamil's treaty of 1229 signing the city back over to the Crusaders. From this point very little is known. Scattered accounts and writings appear here and there in as varied locations as Spain, Morocco, Rome, and Egypt.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7698038", "text": "Radamel Falcao\n\nRadamel Falcao García Zárate (; 10 February 1986) is a Colombian professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Monaco and the Colombia national team. He is sometimes nicknamed \"\"El Tigre\"\" (Spanish for \"The Tiger\") or \"King of the Europa League\".\n\nFalcao began his professional career at the age of 13 at Lanceros Boyacá, before moving to the Argentine club River Plate, where he won the 2007–08 Clausura tournament. In 2009, he joined the Portuguese club Porto, where he won several trophies, including the Europa League and Primeira Liga double in 2011. Falcao became their all-time top goalscorer in international club competitions and set the record for most goals (17) in a European campaign. He also became the first Colombian to receive the Portuguese Golden Ball award. In August 2011, Falcao was transferred to Atlético Madrid for a club record €40 million, leading them to Europa League and Super Cup victories in 2012. Falcao finished as top goalscorer for the second straight year and became the first player to win consecutive Europa League titles with two teams. He was named in the FIFA World XI for 2012.\n\nIn May 2013, Falcao joined newly promoted Monaco for a club record €60 million; however, an ACL injury ruled him out for several months. Falcao spent the next two seasons on loan at Premier League clubs Manchester United and Chelsea, eventually rejoining Monaco in 2016 and leading them to Ligue 1 title for the 2016–17 season.\n\nFalcao made his senior debut for Colombia in 2007, and has since earned 83 caps and scored 33 goals, making him their all-time top scorer. He represented his country at the 2011 and 2015 Copa América. Falcao missed the 2014 FIFA World Cup through injury, but made his World Cup debut at the 2018 tournament in Russia.\n\nFalcao made his debut for Lanceros Boyacá in the Colombian Categoría Primera B (second tier) on 28 August 1999 at the age of 13 years and 199 days, thus becoming the youngest debutant at that level of Colombian professional football. In 2000, Lanceros' coach, Hernán Pacheco, began to consider the 14-year-old more seriously; Falcao played seven matches that year. On 25 July, at the Estadio Olímpico del Sol at Sogamoso, he scored his first and only goal for the club, to seal a 2–0 win against Club El Cóndor that took Lanceros off the bottom of the table. In his two years with the club, he played eight matches and scored once.\n\nAfter training with Millonarios, who did not take up their option to purchase the player, Falcao was sold to River Plate of Argentina in February 2001, for a $500,000 fee. He began his River career in the youth team, playing in the eighth division of Argentine football. River's coach, Leonardo Astrada, gave Falcao his professional debut in the 2005 Torneo Clausura, on 6 March 2005, in a game that the club won 3–1 to Instituto de Córdoba.\n\nFalcao became a regular in the first team during the 2005 Torneo Apertura. He scored twice in a match for the first time in Argentina, on 2 October in a game against Independiente that finished as a 3–1 win for River. He repeated the feat twice more during the Apertura: against Lanús, his brace contributed to a 4–1 home win, and against San Lorenzo, River won 5–1. This brought his total for the competition to seven from as many games under the management of Reinaldo Merlo, who gave Falcao the trust he needed to establish himself in the team.\n\nIn the match against San Lorenzo in November, Falcao injured the ligaments of his right knee and missed the remainder of the Apertura; then, during pre-season training in January 2006, he sustained more serious damage to the same knee, which required surgery and was expected to keep him out for at least six months. He returned to the field in September, soon after the start of the 2006 Torneo Apertura, in which he made 12 appearances, mainly as a substitute; he scored just once, to seal a 2–0 win against Rosario Central that took River clear at the top of the table. A few days earlier, he made his debut in CONMEBOL competition, in the last eight of the 2006 Copa Sudamericana against Atlético Paranaense of Brazil. He was replaced at half-time, and the match finished 2–2, so River were eliminated on aggregate, having lost the home leg 1–0.\n\nHe was sent off in his only outing in the 2007 Copa Libertadores, against Colo-Colo in February 2007. Domestically, he made little impression on the 2007 Torneo Clausura. He scored in only one of the eight games he played: River's first two goals as they beat Racing Club 4–2 away from home. Falcao scored his first professional hat-trick on 28 September 2007, as River made a historic comeback against Botafogo to progress in the 2007 Sudamericana. The following week, he scored his first goal in a \"Superclásico\", the first of River's goals as they beat Boca Juniors 2–0.\n\nRiver Plate were reported to have rejected a $15 million offer from Milan for Falcao in early 2008, as well as bids from clubs including Aston Villa and Fluminense. He was a key player as Diego Simeone led River to the 2008 Torneo Clausura championship, his first domestic title, and his performances meant he was linked with moves to a variety of clubs. Nevertheless, he remained with River as they suffered the worst campaign in their history, finishing bottom of the 2008 Torneo Apertura.\n\nIn 2009, River Plate had a difficult start: they were eliminated in the group stage of the Copa Libertadores 2009 and won few games at the beginning of the 2009 Torneo Clausura. Falcao retained his eye for goal and was instrumental in Nestor Gorosito's plans, having matured as a striker over the previous two years; he finished as top scorer with 43 goals.\n\nFalcao moved to Europe on 15 July 2009 to join Porto of the Portuguese Primeira Liga for a €3.93 million transfer fee for 60% of his economic rights after Porto sold striker Lisandro López to Lyon. In the transaction, Porto also sold Mario Bolatti for €1.5 million to a third party owner, Natland Financier B.V., in exchange for 35% of the economic rights of Falcao. Falcao was about to sign for Porto rivals Benfica days before, but the reluctance of its leaders to pay an additional €700,000 requested by Falcao dictated the end of negotiations; days later, Falcao joined Porto. He made his debut against Paços de Ferreira on the opening day of the season and scored an important goal to earn the team a draw. He went on to score three goals in as many games, making him one of the few to score four goals in the first four matchdays in the Portuguese league.\n\nOn 15 September, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in a 1–0 away defeat against Chelsea. Two weeks later, on 30 September, he scored his first Champions League goal in a group stage win over Atlético Madrid. On 12 December, Falcao scored a header to defeat rivals Sporting Clube de Portugal in a 1–0 home victory. On 2 February 2010, Falcao scored twice in a Taça de Portugal quarter-finals victory against rivals Sporting CP. In the same month, he scored the winning goal against Arsenal in a UEFA Champions League round of 16 match, his fourth goal in the tournament. On 3 April, Falcao scored a brace against Marítimo to lead the scoring charts with 20 goals, however he would finish the season as the second-highest league scorer with 25 goals, behind only Benfica's Óscar Cardozo, who had 26. He scored in his last game of the season, the 2009–10 Taça de Portugal, where Porto won 2–1 against Chaves. Falcao wrapped up the campaign with a career-high 34 goals in all competitions.\n\nFalcao made an impressive start to the 2010–11 season, scoring a goal in the 2010 Portuguese SuperCup 2–0 victory over Benfica. He scored his first two league goals on the second matchday of the season against Beira-Mar on 22 August 2010. On 7 November, he scored twice (one of them a backheel goal) in a 5–0 victory against the defending champions Benfica. On 2 December, Falcao scored his first hat-trick for Porto against Rapid Wien during a UEFA Europa League clash, becoming the top goal scorer with seven goals. On 7 April 2011, Falcao scored another hat-trick in the quarter-final of the Europa League against Russian side Spartak Moscow in a 5–1 victory, to bring his goal tally in the tournament to ten.\n\nIn the 2010–11 season, Porto won the league title in round 25 of the league against rivals and defending champions Benfica at the Estádio da Luz. Falcao played a key role in that match, winning his team a penalty when the match was tied at 1–1; the penalty was scored by teammate Hulk. In the match against Spartak Moscow in the Europa League, Falcao scored a hat-trick and provided an assist in a 5–1 win. In the second leg, he scored another goal and provided another assist that took Porto to the tournament's semi-final stage. He further added to his position as top scorer in the competition by scoring four goals in the semi-final first leg against Villarreal, a game which finished 5–1 in favour of Porto.\n\nIn the Europa League final against domestic rivals Braga, Falcao scored the only goal of the game with a header after a cross from Fredy Guarín, giving the title to Porto. He set a new goalscoring record of 17 goals in 14 games during the Europa League campaign, surpassing Jürgen Klinsmann's previous record of 15 goals. In July 2011, Falcao extended his contract with an added €45 million buy-out clause. Porto paid a commission of €6,585,150 to extend the contract.\n\nOn 18 August 2011, Porto announced they had agreed a fee with Atlético Madrid for the transfer of Falcao. The transfer fee was €40 million with the fee potentially rising to €50 million based on performance-based clauses, making him the most expensive player in the club's history. Falcao made his Atlético debut on 10 September away to Valencia, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 defeat. On 3 November, Falcao netted a goal in Atlético's 4–0 triumph over Udinese – the goal meant that Falcao had scored 19 goals in his last 18 Europa League games.\n\nFalcao's second hat-trick in La Liga came on 21 January 2012, when he led his team to a 4–0 victory against Real Sociedad at the Anoeta Stadium. On 16 February, Falcao scored twice and assisted a goal in an away game against Lazio to progress to the round of 16 in the Europa League. In the second leg of Atlético's Round of 16 clash against Turkish club Beşiktaş, Falcao scored one goal and provided another in a 3–0 victory, advancing 6–1 on aggregate. On 21 March, Falcao netted a second half double to propel his side to a 2–1 victory over Athletic Bilbao and keep Atlético in the race for European places. Falcao scored another goal sealing a 3–0 victory over Getafe. In both legs of the Europa League quarter-final tie versus Hannover 96, Falcao managed to score a goal for each leg, helping Atlético seal a 4–2 aggregate victory and increasing his goal tally to eight in the competition.\n\nFalcao played his first Madrid Derby against Real Madrid on 11 April 2012. He had missed the first match at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium due to injury, and scored Atlético's only goal as his side fell 4–1 due to a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick. He scored his 22nd goal of the season against Rayo Vallecano in a crucial 1–0 victory for Atlético. For the first leg of the 2011–12 Europa League semi-finals against Valencia, Falcao scored a double in a 4–2 victory while making Atlético the first team to win ten consecutive matches in a single Europa League season. Falcao added to his Europa League tally in the final against fellow Liga side Athletic Bilbao, netting Atlético's opening two goals in a 3–0 triumph at the Arena Națională in Bucharest on 9 May 2012. In so doing, Falcao not only became the top goal scorer in a Europa league season again, but became the first player in history to win two consecutive Europa League titles with two different teams.\n\nFalcao scored two hat-tricks at the start of the 2012–13 season; first in the La Liga game against 2012 Europa League finalists Athletic Bilbao, and the second in the defeat of Chelsea, winning the 2012 UEFA Super Cup 4–1 on 31 August 2012. At the same time, Falcao became the first player in history to score a hat trick in a UEFA Super Cup final in its current format; the original format was two legged before turning into a single legged final format in 1998. On 16 September, Falcao scored what turned out to be the decisive goal from the penalty spot in a 4–3 win over Rayo Vallecano, and did the same a week later against Real Valladolid, before going off at half-time in order to avoid a possible groin injury. Falcao scored a double in a 4–2 away victory over Real Betis, converting a cross for the first and then converting a penalty, putting him to the top of the goal scoring charts in La Liga with seven goals.\n\nFalcao scored a header against Málaga, forcing Málaga defender Weligton to score an own goal, pushing Atlético to victory in the final minute. He scored once again in an away fixture to Real Sociedad, this time with a rare free-kick – his first professional free kick-goal – in the 90th minute, winning the match 1–0. In a match against Sevilla, Falcao scored a penalty and assisted another goal in a 4–0 victory; the strike marked his 50th goal for Atlético. In the match against Deportivo de La Coruña on 9 December, Falcao scored an astonishing five goals, becoming the first player in La Liga in over a decade to net five goals in a match.\n\nFalcao missed the first La Liga match of 2013 due to an injury, but returned in the second match against Real Zaragoza, where he scored a penalty. It was noted that Falcao struggled to maintain form during the match. In the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarter-finals against Betis, Falcao scored a header in a 2–0 victory.\n\nIn the Copa del Rey semi-finals, Falcao scored against Sevilla in a 2–2 draw, although Atlético advanced to the finals with a 4–3 aggregate scoreline as well as scoring twice before Sevilla. In the league match against Valencia, Falcao scored again in a 1–1 draw. Falcao scored a double against Granada in a comfortable 5–0 victory. The second goal marked Falcao's 200th career goal (counting both club and nation). In an away match against Sevilla, Falcao scored the only goal in a 0–1 victory. In the Madrid Derby against Real Madrid, Falcao scored Atlético's only goal once more, albeit in a 1–2 home loss. Falcao scored the last goal for Atlético in a 3–1 away victory over Celta de Vigo. The win assured Atlético Madrid would appear in the Champions League for next season for the first time in four years.\n\nIn the 2013 Copa del Rey Final, Atlético were trailing 1–0 when Falcao delivered a timely assist to Diego Costa to tie the game. They went on to win 2–1 and defeat their arch-rivals Real Madrid for the first time in 14 years. This was Falcao's first and only domestic cup title with Atlético.\n\nOn 31 May 2013, Atlético Madrid general manager Miguel Ángel Gil Marín announced that the club would not stand in the way if Falcao decided to leave in the next summer transfer window. Despite being linked with various clubs such as Atlético Madrid's city rivals Real Madrid, he signed for newly promoted Ligue 1 side Monaco on 31 May 2013. Falcao subsequently signed a five-year contract for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around €60 million, with his net annual salary at Monaco being reported to be around €18.2 million. Despite the Colombian showing optimism about his Monaco future, Falcao gave an emotional farewell to Atlético during a press interview, expressing his enjoyment with the club and considering it to be \"the best time of his career\". Falcao went on to say that part of his reason for choosing Monaco was to follow the footsteps of his idol, Thierry Henry. Monaco sporting director Vadim Vasilyev said that the club hoped to build a team around Falcao and provide a direct challenge in Ligue 1 to Qatari backed PSG.\n\nFalcao made his Ligue 1 debut in the first match against Bordeaux, where he managed to score in the 88th minute, sealing a 2–0 victory. Against Montpellier, Falcao opened the scoring board with a penalty kick. Monaco went on to win the game 4–1. In a match against Marseille, Falcao scored the equalizer in a 2–1 victory. In a match against Lorient, Falcao scored an early penalty kick, the winner in a 1–0 victory. Falcao managed to equalize with a diving header in a tough away match against French champions Paris Saint-Germain; the game would end 1–1 and keep Monaco on top of the league table. Days later, Falcao scored a double against Bastia in a 3–0 victory. This also brought his goal tally to seven and making him top goal scorer in Ligue 1.\nFalcao ended his four-game goal drought for Monaco in a 2–1 win over Lyon, scoring with an impressive chip. In a match against Evian, Falcao scored the equalizer in a 1–1 draw. On 27 November, it was reported that Falcao failed to fully recover from a thigh injury prior to his last match for the club, and he was forced to miss the next four league matches. Falcao made his return after being brought on within the second half against Valenciennes, where he missed a penalty kick as Monaco lost 2–1.\n\nFalcao started 2014 by making his Coupe de France debut in a match against Vannes, where he both assisted and scored a goal in a 3–2 victory. Falcao's second goal of the month came in the Coupe de France once more, where he scored a goal before being substituted due to an injury in the first half against Monts d'Or Azergues Foot.\n\nOn 23 January, it was confirmed that Falcao had suffered a severe ACL injury and would miss the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while effectively ending his 2013–14 season entirely. Falcao went on to say that he was confident in a speedy recovery. Falcao also went on to say that he wanted to play in the match himself, and that Monaco head coach Claudio Ranieri did not force him to.\n\nFalcao's full recovery was confirmed in mid-July, where he would play regularly in pre-season matches for Monaco after six months sidelined. He returned on the field at the Emirates Cup coming on as a substitute for Dimitar Berbatov in the 72nd minute as Monaco drew 2–2 against Spanish side Valencia. The next day, he played the first hour of the match against Arsenal and scored the only goal of the game in the 36th minute.\n\nOn 10 August, in his first competitive match since his injury, Falcao came on for Lucas Ocampos after 59 minutes and scored a penalty, though Monaco lost 2–1 at home to Lorient. Two weeks later, he started away to Nantes and scored the only goal of the game, heading in Layvin Kurzawa's cross before half-time for the club's first points of the season. Amidst rumours of a transfer, Falcao was not included in Monaco's next match against Lille, and watched from the stands next to club owner Vadim Vasilyev.\n\nOn 1 September 2014, Manchester United agreed to sign Falcao on loan for £6 million subject to a medical examination with an option to sign permanently for £43.5 million (€55 million) at season's end. The deal saw him earn £265,000 per week at the club. Manchester City had previously opted out of signing him due to squad size. United confirmed the transfer in the early hours of 2 September. Despite joining temporarily under a loan contract, Falcao said he would fight to stay at United for many years and become a legend at the club.\nFalcao made his debut at Old Trafford on 14 September, playing the final 23 minutes of a 4–0 win over Queens Park Rangers in place of Juan Mata, as United won for the first time in the season. His debut was marked by rapturous applause from the club's supporters as they continuously chanted his name both while he was warming up and on the pitch. On 5 October, he scored his first goal for United, the winner in a 2–1 home victory against Everton. On 20 December, Falcao made his return for the first time in the starting line-up to score a goal in the second half in a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa. Six days later, he provided an assist for Wayne Rooney against Newcastle United, and United went on to win the match 3–1. On 1 January 2015, Falcao equalised against Stoke City in a 1–1 draw.\n\nHis future at United was put under doubt when his agent, Jorge Mendes, stated at the start of the year that his client \"may not be at Old Trafford at the start of next season but will play in one of the very best clubs in the world\". After failing to offer any shots, either on or off target, against a League One side Preston North End, a BBC commentator, Martin Keown described his struggling performance as \"another night of nothing from Falcao\". On 10 March, a day after being an unused substitute as United were knocked out of the FA Cup at home by Arsenal, Falcao played for their under-21 team in a 1–1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur, being substituted after 72 minutes. The demotion was publicly criticised by former footballers Dietmar Hamann and Willem van Hanegem, whom had described the decision Van Gaal made to be \"disrespectful\" and \"disgraceful\". At season's end, he was adjudged by many to be among the worst signings of the season. On 24 May 2015, United announced their decision to not exercise their buy option on Falcao, ending a spell at the club in which he scored 4 goals in 29 appearances.\n\nOn 3 July 2015, Chelsea signed Falcao on a season-long loan deal with the option of a permanent transfer at the end of the season. It was later revealed that the fee to make the move permanent was set at £38 million (€50 million). The move briefly reunited him with his Colombia teammate Juan Cuadrado and former Atlético Madrid teammates Diego Costa and Thibaut Courtois. Midfielder Mario Pašalić went to Monaco on loan in exchange for Falcao joining Chelsea.\nFalcao made his debut on 2 August in the 2015 FA Community Shield at Wembley Stadium, replacing Loïc Rémy at half time as Chelsea lost 1–0 to rivals Arsenal. His league debut came six days later in a 2–2 home draw with Swansea City, playing the final six minutes in place of Willian. On 29 August, again as a replacement for Willian, Falcao scored his first and only Chelsea goal, equalising in an eventual 1–2 home defeat to Crystal Palace. On 3 November, Falcao picked up a muscular injury in training, and was ruled out for a \"few weeks\", however on 15 January 2016, new manager Guus Hiddink confirmed that Falcao's latest injury setback was \"very serious\". He was dropped from the team's Champions League squad the following month, in favour of new addition Alexandre Pato.\n\nAt the end of the 2015–16 season, Falcao returned to Monaco. Upon his return, Falcao was made team captain by coach Leonardo Jardim. On 27 July 2016, Falcao scored for Monaco in his first appearance for the club in two seasons; a Champions League qualifier against Fenerbahçe S.K.. On 17 September 2016, he scored his first Ligue 1 goal of the season in a 3–0 win over Stade Rennais at the Stade Louis II. On 5 November 2016, he scored twice in the first half as Monaco defeated Nancy 6–0 in a Ligue 1 match, following his two first-half goals against CSKA Moscow in a 2016–17 Champions League group stage match three days earlier.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, Falcao scored his first hat-trick in Ligue 1 in a 4–0 win against Bordeaux which boosted his 2016–17 season tally to 14 goals in 15 competitive games, and 10 goals in Ligue 1 with just 579 minutes of Ligue 1 playing time, meaning that Falcao scored an average of one Ligue 1 goal in every 58 minutes of Ligue 1 playing time.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, Falcao scored two goals, the first with a diving header from Fabinho's cross from the right and the second with a chip over Willy Caballero, but missed a penalty in a 5–3 away loss to Manchester City in the Champions League's round of 16 first leg match. Despite him missing out at the second leg at home due to injury, Monaco eventually won the match 3–1 and eventually qualified to the quarter-finals with away goals rule after a 6–6 aggregate score. On 19 April 2017, he scored in Monaco's 3–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund to put the team into the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2004. Falcao ended the season claiming the Ligue 1 title and as the club's top scorer with 30 goals in 43 appearances.\n\nFalcao started off the season with a goal in Monaco's first league match, Monaco's second in a 3–2 win at home to Toulouse. Two weeks later, he scored the first hat-trick of the Ligue 1 season against Dijon. He then scored a double – including a penalty – against Marseille, raising his tally to seven goals in four matches. Falcao's form led him to being nominated for 2017 Ballon d'Or. Upon scoring for Monaco against former club FC Porto in a Champions League game in December 2017, Falcao refused to celebrate out of respect to his former club. He was applauded by Porto fans for the gesture.\n\nFalcao began the season on a high note during Monaco's first match of the season, assisting Monaco's second and scoring their third in a 1–3 away victory against Nantes.\n\nFalcao played for the Colombia national under-17 team at the 2001 South American Under-17 Football Championship, where he played four matches and scored one goal against Bolivia.\n\nFalcao's first call-up to the under-20 team was for the friendly tournament Copa Simón Bolívar in Venezuela in 2003. He played in the 2004 Toulon Tournament, scoring his only goal at the tournament against Turkey. In the 2005 South American U-20 Championship, where he was champion with his team, he played five matches and scored once, on 23 January in the 1–1 draw against Argentina. In the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, Falcao played three matches and scored twice, against Canada and Syria.\n\nAfter missing the 2007 edition due to injuries, Falcao's first major international tournament was the 2011 Copa América in Argentina. After failing to score against Costa Rica and the hosts, he netted both goals in a 2–0 win against Bolivia, the second a penalty, causing Colombia to top their group. In the quarter-finals, Falcao missed a penalty kick against Peru, which would have won the game had it gone in, and the opponents were able to score two goals in extra time to eliminate his team.\n\nFalcao's first match in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers started off with a goal against Bolivia in the last minute of added time, giving Colombia the win. Under new management of the national team led by Argentine José Pékerman, Falcao scored a goal against Mexico in a friendly that ended 2–0. Falcao's talents were shown against Uruguay, scoring in the second minute to help Colombia win 4–0. In the same match, he assisted Juan Camilo Zúñiga, sealing the 4–0 victory in the final minutes of stoppage time. Falcao scored again days later as well as providing an assist against Chile to help give Colombia a 3–1 away win which put them second in the table, one point behind Argentina. On 12 October 2012, Falcao scored both goals in a 2–0 victory over Paraguay.\n\nIn Falcao's first game for 2013, he played in the qualifying match against Bolivia. Falcao scored in the final minutes of the game scoring the fourth goal. Falcao scored a penalty against Peru in the 13th minute where Colombia won 2–0. On 11 October 2013, in the penultimate World Cup qualifying match against Chile, Falcao scored twice from penalty kicks to tie 3–3 after trailing 0–3. This result ensured Colombia qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1998. Falcao ended the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign as Colombia's top scorer with nine goals.\n\nOn 23 January 2014, due to a severe ACL injury, it was announced that Falcao would likely miss the World Cup. However, Falcao expressed his optimism, believing that it was possible to make a speedy recovery. Falcao received tremendous support worldwide in social media for a speedy recovery; a social media movement entitled 'Fuerza Tigre' (meaning 'stay strong Tiger' in Spanish) rapidly grew popularity.\n\nOn 5 February, Falcao was included in José Pékerman's 30-man squad list (later to be narrowed to 23 in May) for the World Cup. On 25 May, Falcao arrived in Argentina to train with the rest of the squad. However, he eventually made the decision not to join the squad as he did not feel right taking up a position if not at full health.\n\nFalcao would score his first international goal in 11 months after starting for the first time since his injury against El Salvador on 10 October 2014. It was his first ever headed goal for his country while influencing the other two goals in a 3–0 victory. In a friendly against Bahrain on 26 March 2015, Falcao assisted one goal and scored a double in a 6–0 win, making him one goal shy of Arnoldo Iguarán's record as Colombia's top scorer. Four days later, he drew level on 24 goals with Iguarán with a penalty in a 3–1 win over Kuwait.\n\nOn 6 June, he broke the record as Colombia's top scorer by scoring the only goal to defeat Costa Rica in a friendly in Buenos Aires ahead of the 2015 Copa América. He captained the team at the tournament but failed to score in three group matches and he came on as a substitute for Jackson Martínez in the 74th minutes of the quarter-final against Argentina on 26 June; Colombia lost the match in a penalty shootout.\n\nOn 4 November 2016, Falcao was recalled to the Colombia squad for the first time in 388 days for Colombia's next two 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches against Chile on 10 November and Argentina on 15 November. He had last played for Colombia on 13 October 2015, in a 3–0 loss to Uruguay in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match in Montevideo, and had not been selected in Colombia's squad for the Copa América Centenario.\n\nOn 7 June 2017, Falcao became the Colombian national team's all-time top-goalscorer, scoring his 26th goal in a 2–2 draw with Spain. He went on to score twice in the team's four remaining World Cup qualifying matches, as Colombia confirmed their qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup on 10 October 2017. The last qualifying match against Peru ended up in a 1–1 draw, a result that sent Colombia through automatically and Peru into a play-off with New Zealand at Chile's expense as they lost to Brazil. Footage emerged of Falcao was shown talking to the Peruvian players in what was suggested could be an alleged \"pact\" to see both teams through. The Chile Football Federation (ANFP) vice-president, Andrés Fazio Molina, quashed reports they would take the matter further to FIFA.\n\nHaving missed the previous World Cup due to injury, Falcao made his World Cup debut against Japan on 19 June in Colombia's first group game of the 2018 World Cup, with Colombia losing 1–2. On 24 June, Falcao scored his first World Cup goal in Colombia’s 3–0 win over Poland. After his goal, Falcao left the field to a standing ovation, and Colombia boss José Pékerman stated after the game: \"I think [Falcao's goal] is one of the greatest joys that we received tonight. He is a symbol of the national team, a symbol of Colombian football.”\n\nFalcao has been described as a \"natural goal scorer\" and a striker with the \"ability to bag a goal from nothing\". His abilities to adapt to most positions and scoring goals with various parts of his body has resulted in goals. Described as a \"poacher\", Falcao is often labeled as a \"pure striker\", often playing as a traditional \"number 9\" and capitalizing on less amount of chances that are given to him than the typical goal scorer. His footing and curves are highly noticeable through his games regardless of distance and/or positions. Falcao is well known for having a strong weak foot (left) that is on equals with his right foot (preference), allowing him to be flexible with goal scoring. Falcao controls a well-balanced pace, helping him keep his stamina in check and allowing him to often outrun other players in the most critical battling-for-the-ball moments. The strength of his shots is often well controlled, in terms of distance and angles, as shown throughout his career. While Falcao is only of average height, his header technique has given him an edge in aerial battles for balls. His most impressive goals tend to be headers, with the majority of his goals coming from the air.\n\nFalcao's talents have been recognized by former and current football players. Former Barcelona and current Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola described him as \"sensational\" and as one of the most talented in the world. Before Falcao's ACL injury, Fabio Capello considered him to be on the same level as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Former Atlético Madrid teammate Gabi said in 2012 that he thought Falcao was the best at heading the ball in the world. In his prime before his ACL injury, he was often considered one of the best strikers in the world.\n\nFalcao is a second generation footballer, with his father, Radamel García, having played professionally as a defender in Colombia and Venezuela, moving to the latter country when Falcao was five. At first, he was picked on in Venezuela for not being good at the country's most popular sport, baseball. García died on 3 January 2019.\n\nHis name derives from the 1980s Brazil national team, Internacional and Roma legend Paulo Roberto Falcão, as a tribute from his father, Radamel García. Despite being named Radamel, he prefers to use his middle name in interviews. Falcao is married to Argentine singer Lorelei Tarón. In early 2013, it was revealed that Falcao was expecting his first child with her. Dominique García Tarón was born on 13 August 2013, at the Princess Grace Hospital in La Colle, Monaco. His second daughter, Desirée García Tarón, was born in February 2015. His third daughter, Annette García Tarón, was born in August 2017. Due to his wife's Polish ancestry, his children also hold Polish passports thanks to Monaco teammate Kamil Glik, who helped with the process. Falcao is a Christian.\n\nHe is partially of English descent; George King, one of his great-grandfathers, emigrated from the North Yorkshire village of Burn near Selby in 1932 to work as an accountant for the United Fruit Company in Colombia. Owing to this ancestry, Falcao's father attempted to make it easier for his son to play in Europe by obtaining a British passport for him, however this was rejected. His uncle was the telenovelas and film actor Herbert King.\n\nRiver Plate\n\nPorto\n\nAtlético Madrid\n\nMonaco\n\nColombia U20\n\nIndividual\n\nRecords\n\n", "id": "7698038", "categories": ["Argentine Primera División players", "Association football forwards", "Colombian emigrants to Venezuela", "Colombia international footballers", "AS Monaco FC players", "River Plate footballers", "Expatriate footballers in Portugal", "Colombian expatriate sportspeople in Spain", "Recipients of the Order of Boyaca", "Colombian expatriate sportspeople in Monaco", "Primeira Liga players", "UEFA Europa League winning players", "1986 births", "Expatriate footballers in Argentina", "Colombian footballers", "Living people", "People from Santa Marta", "Lanceros Boyacá footballers", "2011 Copa América players", "La Liga players", "Chelsea F.C. players", "Manchester United F.C. players", "Premier League players", "Expatriate footballers in Spain", "Colombian Christians", "Colombian expatriate sportspeople in Portugal", "Colombian expatriate footballers", "Colombian people of English descent", "Atlético Madrid footballers", "Colombian expatriate sportspeople in Argentina", "Expatriate footballers in England", "Colombian expatriate sportspeople in England", "2015 Copa América players", "FC Porto players", "Ligue 1 players", "Expatriate footballers in Monaco", "Colombia under-20 international footballers"], "title": "Radamel Falcao"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7698053", "text": "Panjshir offensives\n\nThe Panjshir offensives ( – Panjsher Operations) were a series of battles between the Soviet Army and groups of Afghan Mujahideen under Ahmad Shah Massoud for the control of the strategic Panjshir Valley, during the Soviet–Afghan War in the period from 1980 to 1985.\n\nThese battles saw some of the most violent fighting of the whole war, during the nine campaigns launched, coordinated Soviet assaults would regularly drive out the Mujahideen from the valley but they would return as soon as the Soviets left.\n\nThe Panjshir Valley lies 70 km north of Kabul, in the Hindu Kush mountains close to the Salang Pass, which connects Kabul to the northern areas of Afghanistan and further on to Uzbekistan, then part of the Soviet Union. In June 1979, an insurrection led by Ahmed Shah Massoud expelled all government forces, and the valley became a guerrilla stronghold. From the Panjshir, Mujahideen groups frequently carried out ambushes against Soviet convoys bringing supplies to the 40th Army stationed in Afghanistan. The Salang Pass became a dangerous area, and Soviet truck drivers were even awarded decorations for having successfully crossed it. The pressure on the logistic system determined the Soviet command to try and dislodge the rebels.\n\nSoviet offensives into the Panjshir Valley had three main tactical features. There was (1) the concentration of air assets, including extensive aerial bombardment of a target area followed by (2) the landing of helicopter forces to stop the withdrawal of enemy forces and engage the enemy from unexpected directions and (3) a drive by of mechanized forces into areas of guerrilla support in conjunction with the helicopter landing parties. It was these kinds of tactics that caused so much destruction in the civilian populations in these regions. By forcing the mass migration of civilians from the Panjshir Valley and destroying all crops and livestock, the Soviets hoped to deprive Ahmad Shah Massoud of resources to sustain his full-time fighters.\n\nThis tactic had some success as in order to rebuild his organization Massoud was forced to sign a cease fire treaty in January 1983 that would last for one year. The bottom line though was that these victories were temporary. There were serious issues with this tactic of large punitive offensives that contributed to the stalemate that characterized the war. Mujahideen forces would often learn of coming offensives in advance from their compatriots in the DRA army. Not only could civilians and guerrillas move safely out of the way of the majority of the bombs but guerrillas could also plan ambushes, lay mines, and move weapons caches. Once armored personnel carriers and helicopters came the guerrillas would retreat into the side valleys and carry out small ambushes rather than openly confront the Soviets.\n\nThe first Soviet operation in Panjshir took place in April 1980, just four months after the arrival of Soviet forces in Afghanistan. It involved three Soviet battalions, of which one was the fourth battalion of the 56th Guards Air Assault Brigade led by Captain Leonid Khabarov, and 1000 men of the Afghan army and security forces. The overall commander of the operation was General Pechevoy. \n\nThe Mujahideen numbered only 1,000 according to Soviet intelligence or no more than 200 according to Afghan sources. They were armed only with antiquated rifles and had not constructed any defensive works but laid mines on the only road. The advance proceeded up the valley, capturing Bazarak after a fight and overunning Massoud's headquarters in Pasishah-Mardan where various documents were found. Khabarov was injured in the fighting, taking a bullet to the forearm. The rebels deliberately let the Soviet/DRA force into the valley and ambushed them as they withdrew. During the four-day operation, the Soviets claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels but the Mujahideen newspaper \"Call of Jihad\" put their losses at four killed.\n\nThe first operation had installed a garrison of Afghan troops in a fort in the town of Rokha, but they quickly came uder siege by the Mujahideen and suffered constant losses from harassing fire. Beginning on August 28, a new offensive, dubbed Panjshir I, was carried out by Afghan and Soviet troops. It included for the first time a heliborne landing by air assault troops. As before the Mujahideen did not oppose the offensive frontally but harassed and ambushed the Soviets and DRA troops as they passed. The operation lasted 21 days. The Mujahideen admitted to 25 killed in their own ranks but claimed to have inflicted 500 casualties on their opponents and shot down several helicopters.\n\nDespite the operation, rebel pressure on Rokha including the use of captured artillery pieces did not let up. On November 8, a convoy of government trucks escorted by Soviet armoured vehicles reached the besieged post. Dismounted Soviet and DRA troops engaged the Mujahideen on the heights around the town in an effort to break the siege. One of Massoud's subcommanders was killed and the surrounding villages suffered heavily from indiscriminate bombing by Soviet aircraft, but the siege continued.\n\nThe final operation of 1980 began on December 12. Heavy airstrikes hit the valley causing the death of 100 civilians and 15 Mujahideen. The fort at Rokha was finally evacuated on December 27, and the operation ended two days later, leaving the valley mostly under rebel control.\n\nBy this time, Massoud had mustered enough men to openly resist the Soviet assault. During this offensive, to avoid losing vehicles to land mines, the Soviets sent their sapper units to clear the way in front of the main force. This tactic proved costly, and the attack force penetrated only 25 km into the valley before retiring, after having suffered 100 casualties.\n\nBy 1982 Massoud had built up his forces to 3,000 men, and other Mujahideen from neighbouring areas could come to his aid The approaches to the valley were strengthened with defensive positions established on dominant heights and near narrow passages. Hollowed-out caves were used as supply depots and shelters.\n\nThe first major offensive was carried out by a force of 12,000 Afghan and Soviet soldiers under the command of General Norat Ter-Grigoryants with 320 armoured vehicles, 155 artillery pieces, and supported by 104 helicopters and 26 airplanes. The Soviet units involved were the 108th Motor Rifle Division, 201st Motor Rifle Division, the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, who each contributed one regiment, the 66th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade, elements of the 860th Separate Motor-Rifle Regiment, the 191st Separate Motor-Rifle Regiment and the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment. The plan for the operation was prepared in secret by a small number of 40th Army officers. In order to deceive the Mujahideen a diversionary attack up the Ghorband valley was planned. This was presented as the real attack to the Afghan Army staff, which included Mujahideen sympathizers, and who then leaked the plan to the resistance. \n\nThe main assault began on the night of May 16, after an intense aviation and artillery bombardment. While motorized rifle battalions, preceded by reconnaissance units, attacked the dominating features at the entrance of the valley, airborne units were airlifted by helicopter behind the main Mujahideen defenses. In all, 4,200 troops were airlifted into the valley to capture strategic points, right up to the Pakistani border, in an effort to cut the Mujahideen supply lines. In some areas the fighting was intense: when a Soviet paratrooper regiment landed east of Rukha, it was quickly encircled and suffered significant losses. The beleaguered paratroopers were saved only by the arrival of a motorised rifle battalion led by Major Aushev, who forced his way through the Mujahideen defenses, consisting of well-located strong points, and captured Rukha. For his actions, Aushev was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nMassoud, who expected an attack similar to the previous ones, had disposed his defenses close to the entrance of the valley, and was thus unable to prevent the Soviets from gaining footholds in the Panjshir. They established three main bases at Rukha, Bazarak and Anava. Most of the Mujahideen had survived the attack and Massoud divided them into small, mobile groups that fought the Soviets all down the valley.\n\nDuring this offensive, the Soviets managed to occupy a large part of the Panjshir and scored some successes against Massoud's organization, such as the capture of a list of the names of 600 of his agents in Kabul. However, most of the rebels had escaped capture, and this was not the decisive victory the Soviets had been hoping for. Also, their heavily fortified bases only gave them control over the valley floor, while the surrounding heights were still held by the Mujahideen. For this reason they decided to launch a sixth offensive.\n\nThe sixth offensive consisted of a series of sweeps conducted by motorized units and by airborne Spetsnaz units, launched from their bases in the Panjshir, to find and destroy the Mujahideen hideouts. It was accompanied by a heavy aerial bombardment of villages suspected of harbouring rebel groups, notably carried out by Tu-16 bombers flying from inside the Soviet Union. Airborne Troops carried out search and destroy missions, encircling Massoud's mobile units and destroying some of them. However, as a rule attrition among the Mujahideen was low, and the brunt of the attacks fell on the civilian population, who suffered heavily, many of them preferring to flee the valley.\n\nDespite bitter fighting, the Soviets were unable to eradicate the Mujahideen, and the battle soon developed into a stalemate. During the 5th and 6th offensives the Soviets suffered up to 3,000 casualties, and 1,000 Afghan Army soldiers defected to the Mujahideen.\n\nOnce the height of the offensive had passed, many areas captured by the Soviet forces were handed over to Afghan army units, who suffered from low morale and high desertion rates. They were the targets for Massoud's counterattacks. In a series of surprise attacks, several government outposts fell to the rebels. The first was the Afghan Army outpost at Saricha, which the Mujahideen captured along with 80 prisoners and 8 tanks, despite having to cross a minefield. The government post at Birjaman fell soon after, and the Mujahideen were able to recapture some areas in this way. These operations, along with the continued harassment of Soviet garrisons and resupply convoys, proved that the Mujahideen were far from defeated, and convinced the Soviets that they must negotiate a truce with Massoud.\n\nIn January 1983, for the first time a ceasefire was concluded between the Soviets and the Mujahideen, lasting 6 months, and later extended. Negotiated by Massoud in person with a colonel of the GRU, Anatoly Tkachev, the agreement stipulated that Soviet troops should evacuate the Panjshir, except for a small garrison at Anava, whose access was controlled by the Mujahideen. The area covered by the ceasefire included the Panjshir valley, but not the Salang pass, where fighting continued.\n\nMassoud took advantage of the truce to extend his influence over areas that had until then been held by hostile factions loyal to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-islami party, like in Andarab District. More peacefully, he took control of the Khost-Fereng sector, and some areas in southern Takhar Province, while establishing contacts with other guerrilla groups in Baghlan Province, and persuading them to adopt his military organisation. He also ordered the strengthening of defenses in five subsidiary valleys as well as in the Panjshir, permitting a defense in depth, and withdrew his headquarters to Shira Mandara, in Takhar province, in anticipation of a renewed assault.\n\nIn February 1984, Konstantin Chernenko replaced Yuri Andropov as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. While Andropov had supported the ceasefire, Chernenko, a disciple of Brezhnev, believed that the guerrillas should be rooted out through military action, an opinion which he shared with Babrak Karmal, president of the DRA. As a result a new offensive was planned, which, in Karmal's words, should be decisive and merciless, and in order to destroy the Panjshir valley bases, all those living there should be killed. It was the largest offensive in the region to date.\n\nHowever, some Soviets, who were supporters of Andropov, disagreed with this policy, and they gave Massoud advance warning of the attack. Through this channel, and thanks to his agents in the DRA government, Massoud had a precise idea of the Soviet plans, and he was able to counter them. To avoid civilian casualties, all 30,000 inhabitants of the Panjshir (from a population of 100,000 before the war) were evacuated to safe areas. Only ambush parties were left to delay the Soviet advance. All the roads, villages and helicopter landing zones were heavily mined. All these preparations were carried out in secret, and a token activity was maintained near the Soviet base at Anava, to deceive the Soviets into believing that a conventional defense was being prepared.\n\n11,000 Soviet and 2,600 Afghan soldiers, under Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergei Sokolov participated in the offensive, supported by 200 airplanes and 190 helicopters. On April 22, after a two-day bombardment of the region by Tu-16, Tu-22M and Su-24 bombers, they advanced rapidly into the Panjshir. Several battalion strength forces were placed at key passes leading out of the Panjshir Valley while at the same time large helicopter troop landings were made in tributary valleys connected to the Panjshir. By blocking the Mujahideen's withdrawal routes and securing the high ground, the Soviets forced them higher into the mountains then they had previously ventured and scattered their strength as they attempted to avoid being trapped by the helicopter landings. Once the strength of Massoud's forces were dealt such a deadly blow, rather than withdrawing from the valley as they had previously done they began setting up a system of forts and posts throughout the main valley while relinquishing control of the side valleys. These tactics proved more effective at rooting out insurgents and breaking up their fighting forces during the offensive but had limited long term success. The forts and outposts along the Panjshir Valley were unable to protect roads and convoys as well as they had hoped and these installations proved attractive targets for the Mujahideen to harass. Much of the valley was occupied, but the Soviets paid a heavy price; many soldiers were killed by mines and in ambushes. During one battle, on April 30 in the Hazara Valley, the 1st Battalion of the 682nd Motor Rifle Regiment was decimated: the losses of Soviet troops were estimated at 60 killed.\n\nFor the Soviets, the operation was partly successful – some of the infrastructure of the Mujahideen, created in the time of the truce in 1982–1983, was destroyed. Babrak Karmal completed a propaganda visit to the Panjshir, which for some time had become a safe zone. However, it quickly became apparent that most of Massoud's forces had escaped the onslaught, and were still able to carry out their harassment tactics. Eventually, in September, the Soviet-DRA forces once again evacuated the Panjshir Valley, leaving occupying forces only in the lower Panjshir.\n\nYousaf and Adkin reported in 1992 that the Soviet forces involved included the 180th Motor Rifle Regiment, battalions of the 66th Motor Rifle Brigade and 191st Motor Rifle Regiment, a regiment of the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, a battalion of the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment, accompanied by Afghan forces including the 8th Division, the 20th Division, and the 37th Commando Brigade. It seems likely that the reference to the '180th Motor Rifle Regiment' refers to the 682nd Motor Rifle Regiment of the 108th Motor Rifle Division, based in Kabul.\n\nThe 8th offensive was a follow-up to the 7th, involving mostly airborne forces.\n\nThe 9th offensive was carried out in reprisal for the destruction of the DRA garrison at Peshgur, during which Massoud's mobile groups took 500 prisoners including 126 officers and killed a brigadier of the Afghan Army. The prisoners had been marched into the mountains, where the Mujahideen claimed they were killed by a Soviet aerial bombardment, a claim others dubbed suspicious.\n\nInitiated hours after the raid, the Soviet counter-attack installed a new garrison in Peshgur, and pursued the retreating Mujahideen. The group escorting the captured Afghan officers was caught in the open by Soviet helicopters, and in the ensuing fight most of the prisoners were killed, with both sides projecting on each other the responsibility for the incident. \n\nIn 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev announced his intention of withdrawing the Soviet contingent from Afghanistan. From then on the Soviets were mostly concerned with avoiding losses in the Panjshir sector, and they observed a tacit ceasefire: unprovoked shooting by Soviet troops was forbidden, and the Mujahideen refrained from attacking Soviet bases. Despite provocations ordered by Najibullah's government to draw the Soviets into further fighting, the situation generally remained calm, enabling Massoud to carry out his \"strategic offensive\", capturing much of Baghlan and Takhar provinces. The last Soviet and Afghan troops present in the lower Panjshir were finally evacuated in June 1988.\n\n", "id": "7698053", "categories": ["Battles of the Soviet–Afghan War", "Battles involving Afghanistan", "Battles involving the Soviet Union"], "title": "Panjshir offensives"}

Each episode was about 20 minutes long. During the opening credits of \"Through the Dragon's Eye\" a book with the same title opened at a specific \"Chapter\" (for example, \"Chapter 1: The Dragon from Pelamar\").\n\nThree children (Jenny, Scott and Amanda) pass through a mural they have been painting and find themselves in the magical land of Pelamar. There, Gorwen the dragon tells them that the \"life source\" of Pelamar, the Veetacore has exploded. He then asks for their help to re-build it. They then travel to the Veetacore House and meet the Veetacore Keepers, Boris, Morris and Doris. The episode ends with Amanda finding out that three Veetons are missing.The Dragon From Pelamar was Distributed in the UK on 19 September 1989.\n\nGorwen the Dragon believes that the missing Veetons must have fallen beyond the mountains of Pelamar into the strange land of Widge. Amanda, Scott, Boris, Rodey and Gorwen set off to find the lost Veetons and the quest begins. Jenny stays behind with the other two Veetacore Keepers, Doris and Morris to help them read a book on how to put the Veetacore back together again.\n\nBoris and Amanda crash land into a \"high fade zone\" of Widge and have to leave quickly because Rodey (a giant talking mouse) shrinks. When the air gets too thin for Boris and Gorwen to fly through the search party land at Border Camp in Widge. The Widgets (the native inhabitants of Widge – small squirrel-like animals) let them stay for the night. In the morning, they help Scott and Rodey as to which road they should take (Rodey could speak \"Widgen\" – the language of Widge).\n\nWith the Widgets as their guides, the search party set off through the Woods of Widge. Jenny tries to contact Gorwen on a videophone to ask whether Boris took a \"veetarod\" with him (a long, thin instrument the Keepers use to locate Veetons with). Scott starts to suspect that the Widgets are not all that they seem, when Boris falls into a quagmire, which could have been avoided if Boris could have read the sign saying \"Danger! Quagmire!\". Rodey the mouse goes off in a huff, and the others leave him to catch up with them. The veetarod (which Boris had taken with him) works and leads the party to a huge tree (unfortunately the door into the tree is locked).\n\nThe Widgets have hidden the first Veeton inside a huge book tree. Boris and Amanda manage to unlock it and enter it in search of the Veeton, while Scott and the dragon Gorwen search for Rodey, who is still missing. Boris and Amanda follow some signs to the library. Inside Boris solves a clue, and finds the first Veeton. The kindly Book Tree lets Boris take some books with him for when he can read. They find the way out and try contacting Doris with the news, however Doris never replies. The credits roll up on Doris with a huge look of shock and absolute terror on her face.\n\nWith the help of the veetarod, Scott and Gorwen find Boris, Amanda and the first Veeton in a gravel pit (the exit of the Book Tree). Then it starts to snow. Scott finds a \"snowflake clue\", which tells them to go to Ash Rock. They set out through the snow, however almost as soon as they set off, the Widgets corner them and engage them in a snowball fight. After the fight, which everyone enjoys, Scott, Boris and Gorwen find that the Widgets have taken the Veeton and Boris' rucksack, and that they have kidnapped Amanda. Gorwen sets off to find them, while Boris and Scott continue to Ash Rock.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Veetacore House, we find out why Doris is not replying to Boris' message. Charn, the Evil One, an exiled Pelamot, has returned to try to take over Pelamar. Boris can only see the back of Doris' head in his videophone, and therefore thinks Doris is simply being rude when she cuts him off. At the Veetacore House, Charn reveals his plan. When the Veetacore is mended, he will chant a spell, which must be chanted as the last Veeton is fitted, with malevolant words rather than the kind and hopeful ones at the back of the book. Jenny at first stands up to Charn, refusing to mend the Veetacore for his purposes, but he scares her into obedience by melting Frug, Morris' pet caterpillar, with his magic hands; if he points at something and keeps his hand on it, a jet of green light shoots out of his hand and melts the object he is pointing at. He threatens to melt Morris as well, but Jenny decides it would be safer to help him after all. Doris tries to contact Boris as discreetly as possible, but Charn sees her at the last minute, and melts her.\n\nAmanda chases the Widgets who stole Boris' rucksack (with the Veeton in it). She rescues it and in doing so, finds Rodey, but they find themselves lost in the snow. Boris and Scott find another clue at Ash Rock. They leave a sign for Amanda and Gorwen to follow. The veetarod then leads them up to the top of a mountain. When they are about halfway up, some rocks hit Boris on the head. One of the rocks is not a rock at all, it is a Veeton. Gorwen catches up with Amanda and Rodey and they continue up to the top of the mountain, where they treat Boris' head and contact Jenny again.\n\nAt the Veetacore House, Jenny persuades Charn to let Morris knit her a scarf. She continues to read the book for Charn, who cannot read, and re-builds the Veetacore. When the search party contact Jenny, she holds up Morris' scarf. On the scarf are the words \"HELP! CHARN!\" Gorwen decides to return to Pelamar alone, with the two Veetons. He leaves Rodey, Amanda, Boris and Scott to find the last Veeton by themselves.\n\n\"No-one can face Charn and live. Only Gorwen has a chance... \" \nDuring the night, the search party pitch a tent and spend the night at the top of the mountains. During the night, two troublesome Widgets sneak into the tent and steal Boris' map of Widge. They rip the map up, leaving Boris, Amanda, Scott and Rodey alone with no \"map, no time and no words to help\" them. Suddenly, a waterfall of words appears gushing down the mountainside, giving them a clue as what to do next.\n\nMeanwhile, Gorwen makes his way back through Widge by night. He appears outside the Veetacore House, where he is seen by Jenny and Charn. Morris goes out the back door of the house to try and tell Gorwen.\n\nGorwen returns to the Veetacore House, where Charn is waiting for him. Morris tries to warn him, but is zapped by Charn. There is a great battle and Charn is eventually beaten forever; Charn had already been beaten once by Gorwen and as a result was banished from Pelamar.\n\nAfter the battle, Gorwen knows he still has time to save Morris, Doris, Frug and the rest of Morris' pets that Charn had melted, even though he, himself is becoming weaker and weaker. Doris then sends a message to Scott, Rodey, Amanda and Boris: Charn beaten but Gorwen fading. Hurry! Then Rodey finds a tunnel through the mountains.\n\nRodey rescues the veetarod, which had fallen down a deep chasm in the tunnel. The veetarod leads them up to the top of the mountain. Then Boris realises that the Widgets had taken his bat. Amanda persuades Boris to swap some of the books that the Book Tree had given him for the bat. The Widgets agree.\n\nAt the Veetacore House, the Veetacore is still unfinished. Frug meanwhile has become a very large cocoon and Gorwen has faded so much he is almost invisible. Jenny tries conatacting Boris to tell him to hurry up. Scott and Amanda spot the last Veeton balanced on a tree that has fallen over, wedged between two cliffs.\n\nScott, with the help of the Widgets, manages to rescue the last Veeton. Boris, Amanda and Scott then start the long trek down to the bottom of the mountain after thanking and waving to the Widgets who make a banner for them out of a picnic cloth, which says \"\"Goodbye! Good Luck!\"\"'.\n\nMeanwhile, Doris and Morris fit the penultimate piece of the Veetacore and wait for the others to return with the last Veeton.\n\nBoris, Amanda and Scott continue through the Woods of Widge until they reach Border Camp. Boris pulls out his magical flying bat and flies home to Pelamar with Scott and Amanda clasping onto the bat with him.\n\nAt the Veetacore House, Doris, Morris and Jenny gather round a cracked wall and measure the distance. They are convinced that it is getting bigger. A short while later, after Boris is shown encouraging his bat to go faster, Jenny measures the crack again, while Doris and Morris are asleep with Frug. Gorwen has almost vanished now; he is so pale.\n\nThe search party crash-land in Pelamar, miles away from the Veetacore House. To get to the house, Boris makes his cricket bat into a skateboard. They burst into the Veetacore House, on top of Doris, who had just declared that she did not believe that they were coming. They take out the Veeton and look for which way up it is supposed to go. Jenny looks in the book, which tells the Keepers how to fix the Veetacore, however she finds that Frug had eaten the last page.\n\nJust then Frug erupts from his cocoon, revealing the last four words of the missing sentence in the book on each of his four wings. The Veetacore Keepers and the children work out what the sentence is and the last Veeton is placed, by Morris, Doris and Boris, into the Veetacore, while chanting the spell. The Veetacore glows and hums causing Gorwen to come back, Rodey to return to his normal size and the rest of Pelamar to fill with life again.\n\nWith their mission complete, the children return to their own world - only a short time after they left it. They all find a miniature veeton in their pockets as a gift from Pelamar - proving their adventure really did happen. \n\n", "id": "7698064", "categories": ["Lists of children's television series episodes", "Look and Read"], "title": "List of Through the Dragon's Eye episodes"}

It is the successor of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ30.\n\nWhile the FZ30 was a major upgrade of the FZ20 both internally and externally, the FZ50 differs relatively little from the FZ30. The main differences are:\n\nThe camera is known for its high-quality optics and effective optical image stabilization system. Many professional reviews have commended it for its excellent pictures at ISO 100, but it has a reputation for excessively \"smeary\" noise reduction at higher ISO settings, a problem that can be ameliorated by using the RAW capture mode. It uses proprietary lithium-ion batteries. There is no storage built into the camera; an MMC, SD, or SDHC memory card is required. High-speed SD cards up to 2 GB and SDHC cards up to 32GB are supported.\n\nThe camera has many SLR-like handling features — dual control wheels for aperture and shutter speed, manual focus (focus-by-wire) and zoom rings, and a flash hot shoe. It is among the largest non-SLR cameras built, and is positioned at the high end of the bridge-camera market.\n\nZooming while recording movies is supported since the zoom is manual. The camera also includes an \"extended optical zoom\" system providing greater optical zoom ability when shooting at lower resolutions, giving up to 19.3× zoom at 3MP. Essentially, this just crops the center out of the image in-camera, but can be useful for metering and framing purposes. Apertures from 2.8 to 11 are supported, though the largest apertures are not available at high zoom levels (3.7 at full zoom). Shutter speeds range from 60 s to 1/2000 s, although shutter speeds faster than 1/1000 s are not available at the widest apertures. Several different auto-focus modes are available. The AF-macro setting can be selected for all camera modes. Macro capability is not outstanding (5 cm minimum focal range at 1× zoom), and the tele-macro capability present on the lower-end Panasonic FZ models (the ability to focus down to 1 m at 420 mm) is not present; the FZ50 can only focus down to 2 m at 420 mm. However, the FZ50 is commonly used to record high-magnification macro images with an inexpensive conversion lens; the most commonly used lens for this purpose is the 8-diopter Raynox 250.\n\nThe FZ50 has a screw mount to accept 55 mm filters, and is compatible with a wide variety of Panasonic-branded and third-party lens converters which can provide greater wide-angle, telephoto and close-up capabilities.\n\nThe FZ50 can also record in a RAW format which is supported by Adobe Camera Raw and the free UFRaw plugin for GIMP and many other third-party programs; the camera comes with a special version of Silkypix for conversion. RAW files are recorded in around three seconds with fast SD cards, which is one of the best results among non-digital single-lens reflex cameras; however, there is no RAW buffer as on many digital SLR's. Unlike its predecessors, the FZ50 does not support TIFF format.\n\nThe zoom and focus mechanism is internal: the lens does not physically extend beyond the camera housing when focusing and zooming. Startup is under one second, as the lens does not need to be extended.\n\n\n", "id": "7698089", "categories": ["Superzoom cameras", "Leica", "Panasonic Lumix cameras", "Bridge digital cameras"], "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50"}

He was the younger son, and youngest child, of Shane Leslie, and his wife Marjorie (née Ide) Leslie. His father was a first cousin of Sir Winston Churchill.\n\nDuring his lifetime he served as a Spitfire pilot in the RAF during World War II, became one of the first pioneers of electronic music, and co-authored one of the first books on UFOs, \"Flying Saucers Have Landed\" (1953), with writer and UFO contactee George Adamski.\n\nDesmond is probably most famous for punching theatre critic Bernard Levin in front of eleven million viewers during an edition of the live satirical TV show \"That Was The Week That Was\" in 1962. Ostensibly this was to protect the honour of his then-wife, Agnes Bernelle, in response to Levin's critical review of her show, \"Savagery and Delight\".\n\nBernelle stated in her biography, \"The Fun Palace\", that the show was poorly received due to Desmond's custom-built loudspeakers being moved below the stage, and that Desmond had failed to check the situation, missing the show for a social appointment. As a consequence no one behind the front two rows heard a word she sang. She claimed he probably punched Levin more out of embarrassment than loyalty. Levin's obituaries described Leslie only as an expert on UFOs.\n\nThroughout his life, Desmond Leslie published several books, including a number on the subject of UFOs—the first of which, \"Flying Saucers Have Landed\", was co-authored with George Adamski. He also wrote a series of satirical books ranging from \"The Jesus File\", dealing with the crucifixion of Christ as recorded through the paper-work and internal correspondences of the Roman Garrison, to \"How Britain Won The Space Race\", which he co-wrote with celebrated amateur astronomer Patrick Moore.\n\nDesmond Leslie was briefly a screenwriter/director for film and television.\n\n\nDuring financial difficulties during the production of \"Stranger At My Door\", Desmond opted to compose the music for the film himself. Some stated the music was the best part of the film. In the early 1950s Leslie designed the world's first effective multi-track sound mixing desk which he had built by Rupert Neve. It can still be seen in his family home Castle Leslie, Monaghan, where it has been an object of reverence for visitors such as Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, he began nurturing his interest in contemporary music. In his small home studio, he experimented with the sounds of musique concrète. In January 1960, Leslie pressed a single acetate called \"Music of the Future\". All Leslie recordings were later licensed to Joseph Weinburger, and Leslie's recordings were pressed onto a short series of 78rpm library discs, occasionally being put to use in science and mystery based programing, such as early \"Doctor Who\" episodes. He used a great number of tape sources to create his pieces; some sources he mentions in his liner notes are motor horns, humming tops and bells.\n\nIn 2005, Jonny Trunk's British record label, Trunk Records, re-released Desmond's 1960 acetate, never before released commercially. The sounds on this release were mastered from the original acetate. The recordings are believed to have been made between 1955 and 1959, and included are Desmond's original sleevenotes, containing information pertaining to each selection.\n\nHis first wife was Agnes Elizabeth Bernauer (Agnes Bernelle) on 18 August 1945. That marriage ended in divorce. The couple had two sons and one daughter:\n\n\nHe remarried, to Jennifer Helen Strong, in 1970; they had two daughters:\n\nDuring the 1990s he devoted his time to restoring the aging family home of Castle Leslie which eventually opened to the public. He later relocated to Nice, France. Emphysema claimed his life in Antibes in 2001, aged 79.\n\n\n", "id": "7698231", "categories": ["People from County Monaghan", "2001 deaths", "1921 births", "Disease-related deaths in France", "Younger sons of baronets", "Deaths from emphysema"], "title": "Desmond Leslie"}

In 2010, Israel became the chair of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. , cut diamonds constituted 23.2% of Israel's total exports and they were the country's biggest export product, amounting to 12% of the world's production.\n\nDiamond cutting is a traditional Jewish craft with centuries of history. In the late 15th century, Jewish diamond cutter Lodewyk van Berken invented the scaif polishing wheel, a technological innovation that revolutionized the industry.\n\nWhat was to become the Israeli diamond industry began in 1937, eleven years before the State of Israel was established, when the first diamond polishing plant was opened in Petah Tikva by refugee experts from the Netherlands. In 1938 the 15% import duty on imported rough stones was removed. By 1944 the industry employed 3,300 workers in 33 factories, with £P 1,320,000 capital investment, entirely Jewish. The value of exports was over £P 3,200,000 mainly to the United States, Canada, and India; it was the largest value of any single commodity exported from Mandatory Palestine that year.\n\nBetween 1944 and 1948 the industry suffered from the increasing lawlessness and in February 1948 closed down completely.\n\nAfter a state was declared, the consumer economy was shifted to a war economy. This came at the height of a diamond crisis, as many war-torn economies were struggling to re-establish.\n\nDuring the first fifteen years of Israel's existence, diamonds and Jaffa oranges were the new state's main export products.\n\nAfter reaching its lowest point in the wake of the 1948 closedown, the industry has continued to grow, producing a world leader in the diamond industry.\n\nIn the beginning of the 21st century, Israel is one of the world's three major centers for polished diamonds, alongside Belgium and India. Israel's net polished diamond exports slid 22.8% in 2012 as polished diamond exports fell to $5.56 billion from $7.2 billion in 2011.

The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, among others, has called for diamonds processed in Israel to be considered conflict diamonds. \n\n", "id": "7698260", "categories": ["Economy of Israel"], "title": "Diamond industry in Israel"}

It has an enrollment of approximately 200 students. The school colors are blue and gold and the mascot is a Mustang.\n\nThe school district comprises territory along the boundary of Shawano and Waupaca counties, and includes the communities of Caroline, Leopolis, and the Town of Pella. At one time, Caroline had its own elementary school, however, because of small enrollment it was sold to the local American Legion group. Students from Caroline have attended Marion's elementary school since the early 1980s.\n\nAlthough Marion has had several high school and elementary buildings in its history, the main building has usually been on School Street in downtown Marion. The elementary school and the high school were at one time in the same building. A fire in 1985 caused high school classes to be moved to the elementary school, while elementary classes were moved to various locations around Marion, such as churches, while a new high school, connected to the old gymnasium, was built on School Street. The separate elementary building for K-6 is located five blocks north of the junior-senior high school, just off Main Street. A field house was added to the elementary school in 1998, where many events are now held.\n\nMarion High School has extracurricular programs, such as music, FFA, FCCLA, forensics, and other academic groups. Every year, students represent the school at state and national levels in FFA, as well as at state competitions in music and forensics.\n\nMarion High School participates in the Central Wisconsin Conference - small division, or CWC-Small, in the following sports: cross country, football, volleyball, basketball, baseball, softball, golf, and track and field. Local churches and groups also sponsor summer baseball and softball teams and tournaments.\n\nAlthough Marion High School discontinued its wrestling program because of declining participation, the school had its first state champion in 1997. \n\nIn February 2015, Marion approved a wrestling co-op with the neighboring city o Clintonville.\n\nA Marion High School pole vaulter took first at the state meet in 1995.\n\nThe cross country program was discontinued for many years because of declining involvement, however, it experienced a resurgence in the late 1990s. This was followed by the boys' team finishing seventh at the state meet in 1997.\n\nThe softball team won the WIAA State Class C tournament in 1985, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1991, and 1992.\n\nThe baseball team captured its first WIAA State Championship in 2009.\n\nKen Frailing of the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs is a Marion High School graduate.\n\nWith the building of Marion's first community golf course, Perry's Landing, a golf team was started. The golf season is in the spring and allows boys and girls to play.\n\nThe girls' basketball team lost to Iola in the regional playoffs in 2000. It won the CWC-10 Conference championship in 2014. \n\nThe boys' basketball team, in both the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons, lost in the sectional finals, capping 21-win seasons. The 2011-12 team's sectional loss was to Sam Dekker and the Sheboygan Lutheran Crusaders. Sam went on to star for the Wisconsin Badgers and the Houston Rockets.\n\nDick Bennett, former basketball coach at the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay, University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Washington State University, began his basketball coaching career at Marion High School.\n\nMarion had no varsity football victories from the 1999 season finale until 2004. Marion won two games that year. Beginning in the 2009 season, the football team combined with Tigerton High School. The co-op team is known as the Marion-Tigerton Thundercatz.

Once the sale was approved by the FCC in April 1997, 3ABN immediately applied for a license for the station, which was granted June 20, 1997.\n\nIn April 1997, the FCC released its list of full-service digital television allotments, and K57GO found itself between allotments for KTBC-TV in Austin on UHF channel 56 and KMOL-TV (now WOAI-TV) in San Antonio on UHF channel 58, which increased the potential for interference on channel 57. In addition, the FCC wanted to move stations out of the 700 MHz band, which included stations on UHF channel 52 and above. K57GO applied to move to UHF channel 14 and also to upgrade its license to Class A in June 1998 and a permit was granted in March 2000. The station was licensed as Class A K14LM channel 14 on April 25, 2001.\n\nThe station was licensed for digital operation on May 28, 2015, moving operation to channel 27 and changing its call sign to the current K27LF-D.\n\n3ABN sold K27LF-D and 13 other stations to HC2 Holdings for $9.6 million in 2017.\n\n", "id": "7698572", "categories": ["Three Angels Broadcasting Network", "Television stations in Texas", "Television channels and stations established in 1994", "Religious television stations in the United States"], "title": "K27LF-D"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7698589", "text": "Rose Hill Drive\n\nRose Hill Drive is an American rock band. The group is often aligned with other bands that are reviving traditional hard rock and early metal–psychedelic. Combining hard-driving rock and blues with modern touches and arrangements, they are often described by reviewers as reminiscent of 1970s rock bands Led Zeppelin and Cream.\n\nRose Hill Drive was formed in 2000 in Boulder, Colorado by brothers Jacob Sproul (bass guitar and vocals) and Daniel Sproul (guitar, backup vocals), and high school friend Nathan Barnes (drums). The present trio solidified after the departure of bassist Graham Webster, who later wrote about the band. The band takes its name from the street where the Sproul brothers lived and the band's early rehearsals took place.\n\nRose Hill Drive has performed with Stone Temple Pilots, The Black Crowes, The Who, Robert Randolph, Wilco, Queens of the Stone Age, Van Halen, Gov't Mule, The Answer and Aerosmith and also performed at Graspop, Bonnaroo, Wakarusa, Red Rocks, Austin City Limits and the Warped Tour.\n\nOn August 22, 2006, the band released their debut self-titled album on Megaforce Records. That summer, the band played the same stage as The Who at the Wireless Festival in Leeds and the Hyde Park Calling Festival in London. In the fall of 2006 and spring of 2007, Rose Hill Drive supported The Who on select US and European dates. The band was joined on stage in Chicago at a taping of the show \"In The Attic\" by Pete Townshend, who jammed on The Who classic “Young Man Blues” and Rose Hill Drive's \"Raise Your Hands\". \n\nIn the April 2007 issue of \"Rolling Stone Magazine\", Rose Hill Drive was named one of the \"10 New Artists to Watch\" in 2007.\n\nThough influenced by many other blues and hard rock bands from the 1960s and 70s, the band reported in \"Rolling Stone\" that they are growing weary of being compared so closely to other bands, as they want to be known for their sound, not how much they sound like somebody else.\n\nTheir song \"Goal!\" is the official anthem for the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer.\n\nThe second album, Moon is the New Earth, was released on June 24, 2008, showing a blend of classic rock, punk-rock, psychedelia and even pop. The single \"Sneak Out\" appears in the popular video game \"Guitar Hero 5\", released on September 1, 2009.\n\nAfter a 17-months hiatus, the band resurrected in June 2010 to play a free concert in native Boulder, Colorado, with a revised line up: new member Jimmy Stofer is added on bass, while Jacob Sproul switched to rhythm guitar in order to let his brother Daniel concentrate on lead work. In an interview they said to having been writing new material, but without being in the rush to make a new album soon. \n\nThe band published two new songs on their Myspace.com web page in September 2010, named 'Setting Sun' and 'Mr Right'. In February 2011 Rose Hill Drive went into the studio and recorded a new album, and announced on their website a new US tour supporting Stone Temple Pilots through April and May. After a respite in June, Rose Hill Drive returns to touring in July 2011 with 15 more shows, opening for Stone Temple Pilots as well as headlining their own events.\n\nOn June 12, 2011, the band released their new album, titled \"Americana\", on their new self-founded label \"Slow and Shirley Records\", with two tracks published on Facebook to listen and download.\n\n\n", "id": "7698589", "categories": ["Indie rock musical groups from Colorado", "2003 establishments in Colorado", "Culture of Boulder, Colorado"], "title": "Rose Hill Drive"}

The existing house dates back to the 16th century, and perhaps even further back. It is built upon the site of the original dwelling mentioned in the Domesday Book.\n\nPrior to 1615, the manor was held by a succession of various owners. In 1615 it was sold to William Berkeley (1582–1658) of Cowleigh, eldest son of Rowland Berkeley (1548–1611) of Worcester and Spetchley, a wealthy Worcester clothier who originated from Hereford. The house then was a large, two-storey timber-framed dwelling with a third floor of gabled attics having carved bargeboards. The house contained a small, panelled room known as the 'sots hole' where drunks were held in order to sleep off their drunkenness. This room probably dates back to pre-15th century and before, when the house was a Court House. \n\nWilliam, Sheriff of Worcestershire in 1617 was succeeded by his son, Sir Rowland Berkeley (1613–1669). Sir Rowland's only son, Thomas, died unmarried, on 25 October 1669, in Greece. He was on a diplomatic mission to Turkey, travelling with His Excellency Sir Daniel Harvey from King Charles II to Sultan Mahomethan, Emperor of the Turks. The two men were travelling from Constantinople towards Thessalonica when Thomas fell ill. He was 30 years old and his remains were buried amongst Christians. Having no other sons, Cotheridge Court passed to Sir Rowland's eldest daughter Elizabeth. She married in 1681 Henry Green who adopted the surname Berkeley. Their eldest son became the next Rowland Berkeley of Cotheridge who died in 1731.\n\nIn 1770 the entrance front to the house, as well as the south front were cased with brick and the old windows were replaced with large, sash windows. The old, gabled attics were concealed behind a wall of brick; and sham, glazed windows were added to the new, brick front giving the appearance of a third floor without attics. The north wing of the house, as well as part of the back were not modernized, and remained as timber and plaster.\n\nIn 1764 another Rowland Berkeley (1732–1805) became Sheriff of Worcestershire and from May to September 1774 was Member of Parliament for Droitwich.\n\nIn the mid- or late 18th century a ha-ha was installed where the gardens met with the pastureland. This was to provide the house with a clean view of the grazing cattle and the breath-taking, prominent Malvern Hills in the far distance.\n\nRowland Berkeley (1732–1805), was succeeded by his brother the Rev. Henry Rowland Berkeley, D.C.L., Fellow of New College, Oxford, who also died childless in 1832. Eventually it passed to William Berkeley Esquire who died in 1869 and the manor passed to his eldest son the Rev. William Comyns Berkeley. His son Rowland, eldest brother to Herbert Bowyer Berkeley inherited the manor. \n\nAt about the mid-part of the century a delicate, ornamental stone balustrade was added to the top of the brick facing, above the sham, glazed windows.\n\nIt is mentioned in John Noake's \"History of Worcestershire\" that from the road to Bromyard an avenue of limes some three-quarters of a mile in length, and in a straight line runs from the road to Cotheridge Court.\n\n\n", "id": "7698624", "categories": ["Grade II* listed buildings in Worcestershire", "Country houses in Worcestershire"], "title": "Cotheridge Court"}

His father ran a print shop and Folds learned how to set type at a young age. A fire at his father's printing plant forced the family into bankruptcy and they immigrated to the United States. Landing in Boston on September 19, 1845, Folds sought to make his living in America as an actor.\n\nHe made his way to New York City and worked for Horace Greeley as a reporter and typesetter for the \"New York Tribune\". Because of Greeley's dislike of the theater, Folds adopted the Langrishe stage name, taking the surname from that of a judge and policeman that he knew in Ireland.\n\nLangrishe was known to appear on stage at least once in his native Ireland, but made his New York acting debut on December 8, 1845 at the Chatham Theater in a play called \"The Irish Attorney\" as a character named Pierce O'Hara.\n\nIn 1847 he left New York City to become a full-time actor, comedian and magician. Two years later in 1849 he married fellow actor Jeannette Allen in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, both performed in J.H. Howell's Theatre company in Erie, Pennsylvania. By 1850 Langrishe was performing with his own troupe known as \"Langrishe and Company\" throughout New York, Ohio and southeastern Canada.\n\nLangrishe and Company travelled westward in 1851, crossing Lake Michigan to play in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Performances followed in Chicago, Illinois and Kansas City, Missouri; his troupe continued to draw favorable reviews in the Midwest as late as 1859 until the troupe began running out of money due to salaries and extensive wardrobes.\n\nArriving in Central City, Colorado in 1860, Langrishe and Company performed to sold out shows in mining towns as opposed to established cities.\n\nAfter close to a decade of performing in Colorado, the Langrishes made their way to Helena, Montana in 1870 where they built the Langrishe Opera House.\n\nThe post-Civil War years showed a marked change in theatrical tastes of the West. Dramas were forsaken for minstrel shows and burlesque. Langrishe began to lose his fortune and modified his shows to suit the tastes of his audience. The company took to the road after the Langrishe Opera House burned down in 1874.\n\nLangrishe arrived with his wife Jeannette and their Company in Deadwood, South Dakota on July 15, 1876 and their first performance was held at The Bella Union. Langrishe along with treasurer and troupe manager Jonas Hellawell, leased the McDaniels Theatre July 22, 1876 from Cheyenne, Wyoming theatre manager James McDaniels, who constructed the first theatre in Deadwood.\n\nThe Langrishe Theatre’s first production was \"Trodden Down\" on July 29, 1876. The Langrishe Theatre provided facilities for the Jack McCall murder trial, the man accused in the death of Wild Bill Hickok, the first marriage to be performed in Deadwood August 26, 1876, George Morgan to L. McKelvey by Judge Kuykendall, and as a meeting place for the secret society, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. General George Crook and his officers would attend a performance at the Langrishe Theatre September 23, 1876 while visiting Deadwood.\n\nLangrishe was an integral player in shaping Deadwood’s early history as he participated in civic endeavors such as Fourth of July event planning and fund raising for health charities. The Langrishe Company’s benefit performance October 14, 1876 donated receipts totaling over $73 to Deadwood’s hospital kitty.\n\nCalamity Jane would appear at the Langrishe Theatre in 1876 along with noted attractions such as Jenny Lind Burlesque. Legitimate Deadwood actors and actresses, Fanny B. Price, Augusta Chambers, Belle Gilbert, Jim Gilbert, Frank Perkins, Jimmy J.M. Martin, W. J. Gross, Viola Porter, J.P. Clark and Emma Whittle performed nightly to packed houses while other forms of Deadwood entertainment and amusement drew equally large variety audiences at the Gem and Bella Union Theatres where Negro Minstrels, Clog Dancers, Acrobats, Child Contortionists, Double Trapeze, Brass Bands and Serio-comic Song and Character Sketch Artists Charles Vincent and Georgie Morrell Vincent were at the top of the bill.\n\nLangrishe leased and remodeled the Tremont House in Deadwood May 1879 and built new opera houses in the nearby mining towns of Central City and Lead, two and ten miles up Deadwood Gulch. On Langrishe Theatre opening night May 9, 1878, choice seats sold for $25 and theatre goers were tempted to sample strawberries and ice cream after the performance.\n\nThe Langrishe Theatre building would be rented to Impresario Johnny Rogers and The Metropolitan Company where legitimate theatre continued to be a successful choice of entertainment for an evolving Deadwood audience. The Old Langrishe Theatre building would continue to serve as a theatre and as a church for Congregationalist services until its final demise in the Big Deadwood Fire of September 26, 1879.\n\nMany Deadwood miners and businessmen relocated to Leadville, Colorado in January 1879 to follow the promise of the new rush and the next big strike. Jack Langrishe and Company would once again take the stage with fellow Deadwood manager Billy Nuttall’s Bella Union Theatre Company who opened the new Leadville Grand Central Theatre. Al Swearengen and the Gem Theater troupe visited Leadville February 1879, but chose to return to Deadwood. The Langrishe Troupe continued to perform to audiences in Deadwood, Central, Lead and to the soldiers at Ft. Meade through the summer of 1879. The Jack Langrishe Company’s final performance to a Deadwood audience would be \"Our American Cousin\" August 15, 1879 performed by troupe artists The Gilberts.\n\nJack and Jeannette Langrishe opened November 23, 1879 at the Tabor Opera House operated by Colorado Silver Baron Horace Austin Warner Tabor and Baby Doe Tabor, Leadville, Colorado. Popular Langrishe actor Jimmy Martin would join with fellow Gem and Bella Union Theatre artists Flora Belle and Fannie Garretson to open at Leadville’s McDaniels Theatre May 1880.\n\nLangrishe retired from the stage in 1885 and moved to Idaho where he served as a Justice of the Peace and occasional playwright in Coeur d'Alene. In 1890 he was elected to the State Senate as a republican in the first State Legislature of Idaho and served on committees which chose the state's flag, state seal and two senators for the US Senate. In 1892 he returned to his roots as a newsman publishing \"The Wardner News\" in Wardner, Idaho.\n\nAfter a brief illness he died in 1895 in Wardner, Idaho on December 12, 1895. His grave is located in Kellogg, Idaho.\n\nLangrishe was portrayed by Brian Cox in the third season of the HBO television series \"Deadwood\".\n\n", "id": "7698650", "categories": ["People from County Dublin", "American male stage actors", "People of the American Old West", "1895 deaths", "American theatre managers and producers", "Idaho state senators"], "title": "Jack Langrishe"}

Completed in 1839, the house is a distinctive example of transitional Greek Revival and Italianate architecture, and is nationally significant for the extremely well-preserved drawings on its interior walls. The site was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009. The house presently serves as the Davison Arts Center of Wesleyan University.\n\nThis stately mansion faces east towards the Connecticut River from the west side of High Street opposite the intersection of Court Street. It is set back from the street atop a rise. A high iron fence borders the property along High Street. This house makes an important contribution to the elegance and high style which characterized High Street as the preferred residential area in nineteenth-century Middletown.\n\nThe Alsop house was built in 1838–1839 by Richard Alsop IV for his twice-widowed mother, Mrs. Maria (Alsop) Dana. The short-lived architectural firm formed by Landra Beach Platt and Francis Benne who worked together in New Haven under the tutelage of Sidney Mason Stone was evidently responsible for the design, although it is possible that they drew their inspiration from Ithiel Town's own home in New Haven, which may account for the similarities of the two structures as well as for a former attribution of the Alsop House to Town himself. (Stone's possible contributions have yet to be explored.) The well-known Middletown builders, Barzillai Sage and Isaac W. Baldwin, performed the masonry and carpentry work, respectively. The house remained in the hands of Alsop family until its acquisition in 1948 by Wesleyan University.\n\nThis house is significant architecturally for its transitional Greek-Tuscan Italianate appearance. The cubical, two-story, central block with overhanging eaves is flanked by colonnaded -story wings. A swag-and-tassel design decorates the frieze of the central block, which also displays a veranda supported by delicate ironwork and surmounted by an intricate balustrade.\n\nA rear colonnaded wing which originally housed servant's quarters and service facility has been enclosed. At the west end of this wing are attached an art gallery of recent construction and the art library, originally the stable.\n\nThe interior of the Alsop house is noted for its decorative wall paintings. The stair hall displays trompe l'oeil painting of figures in niches, while the parlors, dining room and morning-room feature oil-on-plaster paintings. The parlor paintings are classically derived and some subjects are Raphaelesque in origin. In the morning room the formal classicism of the parlors is replaced by scenes derived from the \"rural\" Italian tradition of wall decoration. Local birds and insects are featured in these scenes. The dining room displays a painted frieze. The paintings are believed to have been executed by German or Italian immigrants. Possible contributors include the noted Italian artist Nicola Monachesi. According to family documentation, the paintings were executed between 1839 and 1860.\n\nThe main rooms of the house are furnished with period antiques and provide a suitable atmosphere in which to display the wall painting. In its carefully restored condition, the Alsop house remains a monument to the skill of its designers, while serving Wesleyan University and the community as an art center.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7698663", "categories": ["Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut", "National Historic Landmarks in Connecticut", "Landmarks in Connecticut", "National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Connecticut", "Houses in Middletown, Connecticut", "Historic American Buildings Survey in Connecticut"], "title": "Richard Alsop IV House"}

Ettore Annunziata, developed by Zono and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn in 1996. The soundtrack to \"Mr. Bones\" was composed and performed by Ronnie Montrose, with cutscenes and art assets done by Angel Studios.\n\nDaGoulian, a mad philosopher who believes that one can only \"ensure the survival of good by making evil thrive\", sets out to purify the world with evil. By playing a special set of drums powered by science and alchemy, he is able to tap into a primal power which he calls \"skeletal magnetism\" (or \"skeletism\") and summon the dead from their graves as his skeletal soldiers.\n\nOne inmate of the cemetery, however, is pure of heart and is thus resurrected not with red (evil) skeletism, but with blue (good) skeletism. Because of this, he retains his free will. This fact is quickly noticed by DaGoulian, and he orders his newly created army to destroy this rebel, who calls himself simply \"Mr. Bones.\"\n\nMr. Bones soon becomes determined to stop DaGoulian's plan. He must find a way to counteract the evil of red skeletism before DaGoulian's minions catch up to him.\n\nOne of \"Mr. Bones\"' most distinctive qualities is in it having very few levels which share the same style of gameplay; with only a few exceptions, almost every level looks and feels different from the rest. Some levels simply change the camera perspective, while others offer up their own distinct genre. The most common thread running throughout the game is that of an action/platform game with slight gameplay and viewing angle variations per level, but at times the styles diverge far more drastically, ranging from a music/rhythm game to a \"Breakout\"-style game to a game of memorization. Once a level has been beaten, the player can return directly to that level from the main menu any time they choose.\n\nIn lieu of a normal health bar, Mr. Bones has a supply of skeletism. When his skeletism level drops, he gradually loses body parts, being reduced to just a skull and spine at his lowest levels. His lost body parts remain in play and can be reattached, though unless Mr. Bones regains skeletism the reattachment will be fragile and even landing from a significant height will cause the parts to fall off again. The game's physics also take Mr. Bones' state of completion into account; for example, if he has lost both legs he will crawl with his arms, and cannot run or jump. In most levels, Mr. Bones can shoot a beam from his hand which destroys enemies and restores his skeletism level. He can also restore skeletism by collecting blue items.\n\nThe cinematics were designed and directed by Allen Battino, who also performed the role of Mr. Bones via motion capture.\n\nA playable demo of \"Mr. Bones\" was exhibited at the May 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo.\n\nThe music was composed by musician Ronnie Montrose. This was part of a larger trend of established musicians in the late 1990's who composed music for video games, with other examples being Ian McDonald composing for \"Wachenröder\" and Stewart Copeland composing music for \"Spyro the Dragon\".\n\n\"Mr. Bones\" polarized reviewers, who sharply disagreed on whether the gameplay was bizarre and extraordinarily original, or mundane \"hop n bop\" platforming. \"GameSpot\"s Tom Ham gave it a modest score but a relentlessly positive review, applauding the unique stage designs, varying perspectives, titular character, beautiful and eerie visual design, and blues-rock soundtrack. He summarized the game as \"a cool, musically interactive, multi-level scroller that's surprisingly fun to play.\" The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" were also enthralled, with Dan Hsu summarizing, \"\"Mr. Bones\" is completely unique - you can tell that some true geniuses worked on this project.\" Most of them commented that the different gameplay types in the many levels are consistently ingenious and fun, though Sushi-X said the gameplay is weak, and that it is the humorous and audio-visually stunning full-motion video cutscenes which make the game enjoyable. In contrast, Scary Larry of \"GamePro\" completely panned the game, citing \"unfinished graphics\", unfairly difficult enemy AI, and \"insipid hop-n-bop gameplay.\" He said the music is a positive point, but the spoken word background in \"Glass Shards\" is annoying. A \"Next Generation\" critic commented that the concept of the game is refreshingly unusual but that most of the levels use \"fairly average\" side-scrolling gameplay which does not live up to the originality of the concept. He still concluded the game to be moderately appealing due to its humor and especially its massive length. Lee Nutter of the British \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" said that, due in part to its much delayed PAL conversion, \"Mr. Bones\" was outdated by the time of its release in the UK. He contended that the different gameplay types just make the game feel like a generic platformer with a lot of out-of-place mini-games. However, his main criticism was that the game is too distinctively American.\n", "id": "7698684", "categories": ["Video games developed in the United States", "Fictional skeletons", "Action video games", "Sega Saturn games", "1996 video games", "Sega Saturn-only games", "Skeleton video games", "Video games with 2.5D graphics", "Side-scrolling video games", "Single-player video games"], "title": "Mr. Bones (video game)"}

After her mother's death in 1807, she frequently stayed with her uncle Charles at Eastbourne.\n\nOn 18 April 1808, she married Davies Giddy, a Cornish landowner, who had served as High Sheriff of the Duchy. He was an M.P. for Cornish constituencies from 1806 to 1832. Among his roles in Parliament was as Chairman of the Board of Agriculture. Mary Ann Gilbert was passionately concerned about low agricultural productivity and the plight of the rural poor. Davies was more interested in how the Parish Rate for the support of unemployed might be reduced.\n\nDavies Giddy was also a professional applied mathematician and became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and, for an unhappy period, its President.\n\nIn 1814, Mary Ann Gilbert's uncle, Charles Gilbert, died. In his Will, he left her much property in Sussex, or to a future husband, if he changed his name to \"Gilbert\".\n\nIn December 1817 Davies Giddy took his wife's surname, \"Gilbert\", to perpetuate it. In January 1818, the names of their children were also changed.\n\nSharing her husband's interest, Mary Ann Gilbert managed some successful practical agronomical experiments at Beachy Head in feeding the poor, or rather, teaching them to feed themselves using land no-one else wanted, for a fair rent. She presented the statistical results of these works to her husband's political, scientific and \"County\" contacts.

Founded in 1947, it is a national academic centre of excellence, serving the legal community and universities across the United Kingdom and the world through legal scholarship, facilities, and its comparative law library.\n\nThe mission of the Institute is to be \"the focal point of legal research for the United Kingdom and the countries of the British Commonwealth.\" \n\nSince 1976, the Institute’s home has been Charles Clore House, located in the heart of Bloomsbury, at 17 Russell Square.\n\nThe Institute of Advanced Legal Studies was established in 1947 in response to recommendations made in 1932 by Lord Atkin that the United Kingdom needed an institution \"which would be a headquarters for academic research and would promote the advancement of knowledge of the law in the most general terms.\" On 11 June 1948, the Institute was officially opened by the Lord Chancellor, William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt. The first director was Professor Sir David Hughes Parry, a distinguished Professor of English Law at the London School of Economics and for many years Vice-Chancellor of the University of London. The Librarian, K. Howard Drake also acted as administrative secretary for the Institute.\n\nHoused at 25 Russell Square, the Institute occupied all floors of the building, the ground and first floors reserved for the library with rooms on the second and third converted into offices or study/seminar rooms. The library held 11,000 books in its first year, a substantial number donated by Dr. Charles Huberich. An internal telephone system connected all the rooms with a hand book lift installed to move books from floor to floor.\n\nBy 1949, the Institute was running out of space and were given permission to extend into the basement and ground floor 26 Russell Square. Here it remained until 1976 when the Institute moved into No. 17 Russell Square, part of the newly built Charles Clore House designed by Sir Denys Lasdun. At the official opening on 1st April 1976, the then Chancellor of the University of London, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, overstayed and her official schedule had to be abandoned.\n\nIn 1994, the IALS became a member of the School of Advanced Study. The Institute is also home to the British Institute of International and Comparative Law.\n\nA five-year refurbishment of Charles Clore House is currently underway, the first phase of which was completed in September 2012, incorporating a larger café and improved lecture facilities on the ground floor.\n\nThe IALS library holds a collection of over 300,000 legal texts, complemented by over 3,000 current serial titles, reports, and legislative materials. It has been described as the \"jewel in the Institute’s crown\", and is a repository library for legal texts published in the United Kingdom. The library covers five floors of Charles Clore House with the library entrance on the fourth floor. The library catalogue forms part of a shared catalogue with its fellow School of Advanced Study institutes and that of Senate House Library.\n\nThe Institute library is considered one of the world’s leading comparative research libraries, holding significant material not otherwise available in the United Kingdom. Jurisdictions covered include countries in, North America, Latin America, Europe (including the European Union) and the Commonwealth. The library is particularly strong in Public International Law. It has a large collection of United States Federal resources and holdings of State primary resources, focused on California, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Louisiana. Postgraduate law students of the University of London colleges, including University College London, London School of Economics and Political Science, King's College London, and Queen Mary, University of London rely exclusively on the Institute's research holdings for coursework.\n\nSince the late 1990s, IALS has participated in collaborative and standalone digital projects resulting in a number of searchable databases publicly available via the website. These include FLAG (Foreign Law Guides), FIT (Flare Index to Treaties), and Eagle-I, which builds upon the original Jisc funded Intute: Law project (formerly SOSIG Law).\n\nThe IALS library has partnered with other libraries and organisations in promotions and projects to highlight legal research. The library concentrates on printed and digital resources, often as lead developer for web-based initiatives. Ongoing collaborations with the British Library and BAILII have led to increased web presence for legal research, with IALS hosting BAILII and supporting its role in providing free access to full text British and Irish legal materials. The Concordat with the British Library is a collaboration to map existing holdings in foreign legal materials in both libraries and collate information to form a national collection of foreign official gazettes. Recently the library became a charter member of LLCM-Digital, a US-based consortium of libraries dedicated to the preservation of legal documentation for dissemination via a searchable online database.\n\nThe Institute actively promotes research by its own academic staff and students in conjunction with its role as a national legal research centre. Research centres at the Institute contribute to legal research via externally funded projects or study, with the Sir William Dale Centre, and Woolf Chair of Legal Education at the fore. Areas of research conducted by the Institute include legislative drafting, human rights, international financial regulation, and transnational taxation law. Notable recent works by Institute faculty includes \"Thornton's Legislative Drafting, Fifth Edition\", by Professor Helen Xanthaki, and \"Foundations and Future of Financial Regulation\" and \"European Comparative Company Law\" by Professor Mads Andenas.\n\nThrough its association with the School of Advanced Study, the Institute offers a number of fellowships for legal research to both national and international legal academics and practitioners. Fellows give lectures in their field of expertise during their tenure.\n\nThere are over 70 Ph.D./M.Phil. students studying at the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, in addition to postgraduate law students registered for LL.M. and M.A. degrees. Currently, the Institute offers three programmes of study: LL.M. in Advanced Legislative Studies, LL.M. in International Corporate Governance, Financial Regulation, and Economic Law, as well as the LL.M. in legal translation (Jointly with the Institute of Modern Language Research).\n\nThe LL.M. in Advanced Legislative Studies, which the institute claims is \"prized by governments around the world as the flagship degree in the subject,\" trains lawyers from across the common law world in the art of statutory drafting, law reform, and the legislative process. The programme emphasizes a \"blend of academic and practitioner concerns in [an] area of critical constitutional importance.\" \n\nDuring the summer term, short courses are available on a variety of relevant topics. Courses include the Sir William Dale Centre Course in Legislative Drafting and the Certificate in International Commercial Arbitration. \n\nIn 2013, the peer-reviewed \"IALS Student Law Review\" was founded, offering both Master's and Ph.D. students the opportunity to publish original research and manage a scholarly journal.\n\nThe Institute has one main lecture theatre complemented by a number of smaller lecture/seminar rooms. Each year, it arranges workshops and lectures for academics and practitioners. Two annual conferences hosted by the IALS are the W. G. Hart Workshop and the Hamlyn Lectures series.\n\nThe Institute maintains exchange programmes with foreign legal institutions. A partnership with the Beijing Arbitration Commission, established in 2012, seeks to promote the study of alternative dispute resolution, and deepen Sino-British legal relationships. The IALS has also begun an exchange programme with judges from the Brazilian State of Pernambuco and the School of Advanced Judicial Studies of Pernambuco. This program focuses on comparative common law/civil law features and law reform consequences.\n\n", "id": "7698767", "categories": ["Legal research", "Law schools in England", "Educational institutions established in 1947", "School of Advanced Study"], "title": "Institute of Advanced Legal Studies"}

Outside of the services, health, and retail sectors, major employers are in high technology and defense, with a still-shrinking manufacturing sector.\n\nSuburban sprawl and serious economic hardships have reduced the role Lowell plays in its suburbs over the decades. The entire region is often considered a component of the much larger Greater Boston area, as Lowell is only 25 miles from downtown Boston. Suburban office parks, shopping malls, and the severe decline of heavy industry in New England have pulled the economic focus away from the once great industrial and commercial base in Lowell itself.

This approach to growth management is unique among states. The act (Chapter 36.70A RCW) was adopted by the Legislature in 1990.\n\nThe GMA was adopted because the Washington State Legislature found that uncoordinated and unplanned growth posed a threat to the environment, sustainable economic development and the quality of life in Washington.\n\nRather than centralize planning and decision-making at the state level, the GMA focuses on local control. The GMA establishes state goals, sets deadlines for compliance, offers direction on how to prepare local comprehensive plans and regulations and sets forth requirements for early and continuous public participation. Within the framework provided by the mandates of the Act, local governments have many choices regarding the specific content of comprehensive plans and implementing development regulations.\n\nThe Growth Management Hearings Board hears and determines allegations that a government agency has not complied with the GMA or the related Shoreline Management Act (SMA, Chapter 90.58 RCW). A 1991 law amended the GMA to create three regional boards, but a 2010 law consolidated them into one. SMA jurisdiction was added in 1996.

It was released on May 30, 2005 by Massacre Records. It was generally well-received both popularly and critically; for instance, it was voted to be in the top 20 albums of 2005 by the users of the Metal Storm webzine.\n\nAfter its re-formation in 2001, Timeless Miracle, then known as Trapped, was composed of only two members, Mikael Holst and Fredrik Nilsson, who considered the band to be merely a hobby, but decided to record three demos in 2002–2004 using a drum machine. In 2004, the band was approached by a record label with an offer of a contract. In 2005, after the line-up was completed by the drummer Jaime Salazar and the guitarist Sten Möller, Timeless Miracle began recording their début album, mainly composed of tracks that first appeared on the demos.\n\n\"Into the Enchanted Chamber\" is a melodies-driven album with prominent keyboards, influenced by the classical and folk music. The lyrics, dealing with the supernatural themes, are greatly inspired by the old horror movies, such as \"The Wolf Man\" and \"Curse of the Devil\", as well as by the medieval Nordic folklore and create a dark atmosphere, in contrast to the much more joyous-sounding music. The songs with the strong folkloric influences include \"Witches of Black Magic\", which is inspired by the legends of Blockula and \"Return of the Werewolf\", featuring Little Red Riding Hood. The title track explores the theme of a religious cult, which drives its followers to mass suicide. The ballad \"Memories\" is the only track not to appear on the demos, having been written long prior. Over 14 minutes long, \"The Voyage\" is the longest and the most diverse track of the album; it took almost six months to compose and arrange.\n\n", "id": "7698898", "categories": ["2005 debut albums"], "title": "Into the Enchanted Chamber"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7698940", "text": "Černová massacre\n\nThe Černová massacre (or Černová tragedy, , or Csernova Affair) was a shooting that happened in Csernova, Kingdom of Hungary (today Černová, part of Ružomberok, Slovakia) on 27 October 1907 in which 15 people were killed and many were wounded after gendarmes fired into a crowd of people gathering for the consecration of the local Catholic church. The shootings sparked protests in European and American press and turned world's attention to the treatment of minorities in the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary.\n\nOn the initiative of Andrej Hlinka, the Slovak parish priest of nearby Ružomberok and a native of Černová, people of Černová decided to raise money for the construction of a new church. The locals raised 80,000 crowns and the collections received minor donations from the Slovak Americans as well. The construction started in April 1907 and by the autumn, the church was ready for consecration. \n\nThe locals wanted the church to be consecrated by Hlinka, however, he was at the time suspended by bishop Sándor Párvy and sentenced to two years of imprisonment due to his pro-Slovak agitation during the election campaign of 1906 and the subsequent conviction of incitement. The people of Černová thus demanded the consecration to be postponed until Hlinka would be able to perform the ceremony. The bishopric denied their request and two Magyar speaking priests were appointed in his stead. First Canon Anton Kurimsky and after his refusal, Dean Martin Pazurik of Likavka.\n\nThe ceremony was to take place on 27 October 1907. The official procession arrived at the village accompanied by a squad of 15 gendarmes. It was protested against by the locals, who attempted to block its way to the church to prevent Pazurik from consecrating. The demonstration was peaceful in nature although some accounts report stone-throwing at a member of the gendarme escort. In panic the gendarme leader sergeant Ján Ladiczky, an ethnic Slovak, ordered his squad to open fire into the crowd without prior warning killing 15 of the protesting villagers, seriously wounding 12 and lightly injuring 40.\n\nAccording to historian Roman Holec, the majority of the members of the Hungarian gendarmes involved in the shooting were of Slovak origin.\n\nMany attempted to capitalize politically on the events, Czech and Slovak nationalists in general, and Hlinka in particular. On the one hand, Hlinka's appeal against his 1906 verdict was rejected, thus, on 30 November 1907 Hlinka started to serve his jail term in the Csillagbörtön (\"Star Prison\"), Szeged. On the other hand, Hlinka appealed with success his suspension to the Holy See, so it was cancelled on 8 April 1909. When Hlinka left the prison, Bishop Párvy appointed him again to his Ružomberok parish, and Hlinka consecrated the church in Černová with Párvy's consent.\n\nThe tragedy sparked protests in the European and US press and it turned the world's attention to the attitude to the minorities in Hungary. Important protesting European personalities included the Norwegian Nobel Prize holder Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, the Oxford historian Robert William Seton-Watson, and the speaker of the Austrian parliament.\n\nToday's Slovak politicians — especially the members of the Slovak National Party — even though all perpetrators were Slovaks, interpret the event as \"Hungarian gendarmes shooting at innocent Slovaks\" (during the legal actions after the massacre, some gendarmes refused to testify as witnesses, because the victims were their relatives). With many of their claims regarding the events, the Slovak National Party continues to perpetuate a \"false myth of Černová\". Some Slovak sources claim that the gendarmes were ethnic Hungarian. even though there was a very small number of ethnic Hungarians in the region where the gendarmes were recruited. According to Slovak historian Roman Holec, professor at Comenius University in Bratislava, the majority of the gendarmes were Slovaks from Liptó county. (According to the official 1910 census, over 90% of the population were ethnic Slovaks in that county.) They were nevertheless honored for the deed, because they were in the service of Hungarian state. Both the rioters and the gendarmes can be held responsible for the massacre. The rioters were violent from lack of fear of getting shot (i.e. that the sergeant would refrain from giving an order of fire or use blanks). The gendarmes were shooting in all directions instead of aiming for feet or into the air (most victims died due to their head and chest injuries).\n\n\n", "id": "7698940", "categories": ["History of Austria-Hungary", "Massacres in Slovakia", "Mass murder in 1907", "Ružomberok"], "title": "Černová massacre"}

The school is considered elite among Turkish public high schools. Germany recognizes the school as a \"Deutsche Auslandsschule\" (German International school).\n\nİstanbul Lisesi is located in Cağaloğlu, İstanbul. The school has changed several buildings throughout its history. Since 1933 the school has used its current building. The building was designed by architects Alexander Vallaury and Raimondo D'Aronco and inaugurated in 1882 as the \"Düyun-u Umumiye\" (Council of Ottoman Revenues and Debts Administration) Building, which overlooks the entrance to the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn. A new building adjacent to the main historical building was inaugurated in 1984, providing new boarding and sports facilities. The primary languages of instruction are Turkish and German. The secondary foreign language of instruction is English.\n\nAs a state school, admissions to İstanbul Lisesi are through the Secondary Education Institutions Entrance Exams (OKS), the central state school examination. İstanbul Lisesi is one of the most difficult schools to enter of all the 400 \"Anadolu Lisesi\"s (special state secondary schools) in the country. Admission to the İstanbul Lisesi requires a tough competition, since only 180 students out of 1,400,000 applicants can make it through every year, and İstanbul Lisesi is usually among the first choices of best ranked students along with Galatasaray High School and leading \"Fen Lisesi\"s (Science high school). The school usually accepts students from the top 800-1000 in Turkey.\n\nThe school offers a tuition-free, high level education, providing voluntary boarding possibilities, and as such, draws a diverse group of students from all over Turkey, including students who cannot afford private education. The academic program enables students to pursue academic excellence and acquire fluency and literacy in German and Turkish.\n\nİstanbul Lisesi is the first Turkish school\n\nThe education period is five years (one year German preparatory, and four year high school). The German Abitur has been offered at İstanbul Lisesi since 2002. The Abitur diploma permits successful students the admission to any German university in almost any faculty. All science and mathematics courses in the last two years are at Abitur level. İstanbul Lisesi has a very strong academic record, with a high proportion of its students proceeding to prominent universities in Turkey, Germany, Austria and the United States.\n\nThe school combines both German and Turkish curricula. Mathematics, geometry, chemistry, physics, biology, computer science and German classes are instructed in German, while history, geography, civic education, military sciences, religion, philosophy, literature, physical education, art and music are taught in Turkish. Textbooks, curricula and standards are under the permanent supervision of the German government. German and English are the compulsory foreign languages taught at İstanbul Lisesi.\n\nSince 1999 İstanbul Lisesi has been a 5-year school. All students are required to spend their first year learning to master the German language, taking twenty-three hours of instruction in their first year and eighteen hours in their second year. Science, mathematics and English courses also start in the preparatory class. Biology is the first science class followed by physics and chemistry in the ninth and tenth grades (second and third years, respectively).\n\nIn the eleventh grade the students choose between two majors: Mathematics and Sciences (FEN), or Turkish and Mathematics (TM). Students who aim to pursue careers in engineering, sciences or medicine, major in FEN, concentrating on science and mathematics courses. TM major is dominated by courses in social sciences and mathematics and is for students who want to study humanities, business, economics or social sciences.\n\nThe academic standards are demanding, and the grading system is strict. As the school follows both German and Turkish curricula, two evaluation scales are used. The grade equivalents in the Turkish evaluation are:\n\nA GPA of 2.0 is a passing grade, 3.5 is honors, 4.5 is high honors.\nIn the German Department student grades are evaluated on a 15 scale:\n\nMehmet Nadir Bey, a retired Captain of the Navy, a prominent mathematician and teacher, together with Selanikli Abdi Kamil Efendi, a school principal, founded in 1882 the first private school in İstanbul, the \"Şems’ül Maarif\" (The Sun of Education), but for unknown reasons the partnership did not last long.\n\nMehmet Nadir Bey established his own private school Numune-i Terakki (The Example of Progress) in 1884, which would be the foundation of İstanbul Lisesi. At the beginning, the school provided primary and middle school education for boys, but would soon add high school classes, and also start accepting girls. In an interview to a newspaper in 1891, Mehmet Nadir Bey would express his pride to have established the first private high school in Turkey. The school would not only attract many students in a short time (the number of students would reach 600 in 1891, of which 150 were boarding students), but also catch the attention of the Ministry of Education, and of the Sultan himself.\n\nAfter the detection of some teachers’ involvement in an unsuccessful coup to overthrow Abdülhamid II, the school was purchased by the Ministry of Education in 1896, which changed its name to Terakki İdadisi (Progress High School). From 1896 to 1908, the school became a day school, changed several buildings, and according to the facilities occupied, varied in size and number of students. Following the move to a larger building and the legislation combining the 4-year primary school and 3-year middle school into a 5-year education, the school was able to provide boarding again in 1908, and the name of the school was changed to İstanbul Leyli İdadisi (Istanbul Boarding High School) in 1909.\n\nIn 1910, the school started to use the word \"Lise\" (Lyceum), a first in a Turkish school. İstanbul Lisesi was a 5-year boarding school charging tuition, and was admitting students following an examination. The physical education teacher of the school, Abdurrahman Roberson, established İstanbulspor and a boy scout group in 1912. The scout group, later named Sakarya in honor of the Turkish victory in Battle of Sakarya, is still active to this day. Also in 1912, during the First Balkan War, about 30 students volunteered for the defense of the capital against the advancing Bulgarian army.\n\nThe school name was changed to İstanbul Sultanisi (Istanbul High School) in 1913. Following the closing of the foreign schools in İstanbul due to the beginning of the First World War, İstanbul Sultanisi was moved to the buildings of the Saint Benoit High School, and some parts of the buildings were changed to dormitories. The faculty was supported with the addition of prominent teachers, and the student populace exceeded 1600. Subsequent to the increased collaboration between the German and Ottoman Empires, 22 German teachers were sent by the German Ministry to the school, and the curriculum was changed to German. The curriculum was similar to Galatasaray High School, only the foreign language was German instead of French. The students would take 14 hours of weekly lessons in German, and the same lectures again in Turkish, except history and literature, which were taught only in Turkish.\n\nThe Armistice of Mudros, the subsequent occupation of İstanbul, and the incompetence of the government in İstanbul had important effects on the school. As the school was given only 2 days to evacuate the building by the commander of the occupying forces, most of the valuable library and the educational material had to be left behind. The school was not able to find a suitable building for a long time, and some students continued their education in different buildings, sometimes in different schools. Nonetheless, the faculty was still very strong and many of the teachers, such as Hasan Ali Yücel, Mazhar Nedim, Memduh Şevket Esendal, would become the prominent figures and/or leaders that contributed to the shaping of the society, ideological basis, and the governance of the Republic of Turkey. Some of the students and many alumni would join Atatürk in his struggle for independence at very early stages, and some would lose their lives during the battles.\n\nWith the declaration of the Republic, the school moved to the Fuat Paşa Mansion in Beyazıt and its name was changed to İstanbul Erkek Lisesi (Istanbul Boys' High School) in 1923. On Atatürk’s instructions, the school moved to the building of the former \"Düyun-u Umumiye (Council of Ottoman Revenues and Debts Administration)\" in 1933. During the Second World War the German education was suspended in 1942. Curriculum in German was introduced again in 1958 with the Bilateral Collaboration Agreement on Culture and Education between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Turkey. Last students of the regular high school curriculum would graduate in 1962, and the school started to admit girls in 1962, although the boarding was only provided to boys. The school remained a 7-year secondary school (1 year of preparatory, 3 years of middle school, and 3 years of high school).\n\nThe status of the high school was changed to Anadolu Lisesi, and the name was changed back to İstanbul Lisesi in 1982. In 1988 it gained a special status offering 2 year preparatory, 3 years of middle school, and 3 years of high school education. With the legislation on the extension of the compulsory primary school education from 5 years to 8 years in 2003, the education period was changed to 1 year German Preparatory and 4 year high school.\n\n\nIn 1914 the buildings of Saint Benoit High School were assigned to the İstanbul Sultanisi. With the beginning of the First World War, some parts of the buildings were converted into a hospital, and as an indication, the building was painted yellow as a sign of hope.\n\nWhen all the 50 volunteered senior students fell during the Battle of Gallipoli at Kabatepe, on May 19, 1915 at 3:30 am, the remaining students painted all the windows and the doors of the school in black \"in memoriam\".\n\nThe first school emblem was designed in around 1915/1916. It incorporates the first letters of İstanbul Sultanisi, elif and sin in Arabic, a rose, the star, and the crescent. It was modified by the Turkish sculptor Nejat Sirel (IS '07) in 1917. Sirel's design did not include the rose, whose symbolic meaning, if any, is still unclear.\n\nThe final form of the school emblem was designed by Orhan Omay (İEL '37) and has been in use since 1970.\n\n\n\nThe Scouting Group of Sakarya is the oldest Scouting Group of Turkey, which was started in 1912 by the PE teacher Abdurrahman Robenson. At the same time the scouting group of Galatasaray was started by his brother Ahmet Robenson.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Chess Festival is held every year since 2001. It starts when the guests arrive and ends after the winners get their prizes. Around 60 schools from both Turkey and other countries, take part each year. The 13th Chesstival will be held in April 2013.\n\nAt the end of each academic year, the students and alumni engage in cultural activities, including concerts, discussions with alumni and leading people from art and science circles.\n\nIstanbul Erkek Lisesi Model United Nations is a conference by IELMUN Club, in Istanbul, Turkey. Even being a High school MUN Conference, is the world's first and only Model United Nations Conference with three languages English, German and Turkish and also first MUN Conference in German, out of Germany. Because of being a German foreign high school and its other international relations with tens of universities and high schools, hundreds of university and high school students from countries all over the world participate in IELMUN and experience a high academic level and amazing social activities in the capital of culture and history, Istanbul. http://ielmun.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nİstanbul Lisesi Alumni gather every year in the school, on the first Sunday of Culture Week, to enjoy the traditional Aşure Day.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7698941", "categories": ["Boarding schools in Turkey", "Istanbulspor", "Educational institutions established in 1884", "Istanbul High School", "Fatih"], "title": "Istanbul High School"}

A capacitive inclinometer has a disc-like cavity that is partly filled with a dielectric liquid. One of the sides of the cavity has an etched conductor plate that is used to form one of the conductors of a variable parallel plate capacitor. The liquid along with the other side of the cavity forms the other plate of the capacitor. In operation, the sensor is mounted so that the disc is in a vertical plane with its axis horizontal. Gravity then acts on the liquid pulling it down in the cavity forming a semicircle. As the sensor is rotated the liquid remains in this semicircular pattern covering a different area of the etched plate. This change in area results in a change in the capacitance. The change in capacitance is then electronically converted into an output signal that is linear with respect to the input angle.\n\n", "id": "7699045", "categories": ["Dimensional instruments", "Accelerometers", "Inclinometers"], "title": "Liquid capacitive inclinometers"}

When he left school he was apprenticed to a wholesale druggist in Sheffield. In 1816, he moved to London where he took up an apprenticeship to a surgeon-apothecary before setting up on his own. At the end of 1824 he enrolled as a student of surgery at St Bartholomew's Hospital under the famous surgeon and lecturer John Abernethy (1764–1831). In April 1827 Marsden passed his MRCS examination to qualify as a full surgeon. He became an MD in 1838. \n\nAfter discovering the difficulties the poor had in obtaining medical treatment, Marsden sought to establish a free hospital in London for which \"poverty and sickness are the only passports\". In 1828 he set up a small dispensary at 16 Greville Street, Hatton Garden, Holborn, which was named the London General Institution for the Gratuitous Cure of Malignant Diseases. This was later constituted as the Royal Free Hospital, and moved to the Gray's Inn Road in the 1840s. \n\nA few years later, Marsden turned his attention to cancer sufferers and, in 1851, set up another small establishment in Cannon Row, Westminster. This grew into the Brompton Cancer Hospital (now the Royal Marsden Hospital, Fulham Road site).\n\nMarsden married Ann Bishop, known as Betsy-Ann, in 1820. They had four children, three sons and a daughter, but only one of them, Alexander Edwin Marsden, a surgeon (1832–1902), survived into adulthood. Betsy-Ann died of cancer in 1846 and Marsden married his second wife, Elizabeth Abbott.\n\nWilliam Marsden died at a hotel in Richmond, Surrey, in 1867.

Completed in 1874, it is one of the city's finest examples of Gothic Revival architecture. Its nearby former rectory, also known as the Bishop Acheson House, is one of its finest Colonial Revival houses. The two buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nThis Gothic church at 381 Main Street faces east from the west side of Main Street on the central block between Court and Washington streets. it is set back from the street with a lawn in front. Its substantial appearance, emphasized by the sombre tones of the heavy brownstone construction, contrasts greatly with the flat facades and brightly decorated storefronts on Main Street.\n\nThe Episcopal Church in Middletown had its beginnings as early as 1724. Unlike many Colonial Anglican churches, it was firmly committed to the patriot cause during the American Revolution. This is the third meeting house of the parish, which was formally established as Christ Church in 1750. Several of its ministers have become bishops, including Abraham Jarvis, John Williams, and Edward Campion Acheson, father of Dean Acheson.\n\nThe church was built in 1870-1874. Henry Dudley was the architect and the firm of McConochie, Moor and Mylechreest was the prime contractor. Constructed of local brownstone, this church displays a symmetrically arranged facade with a buttressed bell tower at the southeast corner. A large rose tracery window is the dominant decorative feature of this facade, which also displays arched and lancet windows. The tower lacks a spire but features narrow arched windows which emphasize its verticality, and echo the fenestration of the facades. The interior displays elaborate tracery trusses support on cast iron posts. The present altar and reredos were added around 1892 and were designed by Charles Haight of New York.\n\nIn the two decades following the American Civil War, a number of institutional buildings were constructed in the Gothic Revival style in Middletown. The design of this church is representative of that pattern.\n\nThe church continues to be used as a church and is in good condition. The restoration of most of the stained glass windows was completed in 2011. Its current rector is the Rev. Dana Campbell.\n\nThe former rectory at 144 Broad Street, also known as the Bishop Acheson House, is now St. Luke's Housing for the Elderly. It is of the Colonial Revival style and was built in 1902-1903. The builder and architect are not known.\n\nThis large house is set back from the street on a large, well landscaped lot. The street is primarily residential with mid to late 19th century houses. Nearby are two small commercial buildings and the Gothic Revival Russell Library.\n\nThis house, built in 1902, was the third rectory of the Holy Trinity Church. The Reverend Edward Campion Acheson, the eighteenth rector of the church, was the first occupant. His son, Dean Acheson, served as Secretary of State under President Harry S. Truman. Upon the Reverend Mr. Acheson's resignation from the pulpit in 1915 he became the sixth Bishop of Connecticut. the house no longer serves as a rectory for Holy Trinity Church. It is now residential apartments for the elderly, known as St. Luke's. \n\nThis large house is an excellent example of the Georgian Revival style, with well executed details: six column entrance portico with balustrade; Palladian window; and modillioned cornice.\n\nThe building has been converted into an elderly residential apartments run by St. Luke's.

Set in the future, the two romantic leads in this version are androids who fall in love despite a taboo against their kind having such relationships.\n\nThe special is also known as \"Runaway Robots! Romie-0 and Julie-8\".\n\nIn the future, two rival robotics firms are hard at work trying to create the next major leap in robotics. Both tout their wares at the latest robotics convention. The Mega Stellar Company has released their Romie-0 model of robot, while Super Solar Cybernetics has released Julie-8. However, unforeseen by their creators, Romie-0 and Julie-8 begin to fall in love, harboring feelings for the other.\n\nAfter the convention, Romie-0 comes to Julie-8, and admits that due to their company's rivalry, they most likely cannot be together. The two decide to run away in order to keep from being broken up. Unsure where to go, they come across a rather shifty individual named Gizmo, who agrees to help them find a safe haven.\n\nMeanwhile, both of the two robots' creators (Mr. Thunderbottom and Ms. Passbinder) find that their creations are gone. At first they blame the other for stealing their creation, but then agree to work in tandem to find their robots when it turns out that neither one knows what has become of them.\n\nUnknown to the two creators, Gizmo has transported Romie-0 and Julie-8 to a planet of junk named Trash-0-Lot, where the two come face-to-face with an enormous Junk Monster named Sparepartski. The monster has Romie-0 transported to the other side of the planet, but imprisons Julie-8 for his own purposes. Gizmo appears to her shortly afterward, and suggests that she offer to marry the Junk Monster in exchange for Romie-0's freedom off the planet. Julie-8 decides to try this offer, and Sparepartski accepts, much to the girl's displeasure. While happy for Romie-0's release, Julie-8 is saddened over her fate, and removes a necessary circuit, causing her to 'die.' In the meantime Sparepartski has found Thunderbottom and Passbinder's ship nearby, and taken them prisoner as well.\n\nUnknown to Julie-8, Romie-0 has managed to escape from the other side of the planet, and has made his way to her chambers. Upon finding her with her circuit removed, Romie-0 reinstalls it, and the two attempt to escape. Along their way out, they encounter their creators trussed up, and set about freeing them.\n\nHowever, their escape does not go unnoticed, and Sparepartski soon starts to chase them across the junkscape. The two robot lovers carry their creators in hopes to get them to safety, but end up locking up when they run into a 'rust storm.' The immobilization of the two robots causes their creators to carry them out of harm's way.\n\nThe rust storm also claims Sparepartski, who it is then revealed was a giant scrap concoction created and operated by Gizmo. Gizmo reveals his love for machines, and after seeing Julie-8 at the robotics convention, wanted to make her his bride. Romie-0 and Julie-8 then convince Gizmo that with the amount of trash on the planet, he could very well fashion his own sweetheart. Meanwhile, Mr. Thunderbottom and Ms. Passbinder (who have fallen in love with each other) have reconciled their differences, deciding to unite their robotics houses in a merger, much to the delight of Romie-0 and Julie-8.\n\nSongs for \"Romie-0 and Julie-8\" were composed by John Sebastian, with musical score by Patricia Cullen, both of whom had also worked on the preceding Nelvana cartoon \"The Devil and Daniel Mouse\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699151", "text": "The Market for Liberty\n\nThe Market for Liberty is an anarcho-capitalist book written by Linda and Morris Tannehill, which according to Karl Hess has become \"something of a classic.\" It was preceded by the self-published \"Liberty via the Market\" in 1969. Mary Ruwart credits the Tannehill's book with winning her over to anarcho-capitalism. Doug Casey was also converted to anarcho-capitalism after reading the book at the behest of Jarret Wollstein. According to the Ludwig von Mises Institute, it was written just following a period of intense study of the writings of both Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard. It was the first significant anarcho-capitalist work to hit the libertarian movement, coming into print a year before Rothbard's \"Power and Market\" although Rothbard's book had been written earlier.\n\nLike Rothbard's \"Man, Economy, and State\", \"The Market For Liberty\" opposes statutory law and advocates natural law as the basis for society; however, unlike \"Man, Economy, and State\", which explains what sort of libertarian legal code the market would create in an anarcho-capitalist society, \"The Market for Liberty\" points out that society would not be lawless in the absence of the state. Conversely, \"The Market for Liberty\" spends a great deal of time outlining how different businesses and organizational structures would interact in a laissez-faire society and how these interactions would create checks which would ultimately keep the tendency for crime low. In keeping with radical free-market principles, the book is skeptical about the potential for violent anarcho-capitalist revolution to bring about good outcomes.\n\nChapter 1, \"If We Don't Know Where We're Going...\", notes the growing dissatisfaction among youth, the many problems society faces, and the need for a clear goal rather than just an adversary (e.g. the state). It claims that the authors are not advocating any type of utopia that depends on the infallibility of man in order to function. It contends that if the present system is brought crashing down without valid ideas having been disseminated about how society can function without governmental rule, people will demand a strong leader, and a Hitler will rise to answer their plea.\n\nChapter 2, \"Man and Society\", argues that the nature of man is such that he must think and produce in order to live; and that in order to reach his full potential, he must have the right not only to do these things but to enjoy the rewards of his productive actions. It defines a laissez-faire society as one that \"does not \"institutionalize\" the initiation of force and in which there are means for dealing with aggression justly when it does occur.\" It notes that only the possessor of a right can alienate himself from that right. If one does $100 of damage to a taxicab, for instance, then he alienates himself from his right to that $100. The cabbie then has a moral right to use force to collect it.\n\nChapter 3, \"The Self-Regulating Market\", states that state interference causes the buyer, the seller, or both in a transaction to lose and that only a voluntary trade can be a completely satisfactory trade. It notes that markets clear; that taxation is economic hemophilia; regulation amounts to slow strangulation; that market monopolies can only attain and maintain monopoly status through excellence and low prices; and that without freedom of the market, no other freedom is meaningful. It criticizes the government for red tape which denies entrepreneurs opportunities to rise out of poverty.\n\nChapter 4, \"Government – An Unnecessary Evil\", states that government is a coercive monopoly; that democratic governments decide issues largely on the basis of pressure from special interest groups; and that the notion of \"a government of laws, not of men\" is meaningless because laws must be written and enforced by men, and therefore a government of laws \"is\" a government of men. It argues that the eternal vigilance which is held to be the price of liberty is a constant non-productive expenditure of energy, and that is it grossly unreasonable to expect men to keep expending their energy in such a way out of unselfish idealism. It also argues that because of the danger of one interest group using the government to impose laws favoring itself or crippling its opponents, people are constantly in fear of different interest groups. Thus, blacks fear suppression by whites; whites worry about blacks gaining too much power; and any number of other groups, such as labor and management, urbanites and suburbanites, etc., are pitted against each other. Government is identified as a cause of strife. The checks and balances of government are also recognized as a source of waste that is no substitute for external checks such as competition. This chapter identifies many tools by which the government convinces people that government is necessary, such as state schools that brainwash the young into accepting pro-State ideas, investing government with tradition and pomp and identifying it with \"our way of life.\" It also blames people for having a fear of self-responsibility.\n\nChapter 5, \"A Free and Healthy Economy\", begins by noting the difficulties people have in picturing a society radically different from their own. It concludes that poverty would be better addressed by a laissez-faire society for many reasons, including the fact that unemployment is caused by the government, that untaxed businesses would have more profits to reinvest in productivity-enhancing technology, that private charities are more efficient than government, that parents would be more likely to avoid having excess children in the absence of social safety nets, etc. It argues that a plethora of choices in education would emerge in a free market. It also notes that the focus of media in a laissez-faire society would shift from covering government to covering business and individuals and that abuses would be checked by reporters looking for stories on aggression or fraud. The chapter argues that the quality of health care could be more efficiently kept at an adequate level through reputation, standards instituted by insurance companies, etc. It also discusses how currency could be provided without government.\n\nChapter 6, \"Property – The Great Problem Solver\", argues that most social problems could be solved through an increase in the amount and type of property owned. It claims that taxation is theft and that regulation by initiated force is slavery. It argues that it should be possible to claim ownership over the ocean floor, the surface of other planets, corridors of airspace, radio wavelengths, and so on, by being the first to occupy them or otherwise clearly stake out territory. It also argues that all public property should be privatized in order to reduce crime and pollution.\n\nChapter 7, \"Arbitration of Disputes\", argues that governmental arbiters are not necessary, since a man who agrees to the settlement of disputes by a third party and then breaks the contract would suffer harm to his reputation and be ostracized, thus solving the problem of noncompliance. It notes that the government's judges will tend to be biased in favor of government, since that is the entity from which they receive their salaries and power. It promotes the concept of insurance companies as a substitute for government as the institution used to pursue claims; in the event a person were defrauded, they could file a claim with their insurance company, and the insurer would obtain the right of subrogation. Insurers who, themselves, committed abuses would suffer loss of reputation and be at a competitive disadvantage to more reputable insurers.\n\nChapter 8, \"Protection of Life and Property\", asserts that a person has the right to defend his life against aggression; and that he therefore has the right to defend his possessions as well, since they are the results of his investment of parts of his life and are, thus, extensions of that life. It notes, \"Pacifism encourages every thug to continue his violent ways, even though the pacifist may devoutly wish he wouldn't (wishes don't create reality). Pacifistic behavior teaches the aggressor that crime does pay and encourages him to more and bigger aggressions. Such sanctioning of injustices is immoral, and because it is immoral, it is also impractical.\" It argues that self-defense is a personal responsibility, which one can fulfill by hiring an agent to protect him, such as a private defense agency. It distinguishes initiated force from retaliatory force, noting that the former is not a market phenomenon because it acts to destroy the market; but the latter is a market phenomenon because it restrains aggressors who would destroy it and/or exacts reparations from them. It notes that government creates a social environment which breeds crime through its prohibitions on gambling, prostitution, drugs, and so on. It argues that the main role of police is to protect the government, rather than the citizens. It contrasts the police with private defense agencies, which would focus on preventing aggression and whose officers would lack immunity for any offenses they might commit. It also notes that insurance companies might sell policies covering the insured against loss resulting from any type of coercion and that these insurers could bring unruly defense agencies to their knees through ostracism and boycotts. Yet, at the same time, the insurers would seek to avoid taking such action without cause, since it could be costly and result in boycotts against the insurer itself.\n\nChapter 9, \"Dealing with Coercion\", argues that punishment in the form of eye for an eye vengeance does nothing to compensate the victim, and therefore opposes justice. It argues that an aggressor should repay the victim for his loss and for all expenses occasioned by the aggression, such as the cost of apprehending the offender. It further states that when an offender could not pay the restitution for a crime in his lifetime, the additional expenses could be paid by the insurance company.\n\nChapter 10, \"Rectification of Injustice\", notes that some criminals of a particularly untrustworthy nature might need to work off their debt in workhouses. To insure against refusal to work, the reparations payments would be deducted from each pay before room and board costs, and those who refused to work would not eat or would have only a minimal diet. A variety of degrees of confinement would exist. The argument that the rich would buy crime is refuted by the argument that even a wealthy man could be killed in self-defense if he attempted a violent act and that he would risk his reputation as well.\n\nChapter 11, \"Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime\", asserts the falsity of the assumption that government is necessary to prevent the initiation of force by arguing that government, as a coercive monopoly, must initiate force in order to survive. It notes several factors that would make a private defense agency avoid aggression. It would put itself at risk of retaliation and would lead its customers to fear that, in the event of a falling-out, it would turn its aggressive force against them. Moreover, insurers would consider the company to be a poor risk. Its employees would also be liable for any damages they caused, which would cause problems between the companies and its employees if it ordered unjustified attacks. It also speculates that a mafia-style agency would be unlikely to survive since there would be no black market to support it. The chapter argues that a tyrant would have more difficulty rising to power under a system of competing private defense agencies than under a governmental system, because customers oppressed by their company could simply switch to another company and obtain protection from the tyrant.\n\nChapter 12, \"Legislation and Objective Law\", argues that free men, acting in a free market, would manage their affairs in accordance with natural law. It calls statutory law a clumsy, anachronistic, and unjust hindrance. It also argues that government judges have no market signals to guide their decisions, in contrast to free-market arbiters, who have profit and loss as a built-in correction mechanism.\n\nChapter 13, \"Foreign Aggression\", notes that governments obtain the resources used for defense from the people, and those same resources can be used by private defense agencies to protect the people from aggression. It argues that governments aggravate or threaten other governments to the point of armed conflict and then coerce their citizens into protecting them. It notes that the ability of aggression insurers to pay claims would be enhanced by the limited damage resulting from the fact that foreign aggressors would need to use conventional warfare in wars of conquest to avoid destroying the property and slaves they seek to gain. It notes that in a laissez-faire society, there would be no government that could surrender to the enemy; defenders would fight as long as they perceived it was in their best interest.\n\nChapter 14, \"The Abolition of War\", argues that government, not business, is responsible for the formation of the military–industrial complex. It notes that the burden of supporting wars falls heavily on business, since taxes are taken out of the pocket of the consumer. Moreover, businesses are a society's producers, and it is a society's producers who pay the bills. Business also suffers from wars because of the disruption of trade and the ruin and poverty that result. Government, however, gains from wars because it is left with more power, more money, and more territory. War also helps unite the people behind the government in the face of a \"common enemy.\" The authors conclude that all that is needed to abolish war is to abolish government.\n\nChapter 15, \"From Government to Laissez Faire\", argues that first and foremost, the economy should be provided with media of exchange to replace the dollar. It states that possession of public property should be taken by individuals who, simply by clearly marking their claims, become the rightful owners. It argues against disposing of public property at auction, since bureaucrats would figure out ways to divert the proceeds into their own pockets, and the system would be biased toward the rich, many of whom obtained their wealth through political pull. The process of auctioning off the property would also prolong the politicians' power.\n\nChapter 16, \"The Force Which Shapes the World\", argues that it is immoral to destroy the private property or life of an individual who has not aggressed against one. It argues that violent revolution is not only destructive, but actually strengthens the government. It also notes that a revolution's leaders could then become the next rulers. Because of the people's desire for a leader to get them out of chaos, the chapter opines that a violent revolution would pave the way for a new Hitler. This chapter calls for people to share ideas related to freedom, which can eventually lead to widespread non-cooperation with government.\n\n", "id": "7699151", "categories": ["1970 books"], "title": "The Market for Liberty"}

The school was renamed Johnson Academy and moved to a new building on the corner of Parramore Avenue and Jefferson Street. In 1921, a brick Colonial Revival building was constructed on the corner of Parramore Avenue and Washington Street at a cost of $34,000. The school was renamed for the final time in honor of L. C. Jones, a longtime school principal and donor of the property.\n\nIt was a member of the Florida Interscholastic Athletic Association.\n\nIn 1952, the school moved west of downtown to its current location on Rio Grande Avenue. A new campus consisting of a two-story academic building, separate buildings for science, technology, and music, an administrative building, cafeteria, gymnasium, media center, and dedicated historical museum was constructed during the period 2001–2004. During construction, students attended classes in portables across the street from the campus. The new campus was opened for the start of the 2004–2005 school year.\n\nIn 1988, as part of a schoolwide project, Jones entered the Guinness Book of World Records for creating the World's Largest Box of Popcorn. Aided by a propane-powered air popper designed by engineering students from the University of Central Florida, Jones students popped of popcorn. Orville Redenbacher, whose company donated the unpopped corn, mentioned the feat during a broadcast of the now-defunct Pat Sajak Show.\n\nJones High School is an International Baccalaureate World School, offering the Diploma Programme for juniors and seniors and the Middle Years Programme for freshmen and sophomores in articulation with Memorial Middle School.\n\nJones High students may also enroll in its Medical Arts Magnet Program or in an advanced studies program of multiple Advanced Placement (AP) courses.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699200", "text": "Parchís (group)\n\nParchis was a 1980s children's music group from Spain which enjoyed moderate success in countries around the world. Parchis' original five members were Constantino Fernández Fernández (the red pawn), Yolanda Ventura Román (the yellow pawn), Oscar Ferrer Cañadas (the blue pawn), Gemma Pratts Tremens (the green pawn), and David Muñoz Forcada (the rolling die, which is singular for dice). After several line-up changes, the group disbanded in 1986 with various members continuing successful careers in the world of entertainment.\n\nThe group's name is a reference to the board game, Parcheesi (translated as Parchís in Spanish), where each player represents a different colored pawn (red, yellow, blue, and green). In the same way, each member of the group dressed in one of these four colors with the fifth member representing the dice.\n\nParchis was created in 1979, after executives from the Belter Records company placed a newspaper ad in Barcelona, asking children to attend auditions to form a musical group. At first, Belter Records intended to employ the group members during summers only; the company's executives figured out that would be the best season of the year for Parchis albums and concerts to sell.\n\nParchis was neither a boy or girl band. Eventually, the band expanded to have six members at the same time. Gemma Pratts Teremens, David Muñoz Forcada, Oscar Ferrer Cañadas, Constantino Fernández Fernández (better known as Tino), and Yolanda Ventura (daughter of the well known trumpet player, Rudy Ventura) were the first five kids to be chosen as members of Parchis.\n\nTino was the heartthrob of the group; Gemma was the shy one; Yolanda was every boy's crush; Frank, who joined in 1981 after Oscar left, was the extroverted red head; and David, a blonde haired boy, was the best dancer and the life of the party.\n\nParchis' first single, \"En La Armada\", was a Spanish version of the Village People's disco hit, \"In the Navy\". \"En La Armada\" became a major hit in Spain, giving way for a number of important music composers to start working with Parchis. \"En La Armada\" was followed by what was arguably the group's biggest hit, \"Durante la Espera de Parchis\" (\"During Parchis' Wait\"). This song became a number one hit in Argentina. Later on, the group also became successful in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and other American countries.\n\nPersonal problems forced Oscar Ferrer Caňadas out of the band in 1981. He was substituted by Francisco Díaz Terez, known by fans simply as \"Frank\". Brothers Miguel Ángel Gómez Cambronero (born in Germany) and Jesús Gómez Cambronero joined the band after Tino and David left the group in 1983.\n\nLosing Tino proved lethal to the group, however. With Menudo reaching unprecedented (for a Hispanic children's music group) success levels in Latin America as well as in Spain, and other Latin American groups like Los Chamos and Los Chicos also providing Parchis with competition, and with Ferrer Cañadas' considerable number of fans gone, Parchis began to wane.\n\nIn Spain and Argentina in particular, however, the group remained popular enough to release a 1983 movie, \"Parchis Entra en Acción\" (translated as \"Parchis Gets Into Action\" in English), alongside Alberto Fernández de Rosa.\n\nIn 1985, Parchis broke up. The group had recorded a number of albums that were successful in Spain and Latin America. More than a decade later, the group would reunite for one television show engagement.\n\nToday Tino is married and works as a top executive in a company; Gemma is a kindergarten teacher and works as a principal in a kindergarten she owns and has a daughter named Mireia; Frank is an entrepreneur and model, he too is married and has a daughter named Ona; Yolanda moved to Mexico to pursue a career as an actress where she had moderate success. She is married and has son named Alex. David earned a degree in economics and works in an investment group he created along with his school buddies. He is not married. All except Yolanda live in Barcelona.\n\nOn February 10, 2008, Parchis made an appearance on the Mexican television show \"Muevete\" It was the first time in 25 years that they were all together on the same stage. They were introduced and sang the song \"PARCHIS\" with everyone in attendance. Tino spoke of a comeback and wanting to sing again. They were interviewed for about one hour and spoke about their romances and adventures during their tour. They announced plans to tour again and come out with a new album. In the opening sequence, they all stood on a colored circle and the curtains came up, but there was a problem with Gemma's circled curtain that didn't come up in time, but she continued to sing. This was the highest viewed program in Mexico for the year so far.\n\nThe red pawn, lead vocal in many songs, and the leader of the group. After his time in the group was done, he tried to gain popularity as a solo artist. He released three albums, but with little success. As an adult, he worked for the company Artel. During this time, he lost his left arm in a car accident in the vicinity of Murcia. He currently resides in Barcelona, where he is a radio sports commentator. He is married with no children.\n\nThe yellow pawn, and every boy's crush. She is the daughter of the famous Spanish musician Rudy Ventura. After her time in Parchis, Yolanda eventually began a career in acting, starting off with television shows in Spain, soon making her way to Mexico where she lives and works exclusively for Televisa. She married actor Alejandro Aragon, and has a son with the same name. The marriage ended, and she now maintains a relationship with fellow actor Odiseo Bichir.\n\nThe green pawn, and the shyest member of the group. Eventually went on to study childcare, and ran a kindergarten in Barcelona. She is now working as a clerk, and is married with a daughter.\n\nThe white die, and the group's dancer. He was said to have been chosen for the group because dancing came so easily to him. After Parchis, he went to Scotland to study economics, and currently works for an advertisement company. He is married and lives in the United States.\n\nThe blue pawn, the smallest group member and the first one to leave. There's never been a clear reason behind his departure. As an adult, he graduated with a degree in journalism and political science. He now works as a marketing manager in a communication group. He is married.\n\nThe blue pawn, Oscar's replacement and the extroverted red head. Despite his young age joining the group, Frank already had experience as an advertising model. Mistakenly, he is often referred to as an original member. He continued on with music even after leaving Parchis, and started his own rock band. He is now an entrepreneur, and has a wife and daughter.\n\nThe red pawn, and Tino's replacement as the group's leader, which proved to be a difficult task. After Parchis, he continued on in the world of music, and formed a band called \"Platón\" with his brother Michel.\n\nThe white die, David's replacement, and the last new member to join. Michel joined so late in the group, he had to learn many of the group's dance moves on the plane to their next destination just hours before their next show. After Parchis, he and his brother Chus formed the group \"Platón\" in 1992.\n\nAlbum 1 : \"Las Super 25 Canciones de Los Peques\" (España - 1979) \n\nAlbum 2 : \"Comando G\" (España - 1980)\nAlbum 3 : \"La Batalla de Los Planetas\" (España - 1980) (Cassette only) \n\nAlbum 4 : \"Twist Del Colegio\" (España - 1980)\n\nAlbum 5 : \"La Guerra de Los Niños\" (España - 1980)\n\nAlbum 6 : \"Nadales\" (España - 1980)\n\nAlbum 7 : \"Villancicos\" (España - 1980)\n\nAlbum 8 : \"Parchis Contra el Inventor Invisible\" (Argentina - 1981)\n\nAlbum 9 : \"Corazon de Plomo\" (España - 1981)\n\nAlbum 10 : \"Parchis y Sus Amigos\" (España - 1981)\n\nALBUM 11 : \"La Segunda Guerra de Los Niños\" (España - 1981)\n\nAlbum 12 : \"La Magia de Los Parchis\" (Argentina - 1981)\n\nAlbum 13 : \"Cumpleaños Feliz\" (España - 1982)\n\nAlbum 14 : \"Las Aventuras de los Parchis\" (Argentina 1982)\n\nAlbum 15 : \"Las Locuras de Parchis\" (España - 1982)\n\nAlbum 16 : \"Feliz Navidad\" (España - 1982)\n\nAlbum 17 : \"Super Discolandia\" (España- 1983)\n\nAlbum 18 : \"Siempre Parchis\" (España - 1983)\n\nAlbum 19 : \"Que Tal Te Va\" (España - 1984)\n\nAlbum 20 : \"Decidete, Atrevete\" (Mexico - 1985)\n\n", "id": "7699200", "categories": [], "title": "Parchís (group)"}

Points scored for killing monsters and picking up gold count towards experience, and the character gains levels at regular intervals. With each level, the character's health bar increases, other attributes such as range improve, and the character also becomes invulnerable for a few seconds. Along the way, different weapon and armor upgrades for each character may also be picked up.\n\n\"King of Dragons\" features a simple control system that consists of a single attack button, and a jump button. By pressing both buttons, the character unleashes a magical attack that strikes all enemies in screen (its strength varies according to the character used) at the expense of losing energy. The fighter, cleric and dwarf can also use their shield to block certain attacks by tilting the joystick back right before the impact.\n\nThis is one of the many Capcom games to feature the yashichi power-up item. There are three such power-ups hidden throughout the game, each giving the player an extra continue.\n\nThe five playable heroes each have their own traits and fighting skills in the game. The Fighter is very good with melee attacks and defense but lacks magical ability. The Dwarf is able to dodge and block attacks, is the most agile character that has decent melee attacks albeit the shortest range and little magic ability. The Elf has good agility and great range with archery but is not physically strong. The Cleric has great defense, decent magic (with the ability to heal his comrades) and melee attacks but bad agility. The Wizard has poor defense but very good magical attacks and quick melee attacks.\n\nThe game was ported to the Super NES in 1994. This port reduces the number of simultaneous players down to two. The sprites' size were also reduced moderately. It is also possible to assign the magic attack and shield defense to different buttons.\n\nThe arcade version is part of \"Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2\", which was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in November 2006.

This seat was often placed in hallways, carved with a family's \"imprese\" or emblem drawn from its coat-of-arms.

Eames Vacuume Brake Company had previously been in existence since 1876 manufacturing vacuum brakes. The new company erected ten new buildings on Beebee Island and nearby shores just in time for a booming brake market driven by an 1893 law mandating standardized brakes for all railroad cars.\n\nIn 1902, NYAB bought the Poole Farm in Watertown, NY, and began its move to its present location. The new Works were planned as a model industrial enterprise, providing housing, work, and recreation for 1,000 employees on the grounds. The workers, however, decided that they did not want to live next door to their workplace and the plan was scrapped. In 1903, the new foundry became the first part of the new plant to begin operations.\n\nDuring this period NYAB's main competition was Westinghouse Air Brake Company, which lead the market in locomotive braking sales. Despite Westinghouse's lead, American railroads preferred to have two brake suppliers. James Hill, builder of the Great Northern Railway, and the New York Central Railroad were especially supportive of New York Air Brake's technology. In 1912, NYAB and Westinghouse agreed to share the market, along with research and development. NYAB's 25 percent share of the brake market soared to $3 million per year by 1914.\n\nIn 1915, NYAB shifted focus of their current manufacturing of vacuum brakes to efforts toward the First World War. Sales grew from $4.7 million in 1915 to $24 million in 1916. By 1918, the company employed 7,000 who were involved in defense manufacturing, including the production of horse-drawn cannons.\n\nAfter World War I, it was decided that a new braking system needed to be developed to provide braking power for the ever growing freight train industry. Engineers at New York Air Brake contributed to the development of what came to be known as the \"AB\" brake. During the mid-1930s, at the same time the \"AB\" brake was being widely implemented, the pneumatic and electro-pneumatic braking equipment for modern, high-speed locomotives and passenger trains were engineered and produced at the Watertown facilities.\n\nA dramatic drop in sales following the end of World War I led New York Air Brake to seek new markets. In 1919, the company built and marketed a \"Three-Point Truck;\" an \"enormous affair, the four wheels alone weighing nearly one ton. The machine had a wheelbase, and an overall length of . It weighed about 8,100 pounds and had a carrying capacity of from three to six tons...\" It was not a success.\n\nIn 1925, new management announced another try at the auto industry with the introduction of the Gerlinger hydraulic lumber carrier; an engine, and a cab set high atop a lumber rack. The project faded quickly.\n\nWestinghouse and New York Air Brake began development of a replacement for the venerable \"K Brake\" in 1929. The Great Depression slowed, but did not stop, development of the new brake and, in April 1932, New York Air Brake began construction of a 200-car test track, the largest in the world. In 1934, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) voted to adopt the new composite AB brake. Despite the Depression, the company maintained employment for 300 workers, many on a part-time basis.\n\nIn 1945, New York Air Brake again returned to aiding the United States' war effort in World War II. Up until the end of the war, NYAB became a producer of tank hulls for the Sherman tank, anti-aircraft shells, automatic pilots for aircraft, breech mechanisms for guns, hydraulic pumps for fighter aircraft, and other military hardware and had over 5,000 employees contributing to the war effort in the war-torn Europe by the end of 1944.\n\nBy the end of the Second World War, New York Air Brake had expanded its product line to include hydraulic aircraft pumps. In 1949, the company furthered its market reach with the purchase of the Hydraulic Equipment Company Dudco Products Company. As a result, sales leapt from $18 million in 1950 to more than $45 million in 1957.\n\nOn June 15, 1967, NYAB merged with General Signal Corporation. In 1980, Congress passed the Staggers Act, which deregulated the railroad industry. As a result of the ending of tax breaks for railroad car ownership, new car and brake orders plummeted from 96,000 in 1979 to 5,800 in 1983. In November 1982, the company put into effect a series of workforce cutbacks that enabled NYAB to survive this difficult time.\n\nMeantime, in 1972 New York Air Brake's lobbying in Albany, NY landed a trial run with the New York City transit system. The company was allowed to equip one eight car R44 train numbers 368-379, with one spare four car set of brakes each, making it a total of 12 cars equipped with same.. One trouble-free year later, New York Air Brake signed a $25 million contract to provide brake systems and controls for New York transit's entire fleet of 754 R46 subway cars, the beginning of over a decade of providing brakes to commuter lines. By 1990, New York Air Brake had furnished $100 million worth of equipment for more than half of New York City's R62A's, R68's and R110A/R110B subway cars before NYAB's Transit Division was established as the Knorr Brake Company and moved to Westminster, Maryland.\n\nOn January 2, 1991, Knorr-Bremse acquired New York Air Brake's rail braking business from General Signal, however, they did not purchase Stratopower, or Dynapower. Knorr-Bremse is a maker of braking systems for rail and truck vehicles.\n\nBy the end of 1993, NYAB stopped manufacturing the Westinghouse brake in favor of Knorr-Bremse's improved DB-60 air brake featuring poppet valve technology. Consolidation of operations into one building, tax abatements, and state funding kept the company in Watertown.\n\nSince its acquisition, NYAB has modernized under Knorr-Bremse creating the most technologically advanced rail brake manufacturing facility in North America.\n\nAt the end of 2009, NYAB operations included Train Dynamic Systems (TDS) in Irving, Texas, Knorr Brake Limited in Kingston, Ontario, a brake shoe manufacturer, a brake hose manufacturer, and two Service Centers in Little Rock, Arkansas and Riverside (Kansas City) Missouri.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7699421", "categories": [], "title": "New York Air Brake"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699445", "text": "KNGO\n\nKNGO (1480 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Dallas, Texas. The station features a Hindi hit music radio format for the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex South Asian community. It calls itself \"Radio Salaam Namaste.\" KNGO's broadcast license is held by Hammond Broadcasting Group, LLC.\n\nIn recent years, the station got a boost in daytime power to 50,000 watts, the maximum for AM stations. It reduces power at night to 1,900 watts to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 1480. The transmitter is off of South Saint Augustine Road in Dallas.\n\nThe station, now known as KNGO, signed on as KGKO on January 1953. The station played pop music and jazz. In 1958, KGKO changed its call sign to KBOX and it adopted a top 40 format to compete with Gordon McLendon's top-rated 1190 KLIF. Future WABC disc jockey Dan Ingram was an early voice on KBOX. Within a year, the station, known variously as \"Wonderful K-Box in Dallas,\" \"Big Top Radio,\" and \"Tiger Radio,\" had rocketed from the bottom of the ratings to a near-tie with KLIF, and remained highly rated through the coming decade. K-Box was the only radio station covering President John F. Kennedy's motorcade live when he was assassinated on November 22, 1963. (Although KLIF was widely acclaimed for its later coverage of the President's death and the ensuing events, it was not broadcasting live from the motorcade route.)\n\nKBOX put an FM station on the air at 100.3 MHz on Christmas Day 1965. KBOX-FM mostly simulcast KBOX AM 1480. It later took a beautiful music format as KMEZ-FM and today is KJKK.\n\nGroup One Broadcasting of Texas acquired KBOX from Balaban Broadcasting in 1967 for $2 million.\n\nKBOX had never been able to defeat KLIF in the Top 40 arena. So on January 24, 1967, KBOX changed direction and went to a country format. The first song played on the new country KBOX was \"I've Got a Tiger By the Tail\" by Buck Owens (a nod to the station's former \"Tiger Radio\" moniker).\n\nKPCN 730 AM (now KKDA) was the first country station in the area, having started in 1962, but it broadcast during the daytime only. KBOX quickly became the ratings leader for country music in Dallas. In its first ratings book, it moved from a 10.0 share Q3 1966 to a 12.1 share in Q1 1967. KBOX had six years of solid ratings, posting a high of 14.4 in the Q3 1967 book. In 1972, 820 WBAP began giving KBOX stiff competition as a country-formatted 50,000-watt powerhouse. WBAP gained many listeners from KBOX.\n\nIn 1973, the Arbitron markets for Dallas and Fort Worth were combined into one book, to reflect the merging of the two cities into one metropolitan area. KBOX, like other smaller stations, was hurt by this redefinition. Some, like KBOX, did not even appear in the new ratings book. WBAP became the clear country winner at that point, as KBOX barely reached the Ft. Worth half of the newly defined market.\n\nIn April 1974, Group One applied for a nighttime power increase from 500 watts to 1 kilowatt and a move of the transmitter site to 32 52 15 N 96 42 54 W. The Federal Communications Commission approved it in February 1975. This gave KBOX a better signal, which is probably what allowed it to struggle into the 1980s, providing a more local service to Dallas, since WBAP is licensed to Fort Worth. But by 1980, FM radio was growing in dominance and the ability of KBOX to compete with a music format was waning.\n\nOn November 14, 1982, the KBOX call letters were dropped by Group One. KBOX became KMEZ and switched from its country format to a simulcast of the easy listening format of sister station KMEZ-FM.\n\nIn 1989, KMEZ-AM broke away from the FM station to adopt a business news/talk format as KDBN. This was followed in 1991 by the satellite-fed \"Stardust\" adult standards service from the Unistar Radio Network as KCMZ.\n\nMarcos A. Rodriguez purchased the station and changed the format to Spanish-language Banda music with call sign KMRT (1993–1998). Marcos A. Rodriguez picked the calls to connote the retailer K-Mart and imply good value for advertisers. KMRT was the first radio station in America to air the Banda format all the time. It operated with an automated Audio Server delivery.\n\nEventually, the call sign changed to KDXX (1998–2002), and KHCK (1998–2005), a simulcast of Tejano KHCK-FM \"Kick FM\" until the FM changed format to Cumbia music as KFZO and the AM continued as a stand-alone Tejano station for a few months. The KNIT call letters and a southern gospel format were adopted in March 2005, when it was briefly owned by Salem Communications.\n\nIn June 2007, the station joined the Spanish language sports network ESPN Deportes Radio, and it was the first ESPN Deportes station to be managed and operated by ESPN. 1540 KZMP picked up the ESPN Deportes format on June 1, 2009, almost two years after the format was first aired in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. The Deportes format was dropped by 1480 in August 2009.\n\nOn February 17, 2012, the call letters became KBXD.\n\nKBXD, along with co-owned stations WFLL, WFTL, and WMEN, was purchased out of bankruptcy by Mark Jorgenson's ACM JCE IV B LLC in a transaction that was consummated on August 6, 2015, at a purchase price of $5.5 million. A proposed sale to Chris Muse for $1.5 million on May 13, 2016, plus a $13,000 payment to break the station’s tower lease, was terminated without closing. The transmitting site was acquired from Salem Radio Properties. KBXD switched its format to South Asian pop music. In April 2017 the station suspended all programming and started running a continuous advertisement asking the listener \"If you are interested in renting this radio station call John Hammond at\"... The station is not transmitting a legal ID as required by the FCC. As of mid June 2017, the station is playing Hispanic music with station breaks in Spanish.\n\nEffective August 11, 2017, ACM sold KBXD to Hammond Broadcasting Group, LLC for $600,000.\n\nThe call letters were changed to KNGO on May 7, 2019.\n\n", "id": "7699445", "categories": ["Radio stations established in 1953", "Radio stations in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex"], "title": "KNGO"}

It was written by Steven Tyler and Brad Whitford and released as the first single from the album \"Rocks\" in 1976. It peaked at #21 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, one of a string of hits for the band in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe song is one of Brad Whitford's best-known contributions to the band. \"Brad wrote, 'Take me back to sweet Tallahassee, home sweet home…'\" recalled Tyler. \"Whatever he put into 'Last Child', that's his moment. He can take that, and that's his, forever.\"\n\nLive, Whitford plays a variation of the guitar solo as heard on the original recording. The song opens like a slow song, with careful playing of the guitar and Tyler's dreamy lyrics. After 22 seconds, it abruptly changes to a hard rocking, bluesy song, complete with a boogie background and two-guitar interplay between Whitford and Joe Perry, with Whitford playing the low notes of the riff on the verse and Perry playing funk chords higher up the neck.\n\nLong after its release, \"Last Child\" enjoys regular airplay on rock radio and is regularly rotated into Aerosmith's concert setlist. In concert, it is often Whitford's feature spot, in which Tyler introduces him with something like \"Brad Whitford, what do you got to show for yourself?\" or \"What do you got up your sleeve?\" Whitford often does a little bit of an intro before playing the opening notes to the song.\n\nAlthough it was often assumed that the guitar solo as heard on the studio recording was played by Joe Perry, it was originally rumored to have been played by an uncited (hired) guitarist. During his appearance as a guest on \"That Metal Show\" in 2012, Whitford stated that he actually wrote and performed the solo himself.\n\n\"Last Child\" has been rereleased on compilations including \"Aerosmith's Greatest Hits\", \"O, Yeah!

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699498", "text": "Swedish realism\n\nSwedish realism is the period in Swedish literature that encompassed the last two decades of the 19th century. It is generally considered to have ended in the 1910s but the exact year is a matter of debate.\n\nAugust Strindberg (1849-1912) was a writer world-famous for his dramas and prose, noted for his exceptional talent and complex intellect. In 1879 he published \"The Red Room\" (\"Röda Rummet\"), which brought him immediate fame. \"The Red Room\" was a satirical novel that relentlessly attacked the political, the academic, the philosophical and the religious worlds.\n\nAfter several harsh disputes, Strindberg left Sweden in 1883. In 1884, he briefly returned to Stockholm to stand trial in a blasphemy case against his collection of short stories \"Married\" (\"Giftas\"). He was acquitted, but the trial sparked a psychological turmoil that lasted for some 10 years, during which he wrote some of his internationally best known works: the self-examinatory \"Tjänstekvinnans son\" (1886–87), \"En dåres försvarstal\" (1887-87); and also plays \"Fadren\", \"Fröken Julie\" and \"Mäster Olof\" (1886–88).\n\nIn 1897 Strindberg engaged himself in occultism, in particular alchemy, leading to a mental breakdown known as his Inferno-crisis. The following year (1897), Strindberg moved back to Sweden and settled in the city Lund. There, he resurrected his literary production by publishing \"Inferno\".\n\nIn 1898, Strindberg moved back to Stockholm. He continued writing but also engaged himself energetically in debates in a wide range of subjects. His most notable writings during this period were his dramas, such as \"The Dance of Death\" (1900) and \"A Dream Play\" (1901).\n\nThe Swedish 1890s is noted for its poetic neo-romanticism, a reaction to the socio-realistic literature of the 1880s. The first literary key figure to emerge was Verner von Heidenstam (1859-1940), and his literary debut in 1887 with the collection of poetry \"Vallfart och vandringsår\" (Pilgrimage and Wander-Years).\nSelma Lagerlöf (1858-1940) was the arguably brightest star of the 1890s, and her impression has lasted up to modern times. She wrote several highly regarded works which are still among the toplists on Swedish libraries, such as \"Gösta Berlings saga\" (1891), an epic tale of the unmoral Gösta Berling who gets haunted by the Devil, and \"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils\" (1906-1907), a geographical adventure of Nils who travels Sweden on the back of a goose. Lagerlöf was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1909 for the imagination and spiritual perception that characterized her writings.\n\nGustaf Fröding (1860-1911) was another key figure of the 1890s. His active literary period only spanned between 1891–1898, because of mental problems. Fröding was above all renowned for his flowing poetry. His popularity was at first based on his bubbling sense of humor and free treatment of the poetic verse; but later readers also found in it a profound humanism and imaginative depth.\n\nErik Axel Karlfeldt (1864-1931) was, like Fröding, a depictor of rural life in his native province (in Karlfeldt's case, Dalarna). His poetry had the intention of sparking a cultural identity within Dalarna, and spoke warmly of traditions, family values, and so on. Although his poetry was narrow, Karlfeldt was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1931 (posthumously), possibly as a result of internal politics within the Swedish Academy.\n\n", "id": "7699498", "categories": ["Swedish literature"], "title": "Swedish realism"}

Built in 1856, it is a prominent local example of high-style Italianate architecture. Since 1904, it has served as the official residence of the president of Wesleyan University. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\nThe house faces east to the Connecticut River from the southwest corner of High Street and Wyllys Avenue. High Street between Church and Washington Streets was the most prestigious residential area in Middletown during the 19th century, and is now a part of the Wesleyan University campus. It is of a symmetrical cube form with a projecting pavilion, prominent porte cochere, and elaborate scrolled brackets beneath the eaves of the roof and cupola. The treatment of the windows is similarly elaborate with heavy flat pediments supported on consoles. There are elaborate crestings in the window pediments of the front facade. The entrance to the house is distinguished by the porte cochere with paired columns and a balustrade.\n\nThis house was built in 1856 by Gabriel Coite, on the site of a house formerly owned by gun maker Simeon North. Coite was a partner in his father's business in Brooklyn, New York, until he retired to Middletown in 1853. In 1860 he was elected State Senator; and in 1862 became treasurer of the State and moved to Hartford. In 1863, the house was acquired by Mrs. Jane Miles Hubbard, widow of Samuel D. Hubbard. Hubbard was co-founder of the Russell Manufacturing Company, builder of the Mansion block, and a Postmaster General. Wesleyan University purchased the property from Mrs. Hubbard's heirs in 1904 for use as the President's residence. Since then Presidents Raymond, Shanklin, Olin, McConaughty (later Governor of Connecticut), Butterfield, Etherington, and Campbell have occupied the house.\n\nThe large scale of this house, together with its elaborate decorative treatment, makes it one of the most sophisticated examples of its style in Middletown. Its site is at the highest elevation on Main Street, and thereby complements the imposing qualities of the architecture.\n\n\n", "id": "7699595", "categories": ["Landmarks in Connecticut", "Houses in Middletown, Connecticut", "Wesleyan University", "Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut"], "title": "Coite–Hubbard House"}

Braidotti then moved on to do her doctoral work at the Sorbonne, where she received her degree in philosophy in 1981. She has taught at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands since 1988, when she was appointed as the founding professor in women's studies. In 1995 she became the founding Director of the Netherlands research school of Women's Studies, a position she held till 2005.\n\nBraidotti is a pioneer in European Women's Studies: she founded the inter-university SOCRATES network NOISE and the Thematic Network for Women's Studies ATHENA, which she directed till 2005. She was a Leverhulme Trust Visiting Professor at Birkbeck College in 2005-6; a Jean Monnet professor at the European University Institute in Florence in 2002-3 and a fellow in the school of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1994. She is a founding member of the European Consortium for Humanities Institutes and Centres (ECHIC), 2008; in 2010 she was elected member of the Board of the Consortium Humanities Centres and Institutes (CHCI) and in 2014 a member of the Scientific Council of the Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique in France. Braidotti was the founding Director of the Centre for the Humanities at Utrecht University (2007-2016), and is currently Distinguished University Professor at Utrecht University.\n\nBraidotti serves, or has served, on the advisory board of many academic feminist journals, including \"differences\", \"Signs\", \"Women's Studies International Forum\", and \"Feminist Formations.\"\n\nBraidotti's publications have consistently been placed in continental philosophy, at the intersection with social and political theory, cultural politics, gender, feminist theory and ethnicity studies. The core of her interdisciplinary work consists of four interconnected monographs on the constitution of contemporary subjectivity, with special emphasis on the concept of difference within the history of European philosophy and political theory. Braidotti's philosophical project investigates how to think difference positively, which means moving beyond the dialectics that both opposes it and thus links it by negation to the notion of sameness.\n\nThis is evidenced in the philosophical agenda set in her first book \"Patterns of Dissonance: An Essay on Women in Contemporary French Philosophy\", 1991, which gets developed further in the trilogy that follows. In the next book, \"Nomadic Subjects: Embodiment and Difference in Contemporary Feminist Theory\", 1994, the question is formulated in more concrete terms: can gender, ethnic, cultural or European differences be understood outside the straitjacket of hierarchy and binary opposition? Thus the following volume, \"Metamorphoses: Towards a Materialist Theory of Becoming\", 2002, analyses not only gender differences, but also more categorical binary distinctions between self and other, European and foreign, human and non-human (animal/ environmental/ technological others).\n\nThe conclusion is that a systematic ambivalence structures contemporary cultural representations of the globalised, technologically mediated, ethnically mixed, gender-aware world we now inhabit. The question consequently arises of what it takes to produce adequate cultural and political representations of a fast-changing world and move closer to Spinozian notions of adequate understanding.\n\nThe ethical dimension of Braidotti's work on difference comes to the fore in the last volume of the trilogy, \"Transpositions: On Nomadic Ethics\", 2006. Here she surveys the different ethical approaches that can be produced by taking difference and diversity as the main point of reference and conclude that there is much to be gained by suspending belief that political participation, moral empathy and social cohesion can only be produced on the basis of the notion of recognition of sameness.\n\nBraidotti makes a case for an alternative view on subjectivity, ethics and emancipation and pitches diversity against the postmodernist risk of cultural relativism while also standing against the tenets of liberal individualism. Throughout her work, Braidotti asserts and demonstrates the importance of combining theoretical concerns with a serious commitment to producing socially and politically relevant scholarship that contributes to making a difference in the world. Braidotti's output also included several edited volumes. Her work has been translated in a total of 19 languages and all the main books in at least three languages other than English.\n\nHer most recent book is \"The Posthuman\" (Polity Press, 2013). \"The Posthuman\" offers both an introduction and major contribution to contemporary debates on the posthuman. As the traditional distinction between the human and its others has blurred, exposing the non-naturalistic structure of the human, \"The Posthuman\" starts by exploring the extent to which a post-humanist move displaces the traditional humanistic unity of the subject. Rather than perceiving this situation as a loss of cognitive and moral self-mastery, Braidotti argues that the posthuman helps us make sense of our flexible and multiple identities.\n\nBraidotti then analyzes the escalating effects of post-anthropocentric thought, which encompass not only other species, but also the sustainability of our planet as a whole. Because contemporary market economies profit from the control and commodification of all that lives, they result in hybridization, erasing categorical distinctions between the human and other species, seeds, plants, animals and bacteria. These dislocations induced by globalized cultures and economies enable a critique of anthropocentrism, but how reliable are they as indicators of a sustainable future?\n\n\"The Posthuman\" concludes by considering the implications of these shifts for the institutional practice of the humanities. Braidotti outlines new forms of cosmopolitan neo-humanism that emerge from the spectrum of post-colonial and race studies, as well as gender analysis and environmentalism. The challenge of the posthuman condition consists in seizing the opportunities for new social bonding and community building, while pursuing sustainability and empowerment.\n\nIn 2011 Braidotti published two new books: the renewed and revised edition of \"Nomadic Subjects\" and collection of essays \"Nomadic Theory. The Portable Rosi Braidotti\". The collection provides a core introduction to Braidotti's nomadic theory and its innovative formulations, which engage with Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Luce Irigaray, and a host of political and cultural issues. Arranged thematically, essays begin with such concepts as sexual difference and embodied subjectivity and follow with explorations in technoscience, feminism, postsecular citizenship, and the politics of affirmation.\n\nInfluenced by philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze and especially French feminist thinker Luce Irigaray, Braidotti has brought postmodern feminism into the Information Age with her considerations of cyberspace, prosthesis, and the materiality of difference. Braidotti also considers how ideas of gender difference can affect our sense of the human/animal and human/machine divides. Braidotti has also pioneered European perspectives in feminist philosophy and practice and has been influential on [third-wave as well as post-secular feminisms].\n\nOn 3 March 2005, Braidotti was honored with a Royal Knighthood from Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands; in August 2006 she received the University Medal from the University of Łódź in Poland and she was awarded an Honorary Degree in Philosophy from Helsinki University in May 2007. In 2009, she was elected Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. Since 2009 she is a board member of CHCI(Consortium of Humanities Centre and Institutes). In 2013 she received an Honorary Degree in Philosophy from Linköping University in Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7699598", "categories": ["Postmodern feminists", "Italian feminists", "Dutch feminists", "1954 births", "Lesbian academics", "Australian feminist writers", "Living people", "Feminist theorists", "Australian National University alumni", "Dutch academics", "People from Latisana", "Neo-Spinozism", "Utrecht University faculty"], "title": "Rosi Braidotti"}

He was born in Leith and brought up in the same area (Hutchison) as goalkeeper Tommy Younger, with whom he played for Hutchison Vale and the Army. Both players were then signed for Hibs by manager Hugh Shaw. He was taken by Hibs on a tour of Brazil in 1953 to play in three games in the Maracana stadium against Vasco da Gama, Botafogo and Fluminense. MacFarlane also played for Hibs in the first season of the European Cup, playing in five of the six matches possible. Hibs eventually lost to Stade Reims in the semi-final, where MacFarlane was pitted against Raymond Kopa.\n\nFormer teammate Tommy Preston described MacFarlane as \"resolute\", \"strong\" and capable of striking a good free kick.\n\nMacFarlane played for Raith Rovers and Morton later in his playing career.\n\nMacFarlane began his managerial career with East of Scotland League club Hawick Royal Albert. He joined Stirling Albion in March 1968, before taking a similar post at Hibernian in 1969. Chairman William Harrower appointed MacFarlane to replace Bob Shankly, who had resigned. Despite suffering early exits in the two cup competitions, Hibs qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup by finishing third in the Scottish League. During that first season, MacFarlane's team set a club record for consecutive wins. Hibs beat Malmö and Vitória de Guimarães to progress to the third round of the Fairs Cup, where they would lose to Bill Shankly's Liverpool side. That tie with Liverpool led to MacFarlane's departure from Hibs.

Having signed Erich Schaedler in his previous managerial post at Stirling Albion, MacFarlane made Schaedler his first signing as Hibs manager. He moved John Brownlie from playing in central defence to an attacking full back role, an \"inspirational\" choice. Having sold Peter Marinello to Arsenal for a record transfer fee, MacFarlane then signed Falkirk player Johnny Graham, who scored a hat-trick in his first game. He also signed Arthur Duncan, who went on to set the record for most league appearances for Hibs. Former player John Fraser, who worked as a coach for MacFarlane, described him as an \"enthusiastic\" manager, who established a good rapport with his players.\n\nAfter leaving Hibs, MacFarlane had a spell as manager of Meadowbank Thistle between 1978 and 1980.

The music was written by Elton John with lyrics by Tim Rice. The song is based on Timon and Pumbaa's catchphrase in the movie, \"Hakuna matata\", which is a Swahili phrase; it means 'no worries'. It is characterized by its simple 4/4 time, upbeat message and catchy lyrics.\n\nThe musical score was composed by Elton John with lyrics by Tim Rice. In the film the song is sung by Timon (a meerkat voiced by Nathan Lane), Pumbaa (a warthog voiced by Ernie Sabella), and Simba, a young lion voiced by Jason Weaver (singing voice as a cub) and Joseph Williams (as an adult). Taking place after the death of Mufasa, it features (Timon and Pumbaa), the two main comedy characters in the film, talking to Simba about moving forward from their troubled pasts and forgetting their worries, and Simba grows from cub to adult as the song progresses. The song also provides a backstory for Pumbaa, explaining that he was ostracized from animal society for his excessive flatulence. It makes use of a large proportion of the orchestra as well as many other more unusual instruments including an elaborate drum kit. Rice is said to have got the idea for the lyrics for the song from watching the comedy series \"Bottom\" and at one point wanted the show's stars Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson to play Timon and Pumbaa.\n\nA second version of the song, produced for the companion album \"Rhythm of the Pride Lands\", was performed by Jimmy Cliff featuring Lebo M. This version has a slightly modified, previously unreleased verse focusing on Timon's past. It was partially rewritten with a different instrument arrangement, but remains very similar to the original. This version of the song was released as a single with \"He Lives in You\" as a B-side and was ultimately used in the Broadway theatrical version of \"The Lion King\".\n\nThe song was based on an earlier song written early on in the production stage called \"Warthog Rhapsody\". Although the two songs shared the same message and position in the film, when Elton and Tim began to work on the music the song was completely rewritten and it eventually evolved into \"Hakuna Matata\". \"Warthog Rhapsody\" was eventually re-produced and released on \"Rhythm of the Pride Lands\".\nThe melody of Warthog Rhaspody was used in \"The Lion King 1½\" for the song \"That's All I Need\".\n\n\"Hakuna matata\" is a phrase in Swahili that is frequently translated as \"no worries\".

It is effectively the sequel to \"Complete Arcane\".\n\nThe book provides feats, prestige classes, and other options for characters interested in magic. Unlike \"Complete Arcane\", \"Complete Mage\" contains no new core classes, but it contains alternative class features for existing classes.\n\n\"Complete Mage\" adds 13 new alternative class features.\n\nRangers learn to track and hunt creatures of a certain type when choosing a favored enemy. Some rangers concern themselves less with what a creature is, and more with what it does. These rangers learn to identify signs of the arcane and make it their business to combat those who use arcane magic in opposition to their goals.\n\nEvery swashbuckler relies on her agility and quick wit to get her out of scrapes. Some take this a step farther, learning magical tricks that boost their mobility or defense.\n\nRare is the fighter who hasn't envied the wizard's bag of magical tricks. Although even the most basic arcane spell remains beyond a fighter's abilities, those who aspire to such talents can, with practice, learn to cast simple arcane spells while wearing light armor. On its own, this alternative feature grants little benefit to a single-classed fighter; only in conjunction with one or more levels of sorcerer, wizard, or a similar arcane spellcasting class does this ability come into play.\n\nMost paladins use their divinely granted powers to combat diseases that plague their allies. Paladins with an interest in the arcane particularly those who battle necromancers sometimes prefer to learn to counteract the effects of magical curses.\n\nAlthough the ability to turn undead is arguably a defining cleric characteristic, some clerics (and paladins) find that they can be even more effective crusaders by opposing evil spellcasters. The ability to negate an enemy spellcasters magic grants a character an unexpected edge.\n\nDeities influence the world through the divine spells they grant their worshipers. Some clerics, however, choose to explore magical powers beyond those commonly provided by the gods. By giving up some of their divine power, these clerics gain access to spells normally beyond their abilities.\n\nEvery druid reveres nature, but some pay more respect to the fundamental building blocks of the natural world than to its flora and fauna. By forgoing her bond with the animal kingdom, a druid can instead take on an elemental creature as her companion.\n\nEvery wizard who calls himself a specialist takes pride in wielding his preferred form of magic. Those who are exceptionally pure of purpose take this specialization to an entirely new level, disdaining breadth of skill in favor of even greater focus.\n\nThe traditional monk seeks balance in body, mind, and soul, and through this equilibrium gains various combat talents. A monk who learns the secret of the soulwarp strike masters an arcane talent of necromancy that infects her enemy's ki, producing an effect akin to terrible sickness.\n\nMany masters of stealth share the signature talent to avoid explosive blasts of magical energy. It takes only a little training, however, to twist this defensive flair into the ability to reflect magical attacks back upon their creator.\n\nMost barbarians and rogues have a preternatural awareness of danger, whether the threat of a nearby invisible attacker or the hidden peril of a spear trap. Some, however, fine-tune this ability to focus on magical attacks, granting them the ability to dodge the orbs, rays, and eldritch blasts of their enemies.\n\nBards pride themselves on being masters of language and sound. A rare few learn to use their voices to interfere with enemy spellcasters, twisting word and sound to defeat spells before they are cast.\n\nMost sorcerers hide behind walls of steel, slinging spells at enemies safely distant. You have no patience for such cowards and prefer to be near the front line. Your breadth of magical knowledge might not compare with those craven weaklings, but you are proud to dive into the fray alongside the fighter.\n\n\"Complete Mage\" was written by Skip Williams, Penny Williams, Ari Marmell, and Kolja Raven Liquette, and was published in October 2006. Cover art was by Matt Cavotta, and interior art is by Miguel Coimbra, Eric Deschamps, Wayne England, Carl Frank, Randy Gallegos, Ralph Horsley, Jim Nelson, Eric Polak, Mike Schley, Ron Spencer, Anne Stokes, Arnie Swekel, Eva Widermann, and Kieran Yanner.\n\nAndy Collins explains how this book relates to \"Complete Arcane\": \"Both books cover similar topics--how to enhance your character's magical (arcane) abilities. That said, they don't follow exactly the same format (though both contain spells, feats, and prestige classes as one might expect), so the range of subject matter varies a bit. \"Complete Mage\", for example, doesn't introduce new classes like \"Complete Arcane\" did, though it does provide some new options (feats, spells, and so on) for the new classes from \"Complete Arcane\".\"\n\nShannon Appelcline identified \"Complete Mage\" as one of the books that \"changed the way that \"D&D\" worked in dramatic ways\" and may have influenced the design of 4th edition \"D&D\".\n\n", "id": "7699736", "categories": ["2006 books"], "title": "Complete Mage"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699758", "text": "Death of Michael Stewart\n\nMichael Jerome Stewart (May 9, 1958, Brooklyn, New York – September 28, 1983, Manhattan, New York) was an African-American man who received recognition after his death following an arrest by New York City Transit Police for spray-painting graffiti on a New York City Subway wall at the First Avenue station. His treatment while in police custody and the ensuing trials of the arresting officers (all of whom were acquitted) sparked debate concerning police brutality and the responsibilities of arresting officials in handling suspects. This was a widely publicized episode in New York City's history of police brutality cases.\n\nWord of the arrest came out on September 15, 1983 as the Committee Against Racially Motivated Police Violence was holding a news conference to publicize a United States Congress hearing into complaints of police abuse. Stewart had been arrested earlier that day. He died at age 25, on September 28, after 13 days in a coma. The cause of death was listed as cardiac arrest.\n\nAt 2:50 a.m. on September 15, 1983, graffiti artist Michael Stewart was arrested for spraying graffiti at the First Avenue station on the Brooklyn-bound platform. Transit Police Officer John Kostick found Stewart scrawling “RQS” on the wall and had him arrested. Stewart allegedly said, \"Hey, man, you got me.\" Kostick cuffed Stewart and walked him to the turnstile to be identified. As Stewart was still living with his parents, he asked the police not to call his home to wake them up. Officer Kostick claimed Stewart was initially cordial, but suddenly ran off and had to be restrained while waiting for the arrest transport van. “At the top [of the stairs], Stewart fell face-forward on the ground,” said Kostick. The officer held Stewart to the ground until the van arrived, where several officers put him inside. Stewart was taken to the District 4 Transit Police station at 14th Street–Union Square, two stops away.\n\nWhile being taken to the station, Kostick said, Stewart became “very violent” in the van. Stewart struggled with the officers and ran to the street. He was beaten unconscious. He was hogtied, bound at the ankles and tethered hands-to-feet by an elastic strap. During the struggle, Stewart's wails could be heard by 27 Parsons School of Design students from their dorm windows. A Parsons student, Rebecca Reiss, heard Stewart say \"Oh my God, someone help me\", and \"What did I do? What did I do?\" He was booked at the Union Square District 4 transit police headquarters for resisting arrest and unlawful possession of marijuana. The transit police supervisors deemed Stewart emotionally disturbed. Stewart was placed back into the van and transported to Bellevue Hospital to undergo psychiatric observation. Stewart arrived at Bellevue at 3:22 a.m. He was handcuffed, his legs were bound, and he was comatose with a blood alcohol content of 0.22, more than double the 0.10 threshold needed to arrest someone for drunk driving. Stewart was dating Suzanne Mallouk at the time. She went with Stewart's family to see him at the hospital. According to their account, he had bruises and cuts on his body. The doctors confirmed he was brain dead and had hemorrhaged in a way that suggested he had either been choked or strangled. Stewart died on September 28, 1983, thirteen days after his arrest.\n\nIn charge of determining Stewart's cause of death was the city's medical examiner, Dr. Elliot M. Gross. Gross had three separate findings. He first declared Stewart had died due to excessive drinking, alcohol poisoning, which led to the coma and subsequent heart attack; thus, the police were not at fault. Stewart's family and advocates were unconvinced and believed this was a “classic cover-up.” In a second autopsy conducted a month later, Gross declared that Stewart had died from a spinal cord injury in the upper neck. In his third assessment he said that Stewart died from blunt-force trauma. According to \"The New York Times\", “Gross declined to specify what caused the injury, explaining only that 'there are a number of possibilities as to how an injury of these type can occur.' He refused to talk to press unless testifying before the grand jury.” Gross said Stewart's injuries, including the facial bruising and the abrasions on his wrists sustained during his arrest, were not said to contribute to his death. Nurses said his hands and face were blue when he arrived at the hospital, and that it took 3 minutes to remove the cuffs. They also said that he had been beaten brutally.\n\nStewart's family doctors contradict what was in the final autopsy report done by Gross. Doctors hired by Stewart's family to perform a secondary autopsy found his cause of death to be strangulation. Dr. Gross said there were no evidence of strangulation. Critical information such as Stewart's eyes were removed and held by Gross and were not allowed to be studied by the doctors hired by Stewart's family. His eyes were crucial because they would have shown evidence of hemorrhaging due to lack of oxygen from being strangled. Gross’ incompetence led the Stewart family to call for a petition to remove him as chief medical examiner claiming alleged wrongdoing and the medical examiners office cannot be trusted with the safekeeping of items. Following the trial, all six policemen were acquitted of criminal charges. Dr. Gross was later fired and Stewart's parents were compensated $1.7 million for their child's death. Stewart's death would be remembered as an egregious tragedy of police abuse.\n\nA grand jury investigation was initiated in October 1983 to determine what happened to Stewart in the 32 minutes between being arrested and his delivery to the hospital. On October 19, about twenty black community leaders, including City Councilwoman Mary Pinkett, protested outside the Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau’s office at the Criminal Court Building. Morgenthau refused to see the group stating that it would be inappropriate to comment before the case went to the grand jury in November 1983. The medical examiner’s final report, issued on November 2, differed from his preliminary report. Gross declined to state explicitly what caused the death, but reported that Stewart died of “physical injury to the spinal cord in the upper neck” and concluded that there were “a number of possibilities as to how an injury of this type can occur”.\n\nDuring the five-month trial in the New York Supreme Court, some witnesses testified that Stewart was struck and kicked by officers, while other witnesses said they did not see officers beat Stewart. None were able to determine who was responsible for handling Stewart, and none were able to identify which officers took which actions at the arrest. Experts could not agree on what combination of injuries, intoxication, and cardiac health issues ended Stewart's life. Seven months into the grand jury investigation, the case was dismissed because a juror, Ronald P. Fields, initiated private investigations on the case.\n\nIn February 1984, a second grand jury introduced the case before Justice George F. Roberts which indicted three officers, John Kostick, Anthony Piscola and Henry Boerner, with criminally negligent homicide, assault and perjury. Three other officers, Sgt. Henry Hassler, Sgt. James Barry and Susan Techky, who denied that they saw officers kick Stewart, were charged with perjury. In June 1985, jury selection began in State Supreme Court in Manhattan for the trial.\n\nProsecutor Morgenthau went to the second trial with two theories, one of neck injury leading to the death and the other that beatings caused cardiac arrest. Prosecutors pushed for second degree manslaughter to be charged if it was determined the officers recklessly caused the death. The jury was instructed that to support a charge of criminally negligent homicide, they had to find that the officers failed to take reasonable steps to prevent death. The prosecution hoped to establish a law requiring officers to “have an affirmative duty to protect prisoners in their custody from abuse”.\n\nWilliam McKechnie, of the Transit Patrolman's Benevolent Association, denied the officers' role in the death stating, “If someone dies of a heart attack, we are not doctors”. The New York Civil Liberties Union believed the second set of indictments signaled a new direction in how prosecutors treat police abuse cases. Richard Emery a lawyer for the New York City Liberties Union, stated, “The theory underlining this case is perhaps the most important development in stemming the tide of police abuse. It makes police officers strictly responsible for their prisoners. It holds them accountable.” On November 24, 1985, the six officers were acquitted by an all-white jury.\n\nIn 1987, the 11 officers and the MTA were charged with a $40 million civil suit filed by the Stewart family which prompted hundreds of off duty transit police officers to march along Madison Avenue in front of the MTA's headquarters carrying signs reading “End the witch hunt” and “When are we finally innocent?” In August 1990, Stewart's parents and his siblings John and Lisha Cole Stewart settled the civil suit out of court for $1.7 million. As of 1990, the police and city officials stated they were not to blame for the death of Michael Stewart.\n\nFamily - Stewart's family called death an act of racism and brutality. Attorneys representing the Stewart family described Michael as “a retiring and almost docile 135-pound young artist and a Pratt Institute student” who was on his way home to his Clinton Hill, Brooklyn neighborhood where he lived with his mother, Carrie, and father, Millard, who was a retired Metropolitan Transit Authority maintenance worker. They maintained that the white officers had beaten a black artist and model. It stirred public protests by black activists and others, believing that city officials are covering up for the transit police.\n\nMTA - In March 1987, the MTA determined that only one officer, John Kostick, was subject to suspension based on departmental charges of perjury. The MTA Board approved additional training for transit officers in the handling of emotionally disturbed people and changed its policies on how the department's internal affairs unit becomes involved with cases of possible misconduct.\n\nTributes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7699758", "categories": ["20th-century American painters", "African-American artists", "New York City Police Department corruption and misconduct", "Crimes in New York City", "1983 in New York (state)", "American graffiti artists", "Deaths by person in the United States", "1958 births", "Criminal trials that ended in acquittal", "People from Brooklyn", "1983 deaths", "Deaths in police custody in the United States", "American male painters", "Victims of police brutality"], "title": "Death of Michael Stewart"}

He was an elder brother of Saint Gall.\n\nBorn in Leinster, Deicolus and his brother, Gall, studied at Bangor Abbey in County Down. He was selected to be one of the twelve followers to accompany St. Columbanus on his missionary journey. After a short stay in Great Britain in 576 he journeyed to Gaul and laboured with St. Columbanus in Austrasia and Burgundy.\n\nWhen St. Columbanus was expelled by Theuderic II, in 610, St. Deicolus, then eighty years of age, determined to follow his master, but was forced, after a short time, to give up the journey, and remained behind alone, establishing a hermitage at a nearby church dedicated to St Martin in a place called Lutre, or Lure, in the Diocese of Besançon, to which he had been directed by a swineherd.\n\nUntil his death, he became the apostle of this district, where he was given a church and a tract of land by Berthelde, widow of Weifar, the lord of Lure.

Numerous miracles are recorded of St. Deicolus, including the suspension of his cloak on a sunbeam and the taming of wild beasts.\n\nClothaire II, King of Burgundy, recognised the virtues of the saint and considerably enriched the Abbey of Lure, also granting St. Deicolus the manor, woods, fisheries, etc., of the town which had grown around the monastery. Feeling his end approaching, St. Deicolus gave over the government of his abbey to Columbanus, one of his young monks, and retreated to a little oratory where he died on 18 January, about 625.\n\nHis feast is celebrated on 18 January.

Her colorful character and her care for the sick and dying during the cholera epidemic of 1873 endeared her to the Birmingham community. The shocking true story of the Birmingham Madam The \"Lou Wooster Public Health Award\" is named in her honor.\n\nLouise Wooster was born in 1842 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama to William Wooster and Mary Chism Wooster. Her father died in 1851 and Mary Wooster remarried. A few years later, Lou's stepfather abandoned the family and took their money with him. Mary Wooster died a few years later virtually destitute.\n\nBy her middle teens, Lou was an orphan with nothing to rely on but the mercy of relatives. During this time, she was abused, attempted suicide, and her older sister became a prostitute. She later wrote that she \"fell, step by step, until at last I was beyond redemption\".\n\nIn 1873, Lou was a well paid lady of the evening when a deadly cholera epidemic swept through Birmingham. Several thousand people fled the city, but Lou stayed to nurse the sick, feed the hungry, and prepare the dead for funerals. After the epidemic, few of Lou's clients remained in Birmingham and she moved to Montgomery, Alabama to open a brothel.\n\nBy 1880, she had returned to Birmingham operating multiple brothels near City Hall where she could attract the wealthiest patrons. Lou made a fortune, donated heavily to charities and frequently came to the aid of fallen women.\n\nLou was a master at storytelling and self-promotion. She wrote a book chronicling her life titled \"Autobiography of a Magdalene\".\n\nLou died in 1913 and was buried in Birmingham's Oak Hill Cemetery.\n\nThe The Lou Wooster Public Health Award is presented annually by the University of Alabama School of Public Health to recognize individuals, groups, or organizations who are unconventional public health heroes. The award is named in honor of Lou Wooster, the 19th-century Birmingham madam who risked her own death by staying in the city to care for the sick and dying during the 1873 cholera epidemic. Lou Wooster organized the women in her brothel \"determined to stay and help nurse the poor sick and suffering ones who needed me.\" Her courage went a long way toward assuring there was a Birmingham for the leadership to come back to. When she died in May 1913, hundreds of empty black carriages drove by the funeral home to pay respects to a local hero. Recipients are driven by a horse-drawn carriage from the School of Public Health to Oak Hill Cemetery where Lou Wooster is buried.\n\nThe first award was presented in 2007 Representative Patricia Todd, MPA, who is also known as the first openly gay State Representative in Alabama. In 2010 the award was presented to American Electric Power for their efforts to work with environmental groups and other stakeholders to reduce pollution from power production. Master Chef Frant Stitt was recognized in 2011 for his work in improving nutrition by working on urban farms and creating new menus for University Hospital. In 2012 the VF Corporation was recognized for its decision to rebuild the Hackleburg, Alabama Wrangler Distribution Center destroyed by the April 27, 2011 tornado. Rebuilding this facility will have profound impacts on the long term health of the community.\n\n", "id": "7699785", "categories": ["American prostitutes", "People from Birmingham, Alabama", "1913 deaths", "American brothel owners and madams", "1842 births"], "title": "Louise Wooster"}

At the death of her husband Victor Amadeus I in 1637, she acted as regent of Savoy between 1637 and 1648.\n\nChristine was born in the Palais du Louvre in Paris, she was the third child and second daughter of King Henry IV of France and his second wife, the Italian Marie de' Medici. As a daughter of the king, she was a Daughter of France. She was a younger sister of Louis XIII of France and Elisabeth of France. She was also an older sister of Nicholas Henri, Duke of Orléans, Gaston, Duke of Orléans and Henrietta Maria of France. Christine was a sister-in-law of Philip IV of Spain through Élisabeth and of Charles I of England through Henrietta Maria. As a child, she was raised under the supervision of the royal governess Françoise de Montglat.\n\nAfter the marriage of her older sister Elisabeth in 1615 to the future Philip IV of Spain, Christine took on the honorary title of \"Madame Royale\" indicating her status as the eldest and most senior unmarried daughter at the court of her father. After her marriage, the style went to her younger sister Henrietta Maria of France.\n\nShe married Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy, on 10 February 1619 at the Louvre in the capital. From 1619 till her husband's accession, she was known as the Princess of Piedmont. He was a son of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy and Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain. Caterina Micaela was in turn a daughter of Philip II of Spain and Elisabeth of Valois. Elisabeth was a daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici. She was said to be volatile and frivolous. Educated at the French court, she introduced French culture to the court of Savoy; she later lived at the \"Palazzo Madama\" which she had rebuilt. She was also the driving force for the reconstruction of the Castello del Valentino as well as the additions to the Royal Palace of Turin. She would also later own \"Vigna di Madama Reale\", old residence of her brother in law Maurice of Savoy.\n\nShe did as much as she could to ensure that her court rivalled in splendour that of her sister Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England. The sisters would have somewhat of a rivalry. In spite of this, the two sisters maintained an avid correspondence throughout their life which showed their close relationship. She was a confidant to the exiled Queen Henrietta who often wrote to her about her experiences during the English Civil War and her son's restoration. Christine encouraged her husband to claim his right to the rather empty title of King of Cyprus and Jerusalem, a 'kingdom' which led to him being tagged as 'a king without a crown'. She did not keep it a secret that she would rather be a queen than a duchess; she also wanted to transform the minor Duchy of Savoy into a little France.\n\nVictor Amadeus became Duke after the death of his father on 26 July 1630. When her husband died in 1637, she was created regent in the name of her son Francis Hyacinth. At the death of Francis Hyacinth in 1638, her second son Charles Emmanuel II succeeded and Christine retained the regency. Both Prince Maurice and his younger brother Prince Thomas of Savoy disputed the power of their sister-in-law and her French entourage. When the first heir Francis Hyacinth died in 1638, both brothers started the Piedmontese Civil War, with Spanish support. The two parties were called \"\"principisti\"\" (supporters of the Princes) and \"\"madamisti\"\" (supporters of Madama Reale). Christine was notorious as much for her capricious rule as for her many lovers, a trait from her father Henry IV who was famed for his many lovers also.\n\nAfter four years of fighting, Christine was victorious, thanks to French military support. Not only did she keep the Duchy for her son, she also prevented France getting too much power in the Duchy. When peace was concluded in 1642, Maurice married his fourteen-year-old niece Louise Christine, abandoning the title of cardinal and asking dispensation from Pope Paul V. Maurice became governor of Nice. Christine of France stayed in firm control of the Duchy of Savoy, until her son could follow in her footsteps; her formal regency ended in 1648, but she remained in charge at his invitation until her death.\n\nShe lived an uninhibited private life and had relationships with the French Ambassador, Marini, her brother-in-law, Maurizio, and Count Filippo d'Aglié, a handsome learned and courageous man who remained faithful to her all her life. She encouraged her son Charles Emmanuel to marry her niece Françoise Madeleine d'Orléans, the youngest surviving daughter of Gaston, Duke of Orléans, her youngest brother. They married 3 Apr 1663.\n\nChristine died at the Palazzo Madama, Turin on 27 Dec 1663 at the age of 57 and was buried at the Basilica of Sant'Andrea. She had outlived 4 of her seven children.\n\nFrançoise Madeleine died in January 1664 and her son later married another cousin, Marie Jeanne of Savoy. Marie Jeanne would give birth to Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia who would later marry another French Princess (and member of the House of Orléans) Anne Marie d'Orléans. 17 years after her death, in 1680, her granddaughter \"Victoria of Bavaria\" via her third daughter Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy, would marry her older brother's grandson Louis de France known as 'the Fat' and \"Monseigneur\". Christine thus became a direct ancestress of the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon via Victoria's second son Philip V of Spain.\n\nIt was revealed on NBC's \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" that one of her descendants is model/actress Brooke Shields. Princess Michael of Kent, born Baroness Marie Christine, is also a descendant by Christine's son, Charles Emmanuel.\n\n\n", "id": "7699794", "categories": ["People from Paris", "17th-century women rulers", "17th-century French people", "House of Bourbon (France)", "1606 births", "1663 deaths", "Regents of Savoy", "Princesses of France (Bourbon)", "Duchesses of Savoy"], "title": "Christine of France"}

He made great strides in the 2008–09 season making a total of seven appearances in his first season as a professional, making his debut as a substitute for Orient in a home game against Doncaster Rovers on 19 April 2008. He was offered a new contract on 4 May 2009. On 11 May 2009, at the annual Leyton Orient awards dinner, Pires was awarded the inaugural Leyton Orient Community Player of the Year award for his outstanding contributions to the club's community sports programmes and youth schemes.\n\nDespite scoring 10 goals in 12 reserve games, Pires was unable to find a regular place in the first team and was released by Orient's manager Russell Slade on 9 May 2010.\n\nOn 19 July 2010, Pires signed for Conference South side Welling United. He suffered a knee injury on 10 August 2010 prior to the start of the Conference South season and was ruled out for four weeks. He was then ineligible to play for a further two weeks due to the club's transfer embargo. He scored a 30-yard free kick on his long-awaited debut against Woking on 18 September 2010, after coming on as a 75th minute sub. Pires and his teammates narrowly missed out on the play-offs but it was still deemed a successful season as the club had faced a points deduction and a transfer embargo. In total he made 27 appearances scoring nine goals. Pires also won the club's Goal of the Season award for his 30-yard spectacular volley against Bishop's Stortford. In his second season at Welling United, Pires played a key part in the club's run to the Conference South play-off final. In total he played 37 matches scoring 14 goals.

Nothing further is known with certainty about her life.\n\nHer name is how she is known in Anglo-Saxon. Some have suggested that it is a corruption of the British Aud Wyry (meaning \"Aud the Virgin\"), the name by which she is known in Brittany. However, since Aud Wyry simply means \"Aud the Virgin\" (Aud is a Germanic name used in Northern France and not a Celtic name) it is more likely that Aud Wyry is a Breton reinterpretation of her original name. She was said to have been the sister of Paul Aurelian, Sidwell of Exeter and Wulvela but this is hotly debated.\n\nThe legend of Saint Juthwara is known from John Capgrave's \"Nova Legenda Angliae\", after John of Tynemouth mid-14th century. According to this, she was a pious girl who was the victim of a jealous stepmother. She prayed and fasted often, and frequently gave alms. Upon the death of her father, she began to suffer a pain in her chest. Its source was ascribed to her sorrow and austerities. As a remedy, her stepmother recommended two soft cheeses be applied to her breasts, telling her own son, Bana, that Juthwara was pregnant. Bana felt her underclothes and found them moist, whereupon he immediately struck off her head. A spring of water appeared at the spot. Juthwara then miraculously picked up her head and carried it back to the church. Bana repented of his deed and became a monk, founding a monastery of Gerber (later known as Le Relecq) on a battlefield.\n\nJuthwara's death took place at \"Halyngstoka\", generally accepted as Halstock in Dorset, where she is known as Juthware, and where local tradition points to a field still called by her name, modernised to 'Judith'. Baring-Gould and Fisher suggested instead Lanteglos-by-Camelford in North Cornwall where the church is now named for Saint Julitta, but may have originally borne Juthwara's name. At Laneast ten miles to the east the church is dedicated to her sisters, but this has apparently arisen by a modern confusion between Laneast and Gulval (also known as Lanestly): at Laneast the dedication in 1436 was to SS. Sativola and Thomas the Martyr, Wolvela does not appear until George Oliver's \"Monasticon\".\n\nIn July 2012, Halstock's Parish church of St Mary had its dedication extended to include St Juthware, in recognition of the local tradition.\n\nJuthwara's feast day is 18 November. Her translation is generally held to be 13 July, although one source gives 6 January. Her body was translated to Sherborne Abbey in the early 11th century and her shrine remained a place of pilgrimage there until the Dissolution. An illustration of her beheading appears in the Sherborne Missal.\n\nJuthwara is depicted in the Great East Window of Sherborne Abbey, and on a number of altar screens in Devon, in company with her sister Sidwell. Her traditional emblem is a round soft cheese and/or a sword. She is depicted as a cephalophore in a late medieval statue in Guizeny, in Brittany.\n", "id": "7699856", "categories": ["Cephalophores", "Southwestern Brythonic saints", "6th-century Christian martyrs", "Burials at Sherborne Abbey"], "title": "Juthwara"}

Some mandolin orchestras use guitars and double-basses instead of, or as well as, the lower mandolin-family instruments.\n\nA mandolin orchestra is an ensemble of plucked string instruments similar in structure to the string sections of a symphony orchestra. There are first and second mandolin sections (analogous to first and second violins); a mandola section (analogous to the viola section); mandocelli (analogous to the violincelli), classical guitars, and a bass section originally of mando-basses but nowadays more likely to be acoustic bass guitar or double bass.\n\nThe classical guitar section is very important and many orchestras are more accurately described as mandolin and guitar orchestras. Many orchestras also include a percussion section.\n\nMost mandolin orchestras are community-based and are supported by a core of professional musicians and teachers with a passion for plucked string instruments and music. They are found in nearly all major cities in the western world, as well as Japan, Korea, and South America.\n\nThe stimulus to create mandolin groups often came from travelling mandolinists and teachers. Immigration from Europe to other parts of the world resulted in the concept spreading rapidly, with movements beginning quite early in the USA, Japan and Australia. Some indication of the speed of these developments across the globe can be appreciated by the following:\n\nOn reviewing the S.S. Stewarts \"Banjo and Guitar Journal\", later called \"Banjo, Guitar and Mandolin Journal\", between 1884 and 1900 one comes to a view, at least in the USA and Australia, that mandolin ensemble playing evolved within the banjo movement, eventually replacing it as the better ensemble instrument.\n\nMandolin orchestras were popular in the early 20th Century and many cities and schools had one. \nA considerable body of music was created, much of which was simple or popular marches and foxtrots that were easy and fun to play. However, some \"serious\" music was also created and which requires every bit as much skill to play as anything in the more well-known violin repertoire. Principal among the important composers of such music were Raffaele Calace, Arrigo Cappelletti, Giuseppe Manente and Carlo Munier, who all wrote beautiful and virtuosic music for various mandolin chamber music ensembles (mandolin and guitar, two mandolins and mandola, etc. as well as full orchestras).\n\nAfter World War I, the mandolin orchestras went into a period of decline in the US. Orchestras continued to exist in Japan, and Germany where they are known as Zupforchester, and also in Italy.\n\nIn Canada, new mandolin orchestras were organized in Toronto, Winnipeg and other cities by left-wing immigrants from Eastern Europe. Frequently performing in labour halls, these groups were sometimes under government scrutiny, suspected of spreading socialist propaganda. Children's orchestras were also formed in Ukrainian communities.\n\nThe New York Mandolin Orchestra continued to perform during World War II.\n\nInterest in the mandolin was renewed as a part of the resurgent interest in folk music in the late 1950s and 1960s. As this music began to be re-discovered, orchestras began to form anew in large cities in the US.\n\nIn the modern era, many cities in the US host mandolin orchestras of many years experience; many have libraries of hundreds of compositions. Significant new music continues to be written all over the world by composers including Victor Kioulaphides, John Craton, Annette Kruisbrink, Clarice Assad, Francine Trester and Jeff Hijlkema.\n\n\n", "id": "7699888", "categories": ["Mandolin family instruments"], "title": "Mandolin orchestra"}

His father, Umer Hayat (born January 5, 1958), was born in Pakistan and emigrated to the United States in 1976; he is a naturalized American citizen. Together they were the subjects of the first terrorism trial in the state of California. Both were alleged to be part of, or associated with, a terrorist sleeper cell.\n\nIn 2019, a judge recommended their conviction be overturned, citing an ineffective legal defense for Hayat - who was defended by a lawyer that had never previously served in a criminal case in a federal court.The recommendation also cites a coerced confession obtained by the FBI, which one former agent described as the “sorriest confession” he had ever seen.\n\nIn June 2005 Hamid Hayat was arrested and charged with providing material support to terrorists, and of lying about it to FBI agents. The prosecution alleged that Hamid Hayat had spent the better part of two years at an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan, returning in 2005 with an intent to attack civilian targets in the United States. The defense contended that Hayat was in Pakistan to engage an arranged marriage. On April 25, 2006, a jury voted to convict Hamid Hayat of one count of providing material support or resources to terrorists and three counts of making false statements to the FBI in matters related to international or domestic terrorism. The maximum penalty for these charges is 39 years of imprisonment. Sentencing was set for July 14, 2006, before U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr.\n\nHis father, Umer Hayat, was also arrested and charged with two counts of making false statements to the FBI regarding the investigation of his son and of certain members of the Muslim community of Lodi. Umer's charges ended in a hung jury. When faced with a retrial for the same offenses, he pled guilty in exchange for a release with time served.\n\nThe younger Hayat's conviction is controversial in some circles. Supporters of the Hayats believe them to be innocents railroaded by overzealous FBI agents and post-9/11 Islamophobia. They cite the occasionally outlandish nature of the confessions, especially Umer's, in particular where he describes a supposed al-Qaeda training camp populated by a thousand men doing \"pole vault\" practice in ninja masks (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle masks, according to the Los Angeles Times).\n\nHamid Hayat's attorney, Wazhma Mojaddidi, also claims that he had been worn down by the FBI's five-hour interrogation and confessed to crimes he did not commit. Hamid and Umer Hayat's separate, videotaped confessions were the linchpin of the government's case. Former FBI agent James Wedick Jr., a veteran of 35 years, believed the confessions had been coaxed with intimidation and leading questions. Wedick was never allowed to testify and present his analysis of the confession videotapes at Hamid Hayat's original trial. Prior to being contacted by defense attorneys for Hamid Hayat, Wedick had had no knowledge of or involvement with the case.\n\nThe government argued that there is a greater pattern at work. A government informant taped him saying, in regard to the murder of Daniel Pearl by Pakistani terrorists: \"They killed him. So I'm pleased about that. They cut him into pieces and sent him back. That was a good job they did. Now they can't send one Jewish person to Pakistan.\" FBI agents also recovered from his room jihadist magazines (e.g. of the Jaish-e-Mohammed) and a \"jihad scrapbook\" containing articles praising the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. Hamid also carried in his wallet a supposed \"jihadi supplication\" reading \"O Allah we place you at their throats and we seek refuge in you from their evils.\"\n\nMuch was made of how Umer Hayat seemed to possess sums of cash unusual for an ice-cream-truck driver with only an 8th grade education (e.g. a $390,000 home with no outstanding debt). According to U.S. District Court Judge Garland Burrell, Hayat \"appears to have access to a significant amount of cash from an unexplained source.\"\n\nThere is also a tenuous family connection to radical Islam: Umer's father-in-law, Hamid's maternal grandfather, is a prominent leader in the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, a conservative, strictly religious political party in Pakistan strongly associated with the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n\nPreviously, on April 19, 2003, father and son had been stopped at Dulles International Airport on the way to Pakistan. They were attempting to illegally carry $28,093 in cash out of the country. According to the defense, this was money they had saved to build a vacation home in Pakistan and to pay for Hamid's wedding and the wedding of his sister.\n\nAfter his initial conviction Hamid Hayat sought a new trial, for which his attorneys, Wazhma Mojaddidi and Dennis Riordan, filed a motion on the grounds of misconduct by jury foreman Joseph Cote as well as other court misconduct. Cote allegedly used racial slurs during the trial and compared Hayat to the Pakistani men who had conducted the recent terrorist attacks in London (see 7 July 2005 London bombings and 21 July 2005 London bombings). Cote also contacted an excused alternative juror during deliberations.\n\nThe hearing was held on April 6, 2007. On May 17, 2007, U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. rejected a new trial for Hamid Hayat, writing in his ruling that the reports of juror misconduct were not credible. Hamid Hayat's defense attorney, Wazhma Mojaddidi, announced plans to appeal.\n\nOn September 10, 2007, Hamid Hayat was sentenced to 24 years in federal prison. It was his 25th birthday. In the words of Federal Judge Garland Burrell Jr., Hayat had re-entered the U.S. \"ready and willing to wage violent jihad.\"\n\nThe Hamid Hayat case is seen as an example of a pre-crime conviction (McCulloch and Wilson 2016). The dissenting Judge Tashima in Hayat's unsuccessful appeal argued he would reverse the conviction \"because the judicial branch's constitutional duty to do justice in criminal prosecutions was not fulfilled in this case in which the government asked a jury to deprive a man of his liberty largely based on dire, but vague, predictions that the defendant might commit unspecified crimes in the future\" (United States v Hayat 2013: 4, 59, emphasis in original). Judge Tashima acknowledged that the law permitted conviction on the basis that the defendant might commit such unspecified crimes in the future, but argued that when the law allows for such convictions every aspect of the trial should be scrupulously fair, and that Hayat's trial did not meet this standard. The majority likewise described the government's \"preventative approach\" as \"one that permits the conviction of potential terrorists who may never in fact have committed any terrorist act if not arrested and convicted\" (United States v Hayat 2013: 24).\n\n\n", "id": "7699896", "categories": ["Living people", "1983 births", "People convicted of making false statements", "American people of Pakistani descent", "People convicted on terrorism charges"], "title": "Hamid and Umer Hayat"}

The representatives from its five founding members (the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia) were divided into three geographical areas: Europe, Asia-Pacific and North America, each of which actively regulates medical devices using their own unique regulatory framework. Founded in 1992, the GHTF was created in “an effort to respond to the growing need for international harmonization in the regulation of medical devices.\"\n\nThe GHTF disbanded late in 2012. Its mission has been taken over by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), a successor organization composed of officials from regulatory agencies— not industry — around the world. The GHTF website is no longer operational.\n\nAs quoted from the GHTF site now (IMDRF), “The purpose of the GHTF is to encourage the convergence in regulatory practices related to ensuring the safety, effectiveness/performance and quality of medical devices, promoting technological innovation and facilitating international trade, and the primary way in which this is accomplished is via the publication and dissemination of harmonized guidance documents on basic regulatory practices. These documents, which are developed by four different GHTF Study Groups, can then be adopted/implemented by member national regulatory authorities.\n\nThe GHTF also serves as an information exchange forum through which countries with medical device regulatory systems under development can benefit from the experience of those with existing systems and/or pattern their practices upon those of GHTF Founding Members.”\n\nStated succinctly, the organization aims to standardize medical device regulations around the world by exchange of information.\n\nThe founding members consist of regulatory authorities or industry members from the EU, the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada because of their well established and high standards in medical device regulations. Members also participate in the steering committee, which can recommend the inclusion of other participants in Study Groups to be a part of all GHTF activities.\n\nParticipating members consist of representatives from regulatory agencies or medical device trade associations not a part of the founding members. Participating members are to facilitate the adoption of as much of the GHTF’s policies in their region/agency as possible within legal parameters. Participating members can also take part in Study Groups as well as other expert working groups.\n\nLiaison bodies are public health organizations, international standard-setting bodies or other groups who can contribute to or benefit from participation in GHTF. Liaison Bodies are encouraged to promote GHTF guidelines to their members and incorporate them into their work. Liaison bodies are permitted to nominate observers for GHTF Study Groups and other expert working groups.\n\nObservers must be nominated by members and approved by the Study Group Chair. The level of participation that an Observer is granted is also decided by the Study Group Chair.\n\nThe purpose of the Steering Committee is to provide policy and direction for the GHTF. It is responsible for the assignment and oversight of new work items, adopt and monitor GHTF guidance documents and the authorization and promotion of GHTF training events.\n\nThe Steering Committee members consist of up to 8 members from each of the Founding Members’ regions. Of the 8 members, up to 4 may be from the regulatory sectors and up to 4 from the industry sectors. The Chain and Vice Chair members of the controlling region are not to be included in this number.\n\nThere are five study groups in the GHTF, each with a different focus. The size of each Study Group is to be determined by the Study Group Chair. Recommended members include one participant from each region with founding member status as well as appropriate numbers from regulatory agencies and industry technical experts.\n\nStudy Group 1 is concerned with the current medical device regulatory systems. From examining the current field, the group isolates the principles suitable for harmonization as well as those that pose a threat to harmonization. The Group also deals with the standardization of pre-market submissions and product labeling.\n\nExamples of documents put out by Study Group 1 include Principles of Medical Devices Classification, and Labeling for Medical Devices.\n\nStudy Group 2 is concerned with medical device vigilance such as medical device reporting and post market surveillance. The Group is designed to harmonize the data collection and reporting systems of the industry.\nExamples of documents put out by Study Group 2 include Medical Devices Post Market Surveillance: Content of Field Safety Notices, Manufacturer's Trend Reporting of Adverse Events and National Competent Authority Report Exchange Criteria including reference to the use of the GMDN.\n\nStudy Group 3 is concerned with examining and harmonizing current quality systems requirements.\nExamples of documents put out by Study Group 3 include Implementation of Risk Management Principles and Activities Within a Quality Management System and Quality Management Systems - Process Validation Guidance.\n\nStudy Group 4 is concerned with examining current quality systems auditing practices and the harmonization of the auditing process.\nExamples of documents put out by Study Group 4 include Training Requirements for Auditors and Guidelines for Regulatory Auditing of Quality Management.\n\nStudy Group 5 is concerned with the convergence of clinical practices. This includes the harmonization of clinical terms, reports and evaluations.\nStudy Group 5 has yet to produce any final documents, but areas of proposed topics include Clinical Evaluation and Clinical Evidence.\n\nThe Study Group Chair member is appointed for a three-year term by the Steering Committee. Upon completion of the term, the Chair is re-evaluated by the Steering Committee based on the needs of the Study Group.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699963", "text": "West Virginia coal wars\n\nThe West Virginia coal wars (1912–21), also known as the mine wars, arose out of a dispute between coal companies and miners. \n\nThe first workers strike, in West Virginia, was the Cabin Creek and Paint Creek strike of 1912-1913. With help from Mary \"Mother Jones\" Harris Jones, an important figure in unionizing the mine workers, the miners demanded better pay, better work conditions, the right to trade where they pleased (ending the practice of forcing miners to buy from company-owned stores), and recognition of the United Mine Workers (UMW).\n\nThe mining companies refused to meet the demands of the workers and instead hired Baldwin-Felts agents equipped with high-powered rifles to guard the mines and act as strikebreakers. After the Agents arrived, the miners either moved out or were evicted from the houses they had been renting from the coal companies, and moved into coal camps that were being supported by the Union. Approximately 35,000 people lived in these coal camps. \n\nA month after the strike began, hostilities began with the arrival of the Baldwin-Felts Agents who provoked the miners. Socialist Party activists began supplying miners with weapons: 6 machine guns, 1,000 high-powered rifles, and 50,000 rounds of ammunition. \n\nOn September 1, 1912, approximately 6,000 unionized miners from across the Kanawha River crossed the river and declared their intent to kill the mine guards and destroy the company operations. Due to this threat, the mining companies deployed additional armed guards and awaited the miners' attack. Consequently, the Governor proclaimed martial law to be in effect on September 2, 1912, seizing 1,872 high-powered rifles, 556 pistols, 6 machine guns, 225,000 rounds of ammunition, and 480 blackjacks - as well as large quantities of daggers, bayonets, and brass knuckles.\n\nOn May 19, 1920, a shootout in Matewan, West Virginia, between agents of the Baldwin-Felts and local miners, who later joined the United Mine Workers of America, sparked what became known as the Battle of Blair Mountain, the largest insurrection in the United States since the American Civil War.\n\nWest Virginia had only a few active coal mines during the US Civil War, with fewer than 1,600 miners in the whole state. Coal mining would flourish, however, between 1880 and 1900, after competing railroad companies began carving routes through the mountains of Appalachia. West Virginia produced 489,000 tons of coal in 1869, 4,882,000 tons of coal in 1889, and 89,384,000 tons of coal in 1917. The quick expansion of mining in West Virginia prompted many mining companies to construct company towns, in which mining companies own many, if not all housing, amenities, and public services. Miners were often paid in \"coal scrip\", paper notes issued by mining companies that could only be redeemed at company-owned stores in company towns.\n\nMining is a dangerous profession overall, but between 1890 and 1912, West Virginia mines had the highest miner death rates in the country. During World War I, West Virginia miners faced higher death rates than even soldiers in the American Expeditionary Force fighting in Europe.\n\nSome West Virginian coal miners joined the United Mine Workers (UMW) in response to wage reductions following The Panic of 1893. By 1902, UMW membership in West Virginia had reached 5,000 miners. Union membership among West Virginia coal miners remained low, however, especially in southern parts of the state.\n\nUMW had a strong, if isolated, presence in the Paint Creek area, and most miners there were unionized. In March 1912, Paint Creek UMW miners attempted to renegotiate their contracts for higher pay and automatic union dues. In response, a number of Paint Creek mines withdrew their recognition of UWM.\n\nOn April 18, 1912, union and non-union miners from Paint Creek, as well as 7,500 miners from the previously non-union Cabin Creek, Kanawha, and Fayette counties, went on strike. The UMW set up tent camps for miners and their families who had often been evicted without warning. UMW Vice-President Frank Hayes and the well-known labor activist Mary \"Mother\" Jones even visited the state to pledge their support.\n\nMining companies in the Paint Creek area hired strikebreakers and armed guards to suppress the strike, including 300 agents from the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency. Striking miners and their families were prohibited from using company bridges and roads, as well as utilities like running water. Company guards killed several miners over the first few months of the strike, and constructed a machine gun equipped armored train known as the \"Bull Moose Special\", which they used to fire upon the tent camps of striking workers. Miners, with the support of Mother Jones and the Socialist Party of America, acquired weapons and retaliated against the mining company guards.\n\nIn September, 1912, West Virginia Governor William E. Glasscock declared martial law and sent 1,200 state troops to confiscate weapons and ammunition attempted to quell the rising tensions between miners and mining companies. While the declaration of martial law did reduce armed conflict in the winter of 1912-1913,\n\nIn April, 1913, UMW officials presented the Paint Creek mining companies with a compromise deal, leaving out some miner demands but maintaining support for a 9-hour workday, accountability for miner compensation, and protection from backlash for union membership. After nearly a full year of work stoppages and fighting, the mining companies accepted the UMW compromise, which was enforced by West Virginia state soldiers.\n\nOn April 22 and 23, 1920, between 275 and 300 miners in Matewan, Mingo County joined the United Mine Workers of America. In retaliation, the Burnwell Coal and Coke Company fired all union-aligned miners and gave them three days to leave their company-owned residences. On April 27, 1920, Mingo County officials arrested Baldwin-Felts agent Albert C. Felts, who would later be involved in the Matewan shootout, for illegally evicting miners of the Burnwell Coal and Coke Company as punishment for union activity. Mingo County Sheriff G. T. Blankenship negotiated with miners groups that as long as only Mingo County officials enforced the eviction notices, the miners would peacefully comply. Miners in Mingo County continued to join the UMWA. A May 6, 1920 United Mine Workers meeting drew 3,000 attendees. By May 17, 1920, the UMWA set up a tent colony for evicted miners outside of Matewan.\n\nOn May 19, 1920, thirteen agents of the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency returned to Matewan to evict miners from Stone Mountain Coal Corporation housing. The Baldwin-Felts agents were challenged by Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield and Matewan Mayor Cabel Testerman, who contested the agents' authority in the town. The Baldwin-Felts agents persisted, however, based on permission from a local justice of the peace. Baldwin-Felts agents carried out their evictions under watch of a crowd of miners and their families. Hearing of the trouble stirring in Matawen, miners from surrounding areas armed themselves and made their way to the town in case of a larger conflict.\n\nAs the Baldwin-Felts agents were headed to the train station to depart Matewan, they were confronted once more by Police Chief Sid Hatfield, Mayor Cabel Testerman. Both Hatfield and Baldwin-Felts agent Albert Felts reported that they had warrants for the others arrest.\n\nAccounts of the May 19th shootout itself differ. Some reports indicate that Baldwin-Felts agents attempted to arrest Sid Hatfield, and shot Mayor Testermen when he intervened on Hatfield's behalf. Other's indicate that Hatfield initiated the violence, either by firing himself or by signalling a prepared ambush. In either case, the shootout resulted in 10 dead: Mayor Testerman, 2 miners, and 7 Baldwin-Felts agents, including Baldwin-Felts Agency Chief Thomas Felts' younger brothers, Albert and Lee.\n\nSupport for unionization in Mingo County increased after the Matewan Shootout. By July 1, 1920, in the county had unionized and joined the UWM strike. Miners and mine guards engaged in several armed skirmishes over the closure of coal mines and access to rail routes in the summer and fall of 1920. The West Virginia government declared martial law and sent federal troops to quell the strike, but backed down under threat of a general strike of all union coal miners in West Virginia.\n\nBaldwin-Felts Agency Chief Thomas Felts hired a team of lawyers to prosecute a case against Sid Hatfield and fifteen other men alleged to have participated in the Matewan Shootout, specifically on the charge of murdering Albert Felts. All sixteen men were, however, acquitted by a Mingo County jury. Shortly thereafter, the West Virginia State Legislature passed a bill allowing criminal cases to be prosecuted with juries summoned from another county. Murder charges were renewed, only this time for the deaths of the other 6 Baldwin-Felts agents.\n\nSid Hatfield and his deputy Ed Chambers were also brought up on charges of destroying the Mohawk mining camp in McDowell County. On August 1, 1921, Hatfield, Chambers, and their wives traveled unarmed to the McDowell County courthouse to stand trial. Upon reaching the courthouse, Hatfield and Chambers were shot and killed by waiting Baldwin-Felts agents. Miners in West Virginia were outraged at the deaths of Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers. In the weeks following the August 1st assassinations, miners organized and armed themselves across West Virginia.\n\nFrom August 20, 1921, miners began rallying at Lens Creek, approximately ten miles south of West Virginia state capital of Charleston. Estimates of total numbers vary, but on August 24, between 5,000 and 20,000 miners began marching from Lens Creek into Logan County, West Virginia. Many of the miners were armed, and some acquired weapons and ammo from the towns along the march's path.\n\nLogan County Sheriff Don Chafin had assembled a fighting force of approximately 2,000 county police, state police, state militia, and Baldwin-Felts agents to stop the approaching miners in the mountain range surrounding Logan County. On August 25, the miners began arriving in the mountains surrounding Logan, and fighting began between the two forces. Though Sheriff Chafin commanded fewer men, they were equipped with machine guns and rented aircraft, from which they dropped rudimentary bombs on the attacking miners.\n\nOn August 30, 1921, President Warren G. Harding declared martial law for the entire state of West Virginia and 2,500 federal troops arrived on September 2, bringing with them machine guns and military aircraft armed with surplus explosive and gas bombs from the recently concluded World War I. Facing a large and well equipped fighting force, the miners were forced to stand down.\n\nThough the battle ended in clear defeat for the pro-union miners, they gained some press support in the following years. Approximately around 550 miners and labor activists were convicted of murder, insurrection, and treason for their participation in the march from Lens Creek to Logan County and the ensuing Battle of Blair Mountain. Press support did not extend to union growth; UMW membership in West Virginia dropped by about half between 1921 and 1924.\n\nThe Matewan shootout is re-enacted annually in Matewan, West Virginia.\n\nJohn Sayles dramatized the events of the Matewan shootout in his 1987 film \"Matewan\".\n\nA documentary named \"The Mine Wars\" was made about these events for PBS and was originally aired on the network January 26, 2016. Narrated by actor Michael Murphy, it used archival material and interviews to convey the story as part of their ongoing American Experience series. \n\nThe West Virginia Mine Wars Museum, located in downtown Matewan, offers artifacts and interpretations of the events. The building that houses the museum still bears the scars of bullet holes from the Matewan Massacre.\n\n", "id": "7699963", "categories": ["Mining in West Virginia", "1921 in West Virginia", "1920 in the United States", "Appalachian society", "Labor disputes in West Virginia", "Riots and civil disorder in West Virginia", "1920 in West Virginia", "Coal mining in Appalachia", "Coal Wars", "1920s in West Virginia", "United Mine Workers", "Miners' labor disputes", "Labor-related violence in the United States", "1920 labor disputes and strikes", "1921 labor disputes and strikes"], "title": "West Virginia coal wars"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699979", "text": "Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales\n\nThe Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales (MSFS), also known as the Fransalians, was founded in Annecy, France on 24 October 1838 by Fr. Peter Mermier under the patronage of St. Francis de Sales. The political disturbances in the country, especially the French Revolution had its impact in the spiritual realm too as it left the people in a deep spiritual crisis and indifference towards their religious duties. Sensing the signs of the time Fr. Mermier took upon himself the task of a spiritual renewal in his people by preaching parish missions. This special apostolate in turn gave rise to a community of preachers gathered around Fr. Mermier.\n\nIt was founded in response to the desire of St. Francis de Sales to found a society of missionary priests. Nearly two centuries after the saint's death, Monsignor Joseph Rey, a successor of the Saint in the See of Annecy, broached the subject of such a society to Father Peter Mermier, who had been considering the same idea. Accordingly, Father Mermier put the design into execution.\n\nIn 1830 the institute was formed with La Feuillette as the site for the mother-house. This was solemnly blessed by the bishop on 8 August 1837, and the congregation canonically instituted by him on 8 October 1838. The society was not to be a mere association of priests, but a new religious congregation, bound by simple vows. Hence Father Mermier, the first superior-general, offered himself and his companions to the Pope for foreign missions. In 1845 his offer was accepted by Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, and the first missionaries of St. Francis de Sales set out for India.\n\nThe work has prospered and since that time more than 100 priests and seminarians have been sent out by the congregation, besides many lay brothers. More than 200 nuns of different orders have gone out at the call of the missionaries to help them. The first batch of the Fransalians (MSFS) landed in Pondichery on 8 September 1845 and the first batch of the Fransalians reached Visakhapatnam on 19 February 1846. The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples entrusted the Vicariate of Visakhapatnam to the Fransalians on 2 May 1848. Until 1888 there was only one region of the Fransalians in India: Visakhapatnam Region. In 1888 Nagpur region was created by bifurcating the Visakhapatnam region. Both were raised to the status of province in 1965. \nThe dioceses of Nagpur and Visakhapatnam have always been governed by prelates belonging to this institute. In Visakhapatnam the first vicar apostolic was Mgr Neyret (1850); he was succeeded by Mgr Tissot, first bishop of the diocese. The first bishop of Nagpur was Mgr Riccaz; after him came Mgr. Pelvat, a great supporter of the Indian way of religious life and Indian Theology developed by Brahmabandhab Upadyay (1861 -1907), followed by Mgrs. Crochet, Bonaventure, and Coppel.\n\nThe Fransalians in France and Switzerland were directly under the Superior General until 1959. It became a region in 1960 and a province in 1965.\n\nThe Fransalians went to England in 1861. England became a region of the Fransalians in 1940 and a province in 1965. In England the fathers have three missions in the Diocese of Clifton. Since the persecution of 1903, the congregation has been obliged to leave Savoy for England, where the juvenate, the novitiate, and the house of studies are successfully carried on.\n\nThe mission in Brazil was begun in 1926. The Province of Brazil was established in 1965. In 1975 the Fransalians of the Visakhapatnam Province entered the North-East India for evangelization. In 1984 the vice-province of NE India was erected and later in 1990 it was raised to the status of a province.\n\nFollowing the original vision of the Founder, the Servant of God, Fr Mermier, the Fransalians entered the African Continent in 1988. The mission began in Tanzania and the Province of East-Africa comprising Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, in 1996.\n\nAn autonomous American Mission in the US was founded in 1990 and later raised to the Status of a Region under the Superior General on 3 July 2007.\n\nThe South-West India Province was established in 1991 bifurcating the Visakhapatnam Province. The Visakhapatnam Province was further bifurcated to form the Tamil Nadu - Pondichery region under the Visakhapatnam Province on 24 January 2005. Three years later this region was raised to the status of a Province with a new name, Chennai Province on 24 January 2008 and in the same year on 15 August 2008, it was renamed as South-East Province. The Nagpur Province which was established in 1965 was later renamed Mahrarashtra-Goa Province. It was bifurcated in 1996 and the present Nagpur and Pune provinces were erected.\n\nThe superiors-general since the foundation have been the Very Reverend Fathers Mermier, Gaiddon, Clavel, Tissot, Gojon, and Bouvard.\n\n\n", "id": "7699979", "categories": ["Religious organizations established in 1838", "Salesian Order"], "title": "Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700069", "text": "Swedish ballad tradition\n\nThe Swedish ballad tradition is the tradition of Swedish poetic singer-songwriters. This \"visa\" tradition should not be confused with traditional \"medieval\" Swedish ballads (\"medeltida ballader\"), which are representative of a typical tradition of Scandinavian ballads.\n\nThe Swedish ballad tradition today is both a respected art form and an important basis of the popular Swedish (and Scandinavian) sing-along tradition. The song type is typically known as \"visa\" in Swedish and troubadours in the genre are called \"vissångare\". In context, the Swedish word \"ballad\" is a subtype of \"visa\" that tells a story in many verses, similar to the medieval ballads, as opposed to for instance lyrical songs about the beauty of nature. The Swedish ballads can be performed to a big orchestra but are often sung to fairly simple accompaniment on guitar, or other instruments such as piano or accordion.\n\nThe genre started with Carl Michael Bellman in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, poetic songwriting fell into decline in favour of academic student choirs, until it was revived in the 1890s by Sven Scholander. Poets increasingly continued the tradition of having their poetry put to music to give it a wider audience. In the early 1900s, a lot of poetry of the 90s poets Gustaf Fröding and Erik Axel Karlfeldt had been put to music, and the popularity of those poets largely depended on the troubadours.\n\nBirger Sjöberg (1885–1929) was one of the early popular troubadours. Sjöberg published the poetry collection \"Frida's Book\" (\"Fridas bok\", 1922), a light and humorous story of the young \"Frida\". In 1926, he reinvented himself with \"Kriser och kransar\" (\"Crises and garlands\"), a much darker collection of poetry. It is regarded as the foremost collection of Swedish poetry of the 1920s.\nOne of the most renowned Swedish troubadours of the 20th century was Evert Taube (1890–1976). He established himself as a performing artist in 1920 and toured Sweden for about three decades. He is best known for songs about sailors, ballads about Argentina, and songs about the Swedish countryside.\n\nA poet who is known for songs is Nils Ferlin (1898–1961) who published six collection of poetry between 1930 and 1957. Ferlin melancholic but with a stinging irony, and very rhythmical which made them easy for friends and colleagues to put music to. The titles of some of the poems already from the start referred to them being sung as songs, such as \"En valsmelodi\" (which translates as \"A waltz tune\"), and the title of his first collection of poems, \"En döddansares visor\".\n\nOther well-known singer-songwriters in the Swedish ballad tradition after Evert Taube were Olle Adolphson (1934–2004) and Cornelis Vreeswijk (1937–1987). Vreeswijk's songs were initially leftist protest songs where he took upon himself to speak for the weaker men of society. After his death, Vreeswijk also gained appreciation for his poetic qualities.\n\nPerhaps the best-known contemporary troubadour is Lars Winnerbäck, whose folk-rock ballads, often infused with a poetic quality, mix a Christian socialist political message with a typically Swedish sensitivity to nature in the spirit of Vreeswijk, making him one of Sweden's most popular currently active musicians.\n\nThe Swedish ballad tradition has close similarities to the ballad tradition (also known as \"vise\") in Norway, with Alf Prøysen as an early and prominent, yet distinct, representative. The Swedish ballad tradition has also greatly inspired the modern ballad tradition in Norway, that started in the 1960s as a cultural movement known as \"visebølgen\" (\"the ballad wave\"). Some of its prominent representatives are Ole Paus, Lillebjørn Nilsen and Finn Kalvik.\n\n", "id": "7700069", "categories": ["Swedish literature"], "title": "Swedish ballad tradition"}

The Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel stood on the site before the casino was built. It is famous for its address of \"Park Place and the Boardwalk\", two locations popularized by the board game Monopoly. Bally's is one of the largest hotels on the boardwalk with nearly 1,169 rooms. Its Dennis Tower opened in 1921. In 1997, The Wild Wild West Casino was opened as an expansion of Bally's.\n\nIn 1977, Reese Palley and local attorney and businessman Martin Blatt bought the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel and planned to preserve the Blenheim half of the hotel, along with adjacent Dennis Hotel for his Park Place Casino. Palley was successful in getting the Blenheim part of the hotel placed on the National Register of Historic Buildings, while planning to raze the Marlborough to make way for a new modern hotel. However, he stepped aside after Bally Manufacturing purchased a controlling interest in the project. After Bally took control, it announced plans to raze the Marlborough, Blenheim, and the adjacent Dennis Hotel, despite protests, to make way for the new \"Bally's Park Place Casino and Hotel\". However, in an effort to offset costs and open the casino as soon as possible, the Dennis Hotel was retained to serve as the temporary hotel for Bally's until a new tower could be built.\n\nIn November 1978, Bally's demolished the Marlborough-Blenheim and quickly cleared the land to begin building the Bally's Park Place Casino. On December 30, 1979, the casino opened with the newly renovated Dennis serving as its hotel. In 1989, Bally's constructed a 750-room hotel tower in a modern style, with an exterior of light pink glass. On July 2, 1997, The Wild Wild West Casino opened as the second casino at Bally's. \nIn 2000, Bally's Park Place changed its name and became Bally's Atlantic City. The adjacent Claridge Hotel and Casino was purchased and incorporated into Bally's in 2003, and was renamed the Claridge Tower. The casino in the Claridge Tower was named The Ridge. The casino was renovated in 2008 from a standard casino floor to an upscale lounge-casino. \n\nIn 2005, Harrah's Entertainment (now Caesars Entertainment Corporation) purchased Bally's along with Caesars. The boardwalk side of Bally's was renovated in 2009. The facade of the Dennis Tower was refurbished and a row of shops between the Dennis Hotel and the boardwalk was demolished, which opened the plaza of the Dennis Tower to the boardwalk.\n\nIn 2012, The Ridge closed its gambling and food amenities. The tower's 500 hotel rooms continued to be used for Bally's guests until it was sold in 2013 to be reopened as the independent Claridge Hotel. \n\nIn October 2017, ownership of Bally's was transferred to Vici Properties as part of a corporate spin-off, and the property was leased back to Caesars Entertainment.\n\nThe two casinos at Bally's have over . of gaming space with over 5000 slot machines, Keno, and many table games, among other features. Recent developments include games which combine the features of live table games with those of slot machines: The multi-player Roulette automatically spins the ball, but the bet and payout function is mostly handle by computerized video terminals for each player. Also, in the Wild Wild West area, a video recorded \"blackjack dealer\" on a big TV screen \"deals\" as the player bet on a video terminal which shows their \"cards\" in a multi-player game. Bally's also has a sportsbook which offers sports betting. As provided by local and state law, there scattered areas where smoking is permitted, totaling 25% of the official gaming space. (Aside from this exception, smoking is banned by law throughout the rest of the casino and hotel). Under New Jersey law, persons under 21 years of age are not permitted to gamble. They may only pass through the main aisles of the casino when accompanied by someone over 21 years old to cross between hotel areas and exits, and may not stop or slow down to observe the games.\n\nBally's Atlantic City participates along with other Caesars Entertainment properties in the \"Caesars Rewards\" loyalty program for their players, guests, and other customers. Rewards are based on casino play, food/beverage/retail/hotel room/entertainment purchases, and other factors. There are four tiers of membership, increasing in status: Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Seven Star.\n\nOpened on July 2, 1997, as an expansion of Bally's Atlantic City, it was originally extensively themed to the American Old West, with waterfalls, faux gold mines, and a running stream. It is notable for being one of the only fully themed casinos on the East Coast. The exterior features a facade made to resemble an old western town, while the inside featured a large mountain and other western town facades. The western theme has since been toned down in favor of a party atmosphere in order to attract a younger demographic.\n\nRenovations to the Wild Wild West Casino began in June 2012 and were completed on February 21, 2014. The Virginia City Buffet was closed, and the casino floor area was reduced in size; for a period of time in 2012, all live table games and most slot machines were removed. Table games returned to the casino with the completion of renovations, occupying the newly renovated back area. A World Series of Poker-branded poker room allows simultaneous live and online play. A new stage for live entertainment was also part of the renovations.\n\nFurther renovations occurred in 2015 and 2016. The animatronic gold miner and large rock formation/waterfall near the main boardwalk entrance were removed; this space now features a large area for bands to perform, as well as some live table games. The only slot machines besides those in Coyote Kate's Slot Parlor are located near the new stage. The area between the stage and the far back poker rooms remains vacant, but plans may still be in the works for more to be added.\n\nOn President's Day weekend 2016, Bally's opened the new Boardwalk Saloon. The bar offers ceiling to floor windows with views of the boardwalk and beach and an entrance with accordion folding glass doors which can remain open for access to outdoor seating on the Boardwalk. It replaced the Rita's and the North entrance to the casino.\n\n\nBally's proper does not have an all-you-can-eat buffet, but it promotes the \"Palace Court Buffet\" on the 3rd level of its sister property Caesars Atlantic City, with which it shares an indoor connection. Complimentary buffets issued by Bally's Atlantic City are honored at Caesars Atlantic City.\n\nTaste of the Shore is a food court in the \"Gateway\" area between the hotel lobby and the Claridge Hotel.

When Franchione left and Mike Sherman took over, McGee had the chance to thrive in a pro-style offense his senior season. He fell short, however, due to a recurring shoulder injury. He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the 2009 NFL Draft in the fourth round with the 101st overall pick.\n\nMcGee was a three-year starter at quarterback for Class 3A Burnet, where he led his team to a 36-5 combined record, including a 28-2 mark as a junior and senior. He did not throw a single interception during the regular season of his senior year. In both of those seasons, he led his team to the 3A state finals. He finished his high school career with 8,256 passing yards and a 3A state-record 101 passing touchdowns. He was a two-time all-state selection and was named the 3A Offensive Most Valuable Player after his senior season.\n\nHe also played basketball and track and field, earning all-district honors in both. A straight-A student, McGee was Burnet's best student-athlete and graduated 9th in his senior class of over 250. He graduated high school a semester early.\n\nMcGee attended high school with former University of Texas wide receiver Jordan Shipley. They both still remain close friends and hunting partners.\n\nAfter redshirting the 2004 season, McGee played his debut game as an Aggie against SMU in 2005, compiling 3-of-3 passes for 56 yards in a 66–8 victory. He continued to play as a backup to starter Reggie McNeal in the games against Colorado, Oklahoma State, Texas Tech, and Oklahoma. He took over the starting role for the final two games of the season due to an injury to McNeal. In those two games, McGee rushed for 175 yards on 34 carries (5.1 per carry) and completed 9-of-29 passes for 83 yards, while leading the Aggies to 10 scoring opportunities on 19 drives. During the final matchup against Texas, though McGee outrushed Texas quarterback Vince Young 108 yards to 19, the Aggies lost 29–40 to the Longhorns.\n\nFor the 2005 season, McGee recorded 24-of-53 passes for 283 yards and two touchdowns and one interception in eight games. He rushed for 235 yards and two touchdowns on 43 carries (5.5 average).\n\nDuring the 2006 season, McGee started all 13 games, leading the team to a 9–4 record. He led the Aggies to a 12-7 victory over rival Texas with a rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter. The A&M victory helped end the hopes of the 2006 UT team at winning back-to-back Big 12 Conference championship and at a third consecutive Bowl Championship Series berth.\n\nDuring the 2006 season, McGee broke the A&M single-season completion record, successfully completing 62% of his passes, recording 12 touchdowns to only 2 interceptions.\n\nIn June 2007, McGee appeared on the cover of Dave Campbell's Texas Football alongside Texas quarterback Colt McCoy and TCU defensive end Tommy Blake.\n\nOn October 20, 2007, McGee was named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Week after rushing for 167 yards on 35 carries against Nebraska. McGee passed for a career-high of 362 yards in the 2007 Texas game, leading his team to a second consecutive victory over the Longhorns.\n\nIn the 2007 season, McGee contributed to 62 percent of the team's total offensive yards. He passed for 2,311 and rushed for 899 yards.\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, Mike Sherman took over as the Aggies' head coach. McGee competed for the starting job with sophomore Jerrod Johnson. He was named the starter for the season opener against Arkansas State on August 30, 2008. The Aggies lost the game 18–14. In the second game against New Mexico, McGee sprained his shoulder. Johnson replaced McGee for the remainder of the game. In the following game against Army, McGee re-aggravated his shoulder during the second quarter and likewise had to sit out for the rest of the game.\n\nMcGee did not see action in the following two games against Oklahoma State and Kansas State. In the Texas Tech game, he entered the field for one play, which he used to throw a 3-yard touchdown. Afterwards, he did not play in the victories against Iowa State and Colorado. He saw action in the home matchup against Oklahoma, which also happened to be Senior Day. He finished the game completing 10-of-19 passes for 82 yards. The Aggies lost to the Sooners 66–28. He played his last and final game against Texas, accumulating 16-of-24 passes for 207 yards, and 3 rushing attempts for a negative 20 yards in a 49–9 loss.\n\nAfter the season, McGee was named the 2008 winner of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes' National Bobby Bowden Award, which recognizes the \"student athlete who conducts himself as a faith model in the community, in the classroom and on the field\".\n\nIn the East–West Shrine Game on January 17, 2009, McGee shared the quarterback role for the West team, completing 9-of-14 passes for 128 yards and one touchdown in a 24–19 loss.\n\n\nAt the 2009 NFL Combine, McGee ran a 4.66-second 40-yard dash, which ranked second in his group. He came in 4th after recording 33.0 inches in the vertical jump, and 5th with his 9'4\" in the broad jump. He weighed 222 pounds and measured 6-foot-2⅞ at the Texas A&M Pro Day on March 4, 2009.\n\nIn the 2009 NFL Draft, McGee was picked by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (101st overall). He became the first quarterback drafted by the Cowboys since Quincy Carter in 2001, and the second since 1991. The Cowboys believed him to be a project player since he was mostly an option quarterback in college. However, they also believed he had a strong arm, the build, and the work ethic to succeed. He signed a four-year deal with the Cowboys on July 28, 2009.\n\nMcGee made his first start in the 2010 preseason finale against the Miami Dolphins, leading Dallas to a 27–25 victory over Miami's first-stringers, while completing 27-of-42 passes for 304 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions.\n\nAfter starter Tony Romo was placed on injured reserve in 2010, McGee became the Cowboys' second-string quarterback, behind Jon Kitna. During the 2010 Christmas Day game against the Arizona Cardinals, McGee replaced the injured Kitna in the second half, and made his first regular season touchdown pass. The touchdown gave the Cowboys a 26–24 lead with 1:47 remaining, but the Cardinals soon scored a field goal to win 27–26. McGee recorded 11-of-17 passes for 111 yards and a quarterback rating of 102.8. In the Cowboys' season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, McGee started his first NFL game. He went 11-27, 127 yards, and a touchdown pass to Jason Witten with 55 seconds left to give Dallas a 14-13 victory over their divisional rival.\n\nDuring the 2011 Christmas Eve 20–7 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, McGee replaced the injured Romo and completed 24-of-38 passes for 182 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions.\n\nOn September 1, 2012, he was waived before the start of the season.\n\nHe signed a Reserve/Future contract with the Houston Texans on January 24, 2013. He was released on August 26.\n\nOn September 25, 2013, he signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League, to serve as the backup for quarterback Henry Burris. He was declared a free agent at the end of the 2014 season.\n\nSources:</small>\n\nMcGee completed his undergraduate coursework in less than four years, receiving a B.B.A. in marketing from Mays Business School at Texas A&M University in August 2007.

His father was a plain farmer, and gave him an ordinary education. He early showed a mechanical aptitude, and at 14 was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker. Before his term was up, he purchased his freedom and established a cabinet making business in Northampton, Massachusetts. The business failed, and he moved to Springfield. There he endeavored to manufacture a gunpowder engine for propelling balloons; but this enterprise was also a failure. He next attempted to open steam navigation on Connecticut river between Hartford and Springfield, and would have succeeded if financial difficulties had not obliged him to cease operations before his steamer was completed.\n\nHe then invented a rag-cutting machine for paper mills. The invention was widely used, but Beach derived no pecuniary benefit due to his tardiness in applying for a patent. He then settled in Ulster County, New York, where he invested in an extensive paper mill. At first he was successful, and after six years was wealthy; but after seven years an imprudent investment dispersed his fortune, and he was compelled to abandon his enterprise.\n\nIn the meantime though, he had married the sister of the founder and proprietor of the \"New York Sun\", Benjamin Day. In 1835, he acquired an interest in the paper, then small, both in the size of its sheet and circulation. And with a $40,000 payment, he soon became sole proprietor.\n\nAccording to historian Elmo Scott Watson, Beach invented print syndication in 1841 when he produced a two-page supplement and sold it to a score of newspapers in the U.S. northeast.\n\nThe Associated Press was organized in May 1846 by Beach (at that time publisher of \"The Sun\"), joined by the \"New York Herald\", the \"New York Courier and Enquirer\", \"The Journal of Commerce\", and the \"New York Evening Express\". The AP was formed by the five New York daily papers to share the cost of transmitting news of the Mexican–American War.\n\nDuring the War, U.S. President James K. Polk sent Beach to Mexico to arrange a treaty of peace; but the negotiations were broken off by a false report announcing the defeat of General Zachary Taylor by Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna.\n\nBeach retired in 1857 with an ample fortune, and left the paper to his sons. He then returned to Wallingford.\n\nBeach was married twice and left five sons, Moses Sperry, Henry, Alfred Ely, Joseph and William, and one granddaughter, Emmeline, who married the naturalist and artist Abbott Handerson Thayer. She was the daughter of Moses Sperry Beach. She and her father are described in Mark Twain's \"The Innocents Abroad\".\n\n", "id": "7700153", "categories": ["19th-century American inventors", "Associated Press people", "19th-century American diplomats", "1800 births", "19th-century American journalists", "19th-century American newspaper publishers (people)", "Beach family", "American male journalists", "People from Wallingford, Connecticut", "1868 deaths"], "title": "Moses Yale Beach"}

It is also a parish in the \"Nätra Court District\".\n\nIn 1915 the parish comprised 39,416 hectares. By that time Sidensjö was a church district in the Diocese of Härnösand and the northwest deanery of Ångermanland. The parish of Sidensjö today includes 33 smaller villages and covers an area of 389 square kilometres.\n\nOn January 1, 1952 a joint municipality was formed from the parishes of Sidensjö and Nätra. It was called Nätra municipality and was included into the Örnsköldsvik municipality in 1971.\n\nSidensjö is situated by Lake Bysjön, 23 kilometres west of Örnsköldsvik in Ångermanland. Sidensjö houses 1,191 inhabitants (2004). At the beginning of the 1900s the number of inhabitants was as high as 2500. In the centre of Sidensjö are Sidensjöskolan (grades 1-6 and preschool), Sidensjö Sparbank (a free-standing Swedbank bank), a grocery store, an outdoor ice hockey rink, the Sidensjö IK football pitches and the service house Fyrklövern with an old people’s home and nursery school.\n\nAmong the things worth seeing is the Sidensjö church, which was built in the 14th century and with that is one of the oldest in the Örnsköldsvik municipality. The church foundation was renovated in the early 1900s and many skeletons were uncovered below the church floor. Among the people buried was an embalmed 19th century priest and in the sacristy a young woman was found.\n\nJust southeast of the church along road 908 towards Bjästa is the Sidensjö Village Hall where a café is open during summer. Next to the church is a hydroelectric power station that extracts energy from the Nätraån, a river with countless bends and sandbanks that is a popular place for canoe paddling. A popular tourist attraction is the “Bywatch” beach on the eastern shore of lake Bysjön along road 935 towards Örnsköldsvik, where there is a bridge, volleyball net and during summer a swim school.\n\nSidensjö has many active organizations and the biggest ones are IOGT-NTO (Swedish temperance organisation) and Sidensjö IK. Sidensjö IK is divided into several sections where the biggest ones are orienteering, cross-country skiing and football. In 1994 Sidensjö IK was responsible for organizing the first leg of the great orienteering competition called 'O-ringen 5-dagars'. The club was also the organizer of ‘Natt-SM in orienteering’ in 2004. During the 1980s Sidensjö had a women's football team participating in the Damallsvenskan national football league. The men’s team is, as of season 2007/2008, residing in Division 5. Youth activity has always been an important and major part in the club and this work has produced a number of players who now play in Division 2 Norrland.\n\nIn November 2003 Skanova installed ADSL in the Sidensjö telephone switch and is now available to most inhabitants through various ISPs.\n", "id": "7700170", "categories": ["Ångermanland", "Populated places in Örnsköldsvik Municipality"], "title": "Sidensjö"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700184", "text": "Common waxbill\n\nThe common waxbill (\"Estrilda astrild\"), also known as the St Helena waxbill, is a small passerine bird belonging to the estrildid finch family. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa but has been introduced to many other regions of the world and now has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km. It is popular and easy to keep in captivity.\n\nIt is a small bird, 4 to 5 inches in length with a wingspan of 4 1/2 inches and a weight of 3/5 to 3/4 ounce. It has a slender body with short rounded wings and a long graduated tail. The bright red bill of the adult is the colour of sealing wax giving the bird its name. The plumage is mostly grey-brown, finely barred with dark brown. There is a red stripe through the eye and the cheeks and throat are whitish. There is often a pinkish flush to the underparts and a reddish stripe along the centre of the belly depending on the subspecies. The rump is brown and the tail and vent are dark. Females are similar to the males but are paler with less red on the belly. Juveniles are duller with little or no red on the belly, fainter dark barring and a black bill.\n\nSimilar species include the black-rumped, crimson-rumped and black-lored waxbills. The black-rumped waxbill is black rather than brown on the rump and has a pale vent (area underneath the tail). The crimson-rumped waxbill has a dark bill, red rump and some red on the wings and tail. The black-lored waxbill (found only in the Democratic Republic of Congo) has a black rather than red stripe through the eye.\n\nThe common waxbill has a variety of twittering and buzzing calls and a distinctive high-pitched flight-call. The simple song is harsh and nasal and descends on the last note.\n\nThere are about 17 subspecies distributed widely across much of Africa south of the Sahara. They are present in most parts of East, Central and Southern Africa except for regions of desert or dense forest. In West Africa they are more local with the main population centred on Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Ivory Coast. Common waxbills inhabit open country with long grass and rank vegetation. They are often found near water in marshes and among reeds. They can be tame and will enter gardens, parks and farmland.\n\nBirds have often escaped from captivity or been deliberately released. Breeding populations have become established in many places where the climate is sufficiently warm and where there is a sufficient supply of grass seeds. They are now found on many islands around Africa: Saint Helena, Ascension Island, the Cape Verde Islands, São Tomé and Príncipe, Mauritius, Réunion, Rodrigues, the Seychelles and Ile Amsterdam. They may possibly be native on some of these islands. In Europe the common waxbill has become widespread in Portugal and is spreading through Spain. There are small populations on Madeira and Gran Canaria and it has recently appeared on Tenerife and the Azores. In the Americas waxbills are found in Trinidad, several parts of Brazil and there are a few on Bermuda. In the Pacific there are populations on New Caledonia, Efate Island in Vanuatu, Tahiti and the Hawaiian Islands. In Spain it has been introduced in the largest cities in the last ten years and is now quite commonly seen in Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, as well as along the Spanish-Portuguese border.\n\nThe nest is a large ball of criss-crossed grass stems with a long downward-pointing entrance tube on one side. It is built in a cavity, usually low down amongst dense vegetation. A rudimentary second nest (\"cock's nest\") may be built on top where the male sleeps. Four to seven white eggs are laid. They are incubated for 11 to 13 days and the young birds fledge 17 to 21 days after hatching. Both parents take part in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. The timing of the breeding season varies in different parts of the world. Nests may be parasitized by the pin-tailed whydah which lays its eggs in the nests of estrildid finches. In captivity they will breed in an aviary and can raise four broods in a year.\n\nThe diet consists mainly of grass seeds but insects are also eaten on occasions, especially during the breeding season when more protein is needed. The waxbills typically forage in flocks which may contain hundreds or even thousands of birds. They usually feed by clinging to the stems with their long, spindly claws and picking from the flower heads but they will also search for fallen seeds on the ground. They need to drink regularly as the seeds contain little water.\n\n\n", "id": "7700184", "categories": ["Birds described in 1758", "Estrilda", "Birds of the Gulf of Guinea", "Birds of Sub-Saharan Africa"], "title": "Common waxbill"}

The HGK consists of a team of experts and two B200 Beechcraft planes stationed at the Güvercinlik Army Air Base in Ankara. They have the capacity for global aerial coverage are open to any proposals from international bodies in need of their services.\n\nTurkish mapping dates to the 15th century. Some of the first examples of Turkish mapping include charts drawn by Ibrahim Mursel, and a world chart painted in nine colors on a deer skin by the famous navy commander of the Ottoman Empire, Admiral Piri Reis. A great number of maps can be found dating up to the 19th century which exemplify the historical aspect of Turkish mapping.\n\nThe establishment of the \"Mapping Commission\" in 1895, as a unit subordinate to the Fifth Department of the Turkish General Staff, is accepted as the beginning of modern cartography in Turkey. The Mapping Commission is considered the precursor to the current office, the General Command of Mapping. The Mapping Commission performed its preliminary works in five or six rooms reserved for them on the upper floor of the old Gendarmerie Office.\n\nSince the rapid production of the maps needed urgently for national defense required a larger and more capable organization, the Mapping Commission was arranged on October 28, 1918. The Commission was established as an independent mapping department of the Ministry of National Defense, which by that time had several branches: triangulation, topography, reconnaissance, cartography, central offices, a surveying battalion and a surveying school.\n\nThe Mapping Department moved to Ankara from Istanbul after the Turkish War of Independence. It was settled in the Attar Basi Khan in Koyunpazari, which at the time was almost in the center of the city. The printing section also started its work in the same building, which today is the School of Arts in Ulus. In 1924, the Department, which is still inside the General Directorate Garrison, moved to buildings located between the Military Sewing Plant and the General Directorate.\n\nFollowing this relocation, maps and plans required by governmental bodies, universities, and private companies were produced in line with the changes laid down after the foundation of the new state, the Turkish Republic. After these developments, a need arose for reorganization of the department. Lieut. Gen. M. Sevki (Ölçer), now regarded as the founder of the General Command of Mapping, prepared a bill for the new organization, the General Directorate of Mapping. He sent it to the Ministry of National Defense in early 1925.\n\nAccording to the legal procedure, following the approval of Ministry of National Defense, the bill was passed to the Prime Ministry to be discussed in the Ministerial Council and presented to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, the body with authority to pass the bill.\n\nAs a result, the Law No. 657 was enacted by the parliament on May 2, 1925. This law authorized the re-organization of the Mapping Department under a new name, the \"General Directorate of Mapping\" reporting to the Ministry of National Defense. The law made the National Mapping Agency responsible for the production of all kinds of maps and plans to meet the requirements of Turkish Armed Forces and all governmental bodies, specifically ministries, universities, private companies and individuals.\n\nAs a result of these changes, the General Directorate of Mapping had the following departments:\n\nLaw No. 657 was amended with Law No. 203 on January 2, 1961. Due to the policies created by the \"Inter-Ministerial Commission for Coordinating and Planning of Mapping Affairs\" and to the instructions set forth in the by-law for supply and usage of maps and mapping information, the General Directorate of Mapping was renamed in 1983 to the \"General Command of Mapping\". This change also entitled the HGK to produce maps at scales smaller than 1/5,000. The production of maps at a scale of 1/25,000, which is the base scale, is carried out according to the specifications of NATO standards STANAG, which ensure interoperability among NATO nations.\n\n", "id": "7700204", "categories": ["Geography of Turkey", "Government agencies established in 1895", "Organizations based in Ankara", "National mapping agencies", "Maps of Turkey", "Ministry of National Defence of Turkey", "Government agencies of Turkey"], "title": "General Command of Mapping (Turkey)"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700239", "text": "Simeon ben Zemah Duran\n\nSimeon ben Zemah Duran, also Tzemach Duran (1361–1444; ), known as Rashbatz () or Tashbatz was a Rabbinical authority, student of philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and especially of medicine, which he practised for a number of years at Palma (de Majorca). A major 15th century posek, his published decisions in matters of halacha have been widely quoted in halachic literature for hundreds of years.\n\nSimeon ben Tzemach was born in the Hebrew month of Adar, 1361. Various accounts put his birthplace as either Barcelona, or the island of Majorca. He was a near relation but not a grandson of Levi ben Gershon. He was a student of Ephraim Vidal, and of Jonah de Maestre, rabbi in Zaragoza or in Calatayud, whose daughter Bongoda he married. \n\nAfter the persecution of 1391 (in the Balearic Isles) and Majorca he fled Spain with his father and sister for Algiers, where, in addition to practicing medicine, he continued his studies during the earlier part of his stay. In 1394 he and the Algerian rabbi Isaac ben Sheshet (known as Rivash) drafted statutes for the Jewish community of Algiers. After Rivash's retirement, Duran became rabbi of Algiers in 1407. Unlike his predecessor, he refused on principle to accept any confirmation of his appointment by the regent. As Duran had lost all his property during the massacre at Palma, he was forced against his will to accept a salary from the community, not having other means of subsistence. He held this office until his death. His epitaph, written by himself, has been reprinted for the first time, from a manuscript, in \"Orient, Lit.\" v. 452. According to Joseph Sambari, Simon was much respected in court circles (\"Medieval Jew. Chron.\" i. 130). He was the father of the Rashbash.\n\nDuran's \"Magen Avot\" was a polemic against Christians and Muslims, of which the fourth chapter of the second part was published separately as \"Keshet u-Magen\" (The Arrow and the Shield).\n\nSimon was prolific. He wrote commentaries on several tractates of the Mishnah and the Talmud and on Alfasi (Nos. 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, and 16 in the list of his works given below); he treated various religious dogmas as well as the synagogal rite of Algiers (Nos. 5, 8, 10, 16), while in his responsa he showed a profound acquaintance with the entire halakic literature. His theologico-philosophical scholarship, as well as his secular learning, is conspicuous in his elaborate work, \"Magen Abot,\" in which he also appears as a clever controversialist (No. 7). The same ability is evidenced in his writings against Hasdai Crescas, which afford him an opportunity to defend Maimonides (No. 2), in his commentary on the Pentateuch (No. 6), where he takes occasion to enter into polemics with Levi ben Gershon, and in that on the Book of Job (No. 1), especially the introduction. In his commentary on the Pirke Avot he shows a broad historical sense (No. 7, part iv.) and it is not improbable that the tradition which ascribes to him the historico-didactic poem \"Seder ha-Mishneh leha-Rambam\" (No. 9) is well founded.\n\nSimon also wrote a considerable number of poems, both religious and secular (Nos. 9 [?], 15); commented on the Pesah Haggadah, the Hoshanot, the works of more ancient poets (Nos. 5 (c), 13, 14), and he was the author of numerous pamphlets. The following list of Duran's writings is arranged according to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, on the basis of a catalogue drawn up by the author himself (Responsa, vol. iii.):\n\n\n\n", "id": "7700239", "categories": ["Algerian Jews", "Exponents of Jewish law", "15th-century rabbis", "1444 deaths", "Medieval Majorcan Jews", "14th-century rabbis", "1361 births", "People from Palma, Majorca"], "title": "Simeon ben Zemah Duran"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700255", "text": "Dutch Colonial Revival architecture\n\nDutch Colonial is a style of domestic architecture, primarily characterized by gambrel roofs having curved eaves along the length of the house. Modern versions built in the early 20th century are more accurately referred to as \"Dutch Colonial Revival\", a subtype of the Colonial Revival style.\n\nThe modern use of the term is to indicate a broad gambrel roof with flaring eaves that extend over the long sides, resembling a barn in construction. The early houses built by settlers were often a single room, with additions added to either end (or short side) and very often a porch along both long sides. Typically, walls were made of stone and a chimney was located on one or both ends. Common were double-hung sash windows with outward swinging wood shutters and a central double Dutch door.\n\nSettlers of the Dutch colonies in New York, Delaware, New Jersey, and western Connecticut built these homes in ways familiar to the regions of Europe from which they came, like the Low Countries, the Palatine parts of Germany, and Huguenot regions of France. Used for its modern meaning of \"gambrel-roofed house\", the term does not reflect the fact that housing styles in Dutch-founded communities in New York evolved over time. In the Hudson Valley, for example, the use of brick, or brick and stone is perhaps more characteristic of Dutch Colonial houses than is their use of a gambrel roof. In Albany and Ulster Counties, frame houses were almost unknown before 1776, while in Dutchess and Westchester Counties, the presence of a greater proportion of settlers with English roots popularised more construction of wood-frame houses. After a period of log cabin and bank-dugout construction, the use of the inverted \"V\" roof shape was common. The gambrel roof was used later, predominantly between 1725 and 1775, although examples can be found from as early as 1705. The general rule before 1776 was to build houses that were only one-and-a-half stories high, except in Albany, where there were a greater proportion of two-story houses. Fine examples of these houses can be found today, like those in the Huguenot Street Historic District of New Paltz, New York.\n\nIn the American colonies both the Dutch and Germans plus others along the Rhine region of Europe contributed to the Dutch fashion. Three easily accessible examples of Dutch (Netherlands or German) architecture can be seen; 1.5 story 1676 Jan Martense Schenck House in the Brooklyn Museum, 1.5 story 1730s Schenck House located in the \"Old Beth Page\" Historic Village, and the two-story 1808 Gideon Tucker House at No. 2 White St at Broadway in Manhattan. All three represent distinctly Dutch (Netherlands-German) styles using \"H-frame\" for construction, wood clapboard, large rooms, double hung windows, off set front entry doors, sharply sloped roofs, and large \"open\" fireplaces. Often there is a Hipped roof, or curved eves, but not always. Barns in the Dutch-German fashion share the same attributes.\n\nExamples of hipped and not hipped roofs can be seen on the three examples provided above. The 1676 and 1730 Schenck houses are examples of Dutch houses with \"H-frame\" construction but without the \"hipped\" roof. The 1730 Schenck house has the distinctive \"curved eves\". Hips can be in a few different styles. The more common being a Mansard as known in Europe or \"gambrel\" as known in American English, both having two sloped on at least two sides. The Gideon Tucker (though an older Englishman) choose to build his house with a gambrel roof and in an urban Dutch-German fashion.\n\nBeginning in the late 19th century, America began to look back romantically upon its colonial roots and the country started reflecting this nostalgia in its architecture. Within this Colonial Revival, one of the more popular designs was a redux of features of the original Dutch Colonial. The term \"Dutch Colonial\" appeared sometime between 1920 and 1925.\n\nWithin the context of architectural history, the more modern style is specifically defined as \"Dutch Colonial Revival\" to distinguish it from the original Dutch Colonial. However, this style was popularly known simply as Dutch Colonial, and this continues to be the case today. In New York, for instance, the actual 17th-century colonial architecture of New Amsterdam has completely vanished (lost in the fires of 1776 and 1835), leaving only archaeological remnants.\n\nUp and through the 1930s, Dutch Colonials were most popular in the Northeast. While the original design was always reflected, some details were updated such as the primary entryway moving from the end to the long side of the house. The more modern versions also varied a great deal with regard to materials used, architectural details, and size. For example, one Dutch Colonial might be a small two-story structure of with dormers bearing shed-like overhangs, while another larger example would have three stories and a grand entrance adorned with a transom and sidelights.\n\nExamples of urban style of Dutch Colonial Revival architecture can be found in Manhattan, New York. 57 Stone Street was rebuilt in 1903 by C. P. H. Gilbert on behest of the owner Amos F. Eno. The buildings to the back on South William Street 13–23 also were reconstructed in the Dutch revival style, evoking New Amsterdam with the use of red brick as building material and the features of stepped gables. Stepped gables on early 20th-century Dutch Revival buildings on S William Street in Lower Manhattan recall the Dutch origins of the city. The area was declared a historic district in 1996 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.\n\nThe Children's Aid Society had a number of its centers constructed in the Dutch colonial revival style, such as the Rhinelander Children's Center at 350 East 88th Street, the 6th Street Industrial School on 630 East 6th Street, the Fourteenth Ward Industrial School at 256–258 Mott Street, and the Elizabeth Home for Girls at 307 East 12th Street.\n\nWest End Avenue saw a large number of buildings designed in the Dutch colonial revival style. The West End Collegiate Church was modelled after the Vleeshal at the Grote Markt in Haarlem.\n\nFurther examples in New York City are the former George S. Bowdoin Stable at 149 East 38th Street, 119 West 81st Street, and 18 West 37th Street.\n\nAn industrial example was the Wallabout Market, designed by the architect William Tubby and constructed in 1894–1896. They were demolished in 1941 during World War II.\n\nSunnyside in Tarrytown, New York, was partly constructed in Dutch Colonial revival.\n\n112 Ocean Avenue, a Dutch Colonial home, became infamous as the site of the \"Amityville Horror\".\n\n", "id": "7700255", "categories": ["Dutch Colonial Revival architecture", "American architectural styles", "20th-century architecture", "Revival architectural styles", "Dutch Colonial Revival architecture in the United States", "Dutch architectural styles"], "title": "Dutch Colonial Revival architecture"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700288", "text": "Goodenough College\n\nGoodenough College is a postgraduate residence and educational trust on Mecklenburgh Square in Bloomsbury, central London, England. Other names under which the college has been known are London House, William Goodenough House, and the London Goodenough Trust.\n\nGoodenough College is an educational charity that provides residential accommodation for talented British and international postgraduates and their families studying in London. The College provides a vibrant community for all those who live here through a unique programme of intellectual, cultural and social activities that aims to provide Members with an international network and a truly global outlook.\n\nThe current director of the college is Rebecca Matthews MA (Cantab), Former Managing Director of the European Capital of Culture Aarhus 2017. \n\nGoodenough has residential and study facilities and an extensive extra-curricular programme, which includes a conference series aimed at examining subjects of international concern. As of 2018 the College is home to approximately 700 International postgraduate students and their families, representing approximately 80 different nations. \n\nThe college is located in London and set on Mecklenburgh Square, around a private garden to which only residents have access.\n\nThe college was incorporated in 1930, by a group of prominent Londoners, including the chairman of Barclays Bank and founder of Barclays Bank DCO (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Frederick Craufurd Goodenough. Goodenough and his friends wanted to provide able young men coming to London from the dominions and colonies, future leaders of what was then a large empire, with a collegiate life along Oxbridge lines in London. The college was a moot hall and at the same time a place where they would form lasting friendships in tolerance and understanding.\n\nThe search for a site for the new college was centred on Bloomsbury, to which the University of London was preparing a move from South Kensington. An ideal island site for sale freehold was found between Guilford Street and Mecklenburgh Square, and the College bought it in 1930.\n\nPlans were to design and build a new college, but this would take time which the governors did not want to waste. In the traditional manner of Bloomsbury's philanthropic institutions, they made a start in a small way in some of the roomy old houses on the site. London House first opened its doors in October 1931, in Nos. 4–7 Caroline Place (now Mecklenburgh Place) on the west side of the site. The house was soon full, with a long waiting list, and by the start of World War II occupied all the Caroline Place houses.\n\nA new London House for 300 single students was built between 1935 and 1963 to the designs of the architect Sir Herbert Baker, his partner Alexander T. Scott, and their successor Vernon Helbing. It was completed in three stages:\n\nStage 1 (1935–37). The south-east corner including the Great Hall, Charles Parsons Library, common-rooms and the Guilford Street entrance. This was the only part to be completed in Sir Herbert Baker’s lifetime.\n\nStage 2 (1948–53). The rest of the south wing, the west wing and the north-west corner. Alexander Scott continued in Baker’s style, with some simplification of detail.\n\nStage 3 (1961–63). The north wing, including the north-east corner. It was built to a lower cost than the other stages, for example, no flint-work. At the same time, architect Vernon Helbing created the college chapel out of former offices.\n\nIn the 1940s, at the instigation of the Chairman of the College Governors, Sir William Goodenough, the Lord Mayor of London launched a Thanksgiving Fund, to raise money in the U.K. and do something to thank the people of the Commonwealth and the United States for their generous gifts, especially of food parcels, during and after World War II. The money raised was used to build William Goodenough House for women and married students from those countries, replacing houses destroyed or badly damaged in the war on the north east of the Square. At the same time the bombed houses in adjacent Heathcote Street were rebuilt as an annexe, and the House was completed in 1957. Later wings, Julian Crossley Court (1974) and Ashley Ponsonby Court (1991) brought the capacity of the House up to 120 rooms for single students and 60 flats for married couples and families.\n\nThe two parallel institutions developed their own characters over time – the quiet surroundings of the WGH common rooms appealed to some LH residents, and various \"Willie G\" girls preferred the noisier atmosphere of the London House bar. Traditions developed, such as the LH rugby team singing lullabies to the inhabitants of WGH after the annual sports dinner, and many LH-WGH romances flourished, and in some cases resulted in marriage and even children. The two houses, London House and William Goodenough House eventually became mixed in 1991.\n\nNos. 22–25 Mecklenburgh Square survived the war and were used as a nurses’ home until 1989 when they were handed back in a very dilapidated state. At first, the houses were repaired and used as inexpensive accommodation for short-stay visitors, mostly returning alumni and other academics in London to attend conferences and seminars. By 1997, however, it was apparent that the building required modernization if they were to meet the standards that would be required in the 21st century.\n\nThe houses were closed, and plans made to add No. 21 and renovate and upgrade at a cost of £3.5 million. There were delays because the Georgian houses are listed buildings in a conservation area, and the work required the approval of both English Heritage and the London Borough of Camden planning department. Eventually, the plans were passed, and the Goodenough Club opened its doors in April 2001. The hotel is open to academic and professional visitors as well as conference delegates from around the world, and was renamed as The Goodenough on Mecklenburgh Square in 2018.\n\nAs the name of the college and of the Director's equivalent position has changed over time, the title of each appointee is given.\n\nUp until the 1970s, London House was a single-sex men-only building. The position of London House warden was abolished in 2008.\n\nFrom the instigation of William Goodenough House in 1950, it was run by a separate warden. Up until the 1970s, William Goodenough House was a single-sex women-only building, while London House was a men-only building. The position of William Goodenough House warden was abolished in 2007.\n\n1940s\n\n1950s\n\n1960s\n\n1970s\n\n1980s\n\n1990s\n\n2000s\n\n\n", "id": "7700288", "categories": ["Education in the London Borough of Camden", "Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Camden", "Higher education colleges in London", "Buildings and structures in Bloomsbury", "Herbert Baker buildings and structures", "Educational institutions established in 1930", "Educational charities based in the United Kingdom"], "title": "Goodenough College"}

It was conquered by France in 1901.\n\nUnder the Songhai empire, Dendi had been the eastern-most province, governed by the prestigious \"Dendi-fari\" (\"governor of the eastern front\"). Askia Ishaq II fled to here after he was defeated by the invading Saadi dynasty of Morocco at the Battle of Tondibi and at another battle seven months later. In Dendi, he was deposed by his brother Muhammad Gao, who was in turn murdered on the order of the Moroccan pasha. The Moroccans then appointed Sulayman as puppet king ruling the Niger between Djenné and Gao. South of Tillaberi the Songhai resistance against Morocco continued under Askia Nuh, a son of Askia Dawud. He established his capital at the yet unlocalized town of Lulami.\n\nAfter the Moroccans had Askia Sulayman appointed as their puppet the pasha, Mahmud ibn Zarqun, attempted to conquer Dendi. Askia Nuh resisted the invasion by a costly guerilla warfare lasting two years. In 1594 Mahmud was forced to discontinue the war and retreated, just to be killed in the same year by Dogon, with whom Nuh was probably allied. The new pasha called Mansur continued the war against Dendi and again Nuh resorted to guerilla warfare. This situation lasted until 1599, when Nuh's followers became tired of the war and deposed him in favor of his brother Harun.\nIn 1609, the Malian city of Djenné revolted against the Saadi pashas (governors) with Dendi support. The Saadi were eventually able to regain the city, but with a lack of support from their homeland, they soon abandoned the area, leaving it to Tuareg and Fulbe nomads.\n\nIn 1612, Askiya al-Amin came to power in Dendi. His short reign of six years was followed by the rule of Askiya Dawud. Dawud killed many people during his reign including relatives and members of the military. His brother, Isma'il, fled to Timbuktu and sought Saadi support to overthrow al-Amin. Isma'il returned in to Dendi and deposed his brother in 1639. Upon attempting to send the foreign army back, he was deposed and replaced by a ruler that the pashas felt would be easier to deal with. This ruler was eventually removed by the Songhai people.\n\nDendi existed for the next two and a half centuries witnessing increasingly unstable reigns, coups and counter-coups. When France entered the region, Dendi was defensively unprepared. In 1901, the French deposed the last askiya of the Dendi, ending Songhai's control of either Mali or Niger until independence.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7700301", "categories": ["States and territories established in 1591", "Countries in precolonial Africa", "History of Niger", "States and territories disestablished in 1901", "Songhai Empire"], "title": "Dendi Kingdom"}

Since 1941, has partnered with local units of government to provide retirement, disability and death benefits for public employees. With a funded status of about 93 percent and nearly $40 billion in assets, IMRF is well-funded and sustainable.\n\nToday, IMRF has more than 410,000 members and serves about 3,000 different units of government, including towns and villages, libraries and park districts, and counties and school districts (non-teaching personnel). The average member who retired in 2016 is receiving a monthly pension of $1,791.\n\nIn 2017, IMRF received an Illinois Performance Excellence (ILPEx)] Gold Award for Achievement of Excellence. IMRF is governed by an elected board of trustees. IMRF is administered by a staff of 200 professionals, led by Executive Director Brian Collins.\n\nTo efficiently and impartially develop, implement, and administer in a prudent manner programs that provide income protection to members and their beneficiaries on behalf of participating employers.\n\nIMRF is established under statutes adopted by the Illinois General Assembly. It is governed by a fully elected board of eight trustees. Four trustees are elected by employers, three are elected by participating members, and one annuitant trustee is elected by IMRF retirees. The Board appoints an Executive Director who is responsible for all administrative functions and supervision of staff employees.\n\nIMRF is a defined benefit retirement plan that provides retirement, survivor, disability, and death benefits to municipal government employees in Illinois. It is governed by Article 7 of the Illinois Pension Code.\nEligible employees are automatically enrolled in IMRF when employment begins.\n\nAbout 98% of IMRF's membership participates in the Regular Plan. IMRF administers a separate plan for Sheriffs' Law Enforcement Personnel (SLEP).\n\nMembers participate as either Tier 1 or Tier 2 members. To participate as a Tier 1 member, the employee must have started work with an IMRF employer on or before December 31, 2010. All other members participate in Tier 2. All IMRF Tier 2 plans have a less generous benefit structure as compared to Tier 1. The cost to provide a Tier 2 pension is more than 40% less than the cost of providing a Tier 1 pension. IMRF expects half of its membership to participate in Tier 2 by 2019.\n\nThe 61st General Assembly of the State of Illinois created IMRF, effective July 29, 1939. The first meeting of the IMRF board was held on September 8, 1939, in the office of the Municipal Public Utility annuity and benefit fund at 135 S.

He sang as a chorister as a child in Salzburg; the \"New Grove\" asserts that he was probably the pupil of Leopold Mozart. He attended the University of Salzburg, studying logic and physics. His career as a bass began in 1785 with the theatrical company of Ludwig Schmidt.\n\nHe evidently had an impressively low vocal range; Branscombe (1991) observes that the very low notes that Mozart included in the part of Sarastro have been \"the despair of many a bass singer since.\"\n\nBy 1787 he had joined the theatrical company of Emanuel Schikaneder, for which he sang the demanding role of Osmin in Mozart's opera \"The Abduction from the Seraglio\" and other roles. In 1789 the troupe settled at the Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna. Gerl participated in a system of joint composition used by Schikaneder's troupe, in which \"Singspiele\" were produced rapidly by having several composers collaborate. As such, Gerl may have been the composer of the aria \"Ein Weib ist das herrlichste Ding\", for which Mozart wrote a set of variations for piano, K. 613 (the composer may instead have been another singer-composer in the troupe, Benedikt Schack).\n\nMozart gradually came to participate more in the activities of the Schikaneder troupe, culminating in his opera \"The Magic Flute\" (1791), with libretto by Schikaneder. Gerl premiered the role of Sarastro, and continued to sing this part in many performances through 1792. He left Schikaneder's troupe in 1793.\n\nGerl may have been a participant in a rehearsal of Mozart's \"Requiem\" on the day before the composer died; for details see Benedikt Schack.\n\nGerl's later career took him to Brno and Mannheim, where he retired in 1826. He died there on .\n\nPeter Branscombe, writing in the \"New Grove\", offers the following concerning Gerl's reputation as a singer: \"When Schröder, the greatest actor-manager of his age, went to Vienna in 1791 he was told not to miss hearing [Benedikt] Schack and Gerl at Schikaneder's theatre.\" Branscombe also notes the striking quality of the music that Mozart wrote for Gerl.\n\nGerl married the soprano Barbara Reisinger (1770–1806) on 2 September 1789. She also sang in the Schikaneder troupe, and performed the role of Papagena at the \"Magic Flute\" premiere.

Nephi's ministry was centered on Christ, and included prophesying of His birth, working miracles in His name, witnessing His visitation to the Americas after the Resurrection, and administering His church after He had ascended. Nephi was also the appointed recordkeeper for the Nephites during this period, and much of the text of Third Nephi is abridged from his account.\n\nNephi is first mentioned in the Book of Mormon when he inherits the Nephite records and sacred artifacts from his father, Nephi, son of Helaman, in the year 1 B.C. He lived (and was likely raised) in the Nephite capital city, Zarahemla, where his father lived and subsequently departed from, leaving Nephi with the full responsibilities of scribe. Neither Nephi's childhood nor age are referenced in the abridgement, although he had at least one younger sibling, Timothy. It is believed that he was born in 30 BC.\n\nIn the ninety-second year of the Reign of the Judges (1 BC), a \"great uproar\" broke out amongst the population over the yet-unfulfilled (and according to the \"unbelievers\", past-due) prophecy of Samuel the Lamanite, that Christ's birth would be signified by a new star and a night without darkness. Those who continued to look forward to the sign of Christ were scheduled for a mass execution.\n\nNephi, deeply disturbed by the wickedness of the people, \"prayed mightily\" to God for the condemned believers, even all day. Finally, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying:\n\"Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.\" \n\nAs promised, when the sun set that evening, the sky remained as bright as midday, fulfilling the anticipated prophecies and effectively preventing the impending genocide. A majority of the population was converted by this event, and Nephi went about \"baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great remission of sins\", which temporarily restored peace to the land.\n\nDespite the mass change of heart, and the continued preaching of Nephi and \"many others\" however, by 96 ROJ (AD 3), the people had already returned to wickedness and discrediting the miracles they had seen. For the next twenty-seven years, they would continue to fluctuate between extremes of piousness and rebellion, until finally abandoning their faith altogether. The government of over 120 years was intentionally corrupted and assassinated into extinction, and the society unraveled into tribes.\n\nNephi, having witnessed this downfall, renewed his efforts and began to preach with such boldness and power that the people \"were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words\".\n\nAdditionally, Nephi performed miracles in the name of Christ, including casting out devils, healing the sick, and raising his brother from the dead. He continued to preach and baptize throughout AD 33, converting \"many\".\n\nIn the advent of the next year, the signs of Christ's death, three hours of unparalleled destruction followed by three days of darkness (also prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite) were given.\n\n", "id": "7700376", "categories": [], "title": "Nephi the Disciple"}

It was once believed the area had very little food for the animals (researchers described it as the shark equivalent of a desert), but research in early 2018 by the vessel \"Falkor\" showed that there is a rich and diverse food chain too deep to be detected by satellites that provides a potentially abundant food supply for the sharks.

Ikastolak can be nowadays either private or public, divided into different networks.\n\nThe Basque language public network relies on state funding and management, allocated in Spain by the education institutions of the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre in their corresponding territories, while in France the association Ikas-Bi in the public network advocates for bilingual education. Seaska is the private network of Basque language schools in the French Basque Country, closely linked to the similar network in the Southern Basque Country. The private networks base their activity on the fees paid by parents, popular subscription (either directly or by means of annual massive festivals, e.g. \"Herri Urrats, Nafarroa Oinez, Araba Euskaraz\", etc.) and the allowance provided by public educational institutions.\n\nAlthough spoken more widely than in later times, there was very little schooling undertaken in Basque before the early 20th century revival in Basque nationalism. Spanish and French were mandatory in schooling at either side of the border. The first official ikastola was opened in 1914, and the movement to transfer the medium of education in the Southern Basque Country from Spanish to Basque became widespread in the late 20th century. \n\nDuring the early 1930s, the seeds of the \"Basque Schools\" (\"Escuelas Vascas\") were sown in Navarre by the Basque Nationalist Party, featuring an instruction where the teachings of the Christian doctrine were central. They were conceived as an attempt to counter increased laicization of state schools and the lack of focus (\"the neutrality\") on Basque matters in regular religious schooling. The first such educative institution was founded in November 1931 at Pamplona, followed by another one in Estella-Lizarra (1933) and Elizondo (1935). \n\nFollowing the Republican defeat in the Spanish Civil War, the public use of Basque was made illegal, and all educational institutions were forced to teach entirely through the medium of Castilian, to the complete neglect and persecution of Basque. There are, however, isolated examples of ikastolak which clandestinely continued to teach in Basque. \n\nSince thousands of children were studying out of the authorized schools and hence forbidden to progress to higher education, in 1969 the Roman Catholic Church arranged with the parent associations the lawful Diocesan Federation of Ikastolas, later becoming a secular federation. With the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975, large degrees of self-government were given to the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre, and ikastolak sprang up all over the Basque region in northern Spain.\n\nFor a time, the ikastolak operated along the public school system, the private schools publicly funded under a charter and the private schools. During his term as Basque minister for education, the Socialist Fernando Buesa proposed the 1993 Law of the Basque Public School, prompting ikastolak to choose between full integration in the public system or operating under the rules for chartered private schools.\n\nAt the present time, tens of thousands of schoolchildren in the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre attend ikastolak, but the status of ikastolak differs greatly depending on their location. They are firmly entrenched in the traditionally Basque-speaking areas of the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC), but less so in non-Basque speaking areas (i.e. the southern fringes). Basque language schools in the north of Navarre do not enjoy the same support from the regional government as they do in the BAC, but they are officially recognised and enjoy widespread local support (traditionally Basque speaking), unlike central and southern areas of Navarre, where they lack public recognition and funding, remaining in a legal limbo until 2007.\n\nIn the French Basque Country, the ikastolak developed later, but grew steadily, so much so that a network, Seaska, is now widespread throughout the whole territory covering education up to the A levels.\n\n\nOfficial site of the Federation of Ikastolak (Basque)\n", "id": "7700417", "categories": ["Basque culture", "Minority schools", "Education in Spain", "Education in France"], "title": "Ikastola"}

It is traditionally indicated by hanging a broom from a mast or lashing it to the periscope of a submarine.\n\nIt is said the use of brooms in this respect originated during the 1650s, when the Dutch Admiral Maarten Tromp, after a decisive victory in the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Battle of Dungeness of 1652, hung a broom from his mast to indicate he had \"swept the British from the seas\" - his opponent Admiral Blake is said to have responded with the hoisting of a whip, indicating he would whip the Dutch into submission. However, both stories are legends; a broom in the seventeenth century indicated the ship was for sale.\n\nThe United States Submarine Service during World War II generally considered a patrol a \"clean sweep\" if the sub sank every target she engaged. Individual torpedoes might miss, and convoys usually had far too many ships for all to be sunk by a single boat, but these unavoidable inefficiencies did not mar a \"clean sweep.\"\n\nFew wide-ranging war patrols have been conducted since World War II, so commanding officers have taken other opportunities to fly brooms. For example, in the year 2000 the Military Sealift Command hung a broom from the flagpole yardarm outside their headquarters to symbolize its \"clean sweep\" of the Y2K bug on all the command's ships.\n\nIn 2003, under circumstances perhaps closer to the traditional context, after USS \"Cheyenne\" launched her Tomahawk missiles during Operation Iraqi Freedom, her commanding officer decided that placing all missiles on target, with no duds or failures, was a modern \"clean sweep.\"\n\nFor decades, brooms have been flown by warships that successfully pass all elements of their sea trials.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700494", "text": "Rhizopogon\n\nRhizopogon is a genus of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes in the family Rhizopogonaceae. Species form hypogeous sporocarps commonly referred to as \"false truffles\". The general morphological characters of \"Rhizopogon\" sporocarps are a simplex or duplex peridium surrounding a loculate gleba that lacks a columnella. Basidiospores are produced upon basidia that are borne within the fungal hymenium that coats the interior surface of gleba locules. The peridium is often adorned with thick mycelial cords, also known as rhizomorphs, that attach the sporocarp to the surrounding substrate. The scientific name \"Rhizopogon\" is Greek for 'root' (Rhiz-) 'beard' (-pogon) and this name was given in reference to the rhizomorphs found on sporocarps of many species.\n\n\"Rhizopogon\" species are primarily found in ectomycorrhizal association with trees in the family Pinaceae and are especially common symbionts of pine, fir, and Douglas fir trees. Through their ectomycorrhizal relationships \"Rhizopogon\" are thought to play an important role in the ecology of coniferous forests. Recent micromorphological and molecular phylogenetic study has established that \"Rhizopogon\" is a member of the Boletales, closely related to \"Suillus\".\n\nThe genus \"Rhizopogon\" occurs throughout the natural and introduced ranges of family Pinaceae trees. Though this range covers much of the northern temperate zones, the diversity of \"Rhizopogon\" species is well characterized only in North America and Europe. There are currently over 150 recognized species of \"Rhizopogon\". The morphology of \"Rhizopogon\" species is highly cryptic and characters vary greatly throughout sporocarp maturity. This has led to the description of multiple species from various developmental stages of a single fungus.\n\nThe genus \"Rhizopogon\" was first described from Europe by Elias Magnus Fries in 1817. The North American monograph was produced by Alexander H. Smith in 1966 with second author credits given posthumously to Sanford Myron Zeller due to his contributions to the study of the genus. A European monograph of \"Rhizopogon\" has also been published. In the recent past, molecular phylogenetic methods have allowed the revision of the taxonomic concepts of the genus \"Rhizopogon\"\n\nModern taxonomic concepts of the genus \"Rhizopogon\" recognize five subgenera of \"Rhizopogon\". These are subgenus \"Rhizopogon\", subgenus \"Versicolores\", subgenus \"Villosuli\", subgenus \"Amylopogon\", and subgenus \"Roseoli\".\n\n\"Rhizopogon\" species have been established as a common component in the diet of many small mammals as well as deer in Western North America. The viability of \"Rhizopogon\" spores is maintained and may even be increased after mammalian gut passage, making mammals an important dispersal vector for \"Rhizopogon\".\n\n\"Rhizopogon\" species are common members of the fungal communities that colonize the roots of trees during seedling establishment and persist into old growth stands. \"Rhizopogon\" spores are long lived in soil and the spores of some species can persist for at least four years with an increase in viability over time. \"Rhizopogon\" seems to be especially common upon the roots of establishing tree seedlings following disturbance such as fire or logging. \"Rhizopogon\" are also abundant colonizers of pot cultivated and field cultivated conifer seedlings growing in soil from conifer stands that lacked observations of \"Rhizopogon\" upon the roots of mature trees. These finding suggest that \"Rhizopogon\" species are an important factor in the recovery of conifer forests following disturbance.\n\nThe first intentional use of \"Rhizopogon\" species in forestry occurred in the early part of the 20th century when \"Rhizopogon luteolus\" was deliberately introduced into \"Pinus radiata\" plantations in Western Australia after it was observed to improve tree growth. Since that time, \"Rhizopogon\" species have been widely studied as a component of managed forests. \"Rhizopogon\" species have been noted as common members of the ectomycorrhizal community colonizing tree roots of pine and Douglas-fir timber plantations. Naturally occurring \"Rhizopogon roseolus\" (\"=rubescens\") spores have been shown to out-compete the spores of other ectomycorrhizal fungi in pine plantations even when competing spores were directly inoculated onto seedlings. The survival rate and performance of pine and Douglas-fir plantation seedlings are increased after inoculation with \"Rhizopogon\" species.\n\nThough many species of \"Rhizopogon\" are considered edible, most are not held in high culinary esteem. A notable exception is \"Rhizopogon roseolus\" (\"=rubescens\") which is considered a delicacy in east Asia and especially in Japan where it is traditionally known as Shoro. Techniques for the commercial cultivation of this fungus in pine plantations have been developed and applied with successful results in Japan and New Zealand.\n\n", "id": "7700494", "categories": ["Rhizopogonaceae"], "title": "Rhizopogon"}

In the High Court Fingal County Council sought an injunction and the imprisonment of Joe Higgins and Clare Daly of the Socialist Party, and Irish Socialist Network members John O'Neill and Colm Breathnach. These imprisonments escalated the campaign and for a number of weeks refuse collection in the Dublin area was severely disrupted due to protests.

With the separation of Pakistan in 1949, the NWFP team was admitted into the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, and again played at Peshawar until they were replaced in the Trophy by a Peshawar city team in 1956. Before that, Pakistan had entertained India for the only Test match to be played here. In a drawn four-day encounter, Polly Umrigar hit a century for India before he was run out.\n\nThe following year, New Zealand played a Governor-General of Pakistan's XI here, while a full-strength Pakistan side beat a non-Test touring team from Marylebone Cricket Club. For Quaid-e-Azam Trophy matches, the Peshawar team switched between this ground and the Peshawar Gymkhana Ground until 1971.

The work won the Vayalar Award, given for the best literary work in Malayalam, in 1985. It also won the Muttathu Varkey Award in 1994. The novel has been translated to multiple languages. It was translated into English as \"Second Turn\" in 1997. Another English translation by Gita Krishnankutty published in 2013 is titled \"Bhima: Lone Warrior\".\n\nThe novel is a retelling of the Indian epic \"Mahabharata\" from the perspective of Bhima, the second Pandava. The story deviates from the traditional \"Mahabharata\" story as it avoids the divine elements of the ancient epic and re-represent the characters and events realistically. One of the reasons critics cite for the novel's cult following is its revisionism, that was a first time in Malayalam literature. The book was translated to Tamil by Kurunjivelan as \"Irandaam Idam\" with cover illustration by Trotsky Marudu. \n\nA film adaptation starring Mohanlal is scheduled for 2020; it is set to become India's most expensive film production at US$ 155 million and the most expensive non-English-language film.\n\nThe story begins with the incident of Mahaprasthanika Parva where the Pandavas leave for the pilgrimage to Himalayas forsaking all the worldly possessions. The story runs through the eyes of Bhima who faces seemingly severe frustrations as a young man. Always destined to be second to his weak elder brother Yudhishthira in seniority and younger brother Arjuna in fame and popularity, Bhima is not given his due as the main architect of the Pandava victory over their cousins Kauravas in the Kurukshetra war, despite killing all the 100 Kauravas. The book unravels all the hardship and dilemmas encountered by Bhima which remain unnoticed. The book explores the emotions of the mighty Pandava as a son, brother, husband and father. The book brings to light the affection that he holds for his wife draupadi and how unnoticed his acts of love remains. The story questions the mourning of Arjuna's son, Abhimanyu when he is killed during the battle while trying to break the Chakravyuh formation, while Bhima's son, Ghatokkach is led to his death by sacrificing his life to save Arjuna's life and his sacrifice too remains unsung and everyone enjoys the happiness of saving Arjuna's life. Towards the end of the book he is shown as the only husband who seems to stop trying to be with darupadi at her last moment during their pilgrimage.\n\nIn 2011, director Hariharan announced his plan to adapt \"Randamoozham\" to screen, scripted by M. T. Vasudevan Nair himself with Mohanlal cast to play Bhima. Later, V. A. Shrikumar Menon took the project again with Mohanlal in the lead, it was announced in April 2017 that the film adaptation will be produced by B. R. Shetty. With its 1000 crore (10 billion) budget, the film is expected to be the most expensive film in Indian cinema, and the most expensive non-English language film. The film will be shot in two parts. The first part is planned to be released in 2020.\n\n", "id": "7700577", "categories": ["1984 novels", "Indian novels adapted into films", "Novels set in India", "Novels by M. T.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700578", "text": "Xestia\n\nXestia is a genus of noctuid moths (family Noctuidae). They are the type genus of the tribe Xestiini in subfamily Noctuinae, though some authors merge this tribe with the Noctuini. Species in this genus are commonly known as \"clays\", \"darts\" or \"rustics\", but such names are commonplace among Noctuidae. \"Xestia\" moths have a wide distribution, though they most prominently occur in the Holarctic.\n\nWith almost 200 species included at one time, \"Xestia\" was something of a \"wastebin genus\". But almost half of the traditional species are now placed elsewhere (see below), and some of the remaining ones are liable to be assigned to another genus also. On the other hand, new moths that probably do belong in this genus are still being discovered (e.g. \"X. hypographa\", which led to the 2002 transfer of \"X. ornata\" from \"Eugraphe\" to here). Thus, unless there are drastic taxonomic changes in the future, \"Xestia\" is likely to remain one of the larger noctuine genera.\n\n\"Xestia\" adults are usually of medium size and robust build, with stout hairy bodies and strong wings. Some are quite colorful, with bold lighter markings and hindwings in delicate yellowish, reddish or bluish hues. Generally, they are cryptic while at rest however, with unmarked pale or dull brownish hindwings; they do not have metallic hues and few species possess obvious eyespots.\nThis genus includes many species living at high latitudes and altitudes, in tundra and taiga ecosystems. Some have two-year (semivoltine) life cycles and only occur as adults every other year; typically the caterpillar larva overwinters to pupate in spring, with the moths flying around midsummer, but some species eclose later, their moths flying from late summer into autumn. \"Xestia\" caterpillars are generally stout and cryptically colored; in some species they have quite prominent dark lengthwise spots, but may e.g. be entirely green or whatever else gives best camouflage.\n\nSome species' larvae are notoriously polyphagous, e.g. the setaceous Hebrew character (\"X. c-nigrum\"), the food of which includes all sorts of core eudicots – including solanaceae and others which are poisonous to many herbivores – as well as some monocots. The latter are mainly Poaceae however, and few other monocots are utilized by \"Xestia\" larvae in general. Ericaceae, as well as Betulaceae and Poaceae, are key food plants for many of the high-latitude species. Gymnosperms are food plants of secondary importance in this genus, but Pinaceae form the mainstay or exclusive food of some species which occasionally become more than nuisance pests. Altogether, \"Xestia\" moths are only known as major pests within limited areas or in regard to specific plants, in which cases damage can be economically significant though.\n\nEven though the larval food plants of many \"Xestia\" species are not or insufficiently known, those on record are from all major lineages of core eudicots. Among the basal core eudicots, Caryophyllales (especially Polygonaceae) are particularly significant, of the asterids the Asterales (especially Asteraceae), Ericales (especially Ericaceae) and Lamiales (especially Plantaginaceae), and of the rosids the Malpighiales (numerous families) and Rosales (especially Rosaceae). Less important asterid orders among \"Xestia\" food plants are for example Dipsacales, Gentianales and Solanales, of the rosids e.g. Fabales, Fagales, Malvales, Myrtales and Sapindales. More basal (mes)angiosperms do not seem to be significant as \"Xestia\" food plants, at least not in temperate and cooler regions.\n\nAs far as is known, \"Xestia\" adults are nocturnal or crepuscular (except of course the high-latitude species), but are often attracted to lights at night. They general feed on flowers with relatively short or no corolla, and will also drink other sugary liquids.\n\nSeveral species formerly placed here are now in \"Agnorisma\" and \"Pseudohermonassa\"; whether other genera are accepted varies among authors; \"Estimata\", \"Hemigraphiphora\" and \"Perinaenia\" are provisionally considered distinct here. \"\"Xestia\"\" \"versuta\" does not seem to belong in the present genus; it may be an aberrant member of \"Goniographa\", but until this is resolved it is here treated under its original name \"Eugraphe versuta\".\n\nFurthermore, a case for separation has in particular been made for \"Amathes\" (possibly including \"Agrotiphila\"), \"Lytaea\", \"Megasema\" (possibly including \"Megarhomba\"), \"Segetia\" and \"Schoyenia\" (with \"Archanarta\" occasionally also separate), but these are here included in \"Xestia\". Some of them are, however, recognized as subgenera, and if the genus is split further would be first to become elevated in rank again. There is no real good justification for either treatment, except that the lengthy process of a thorough revision of noctuine systematics and taxonomy has only progressed so far. H. Beck in 1996 published a comprehensive taxonomic catalogue, introducing generic names for most European groups of (presumably) related species. While few of these seem to stand any chance ever to be widely recognized as distinct genera, this step is likely to have made available a generic name for any taxa that are eventually split from \"Xestia sensu stricto\".\n\nJunior synonyms and other obsolete generic names for \"Xestia\" moths are:\nThe 110 or so species here placed in \"Xestia\" are divided among five subgenera. Two of these are further divided into groups, which are based on phenetic similarity however and may or may not form clades and/or species complexes. Some of these would presumably warrant recognition as subgenera if the present-day subgenera are split off; the subgeneric names that would apply are given (if known) in the addition to the species-group names.\n\nAbout one-third of the species here included in \"Xestia\" are \"incertae sedis\" (of unclear assignment). Among this group are a few species which are extremely little known, having been described long ago but studied only once or twice since then.\n\nIf the affiliations of the subgenera are not very much mistaken, most remaining cases of erroneous assignment to \"Xestia\" are to be found among the species of uncertain group affiliation here; for the recently described \"X. kecskerago\" for example it was explicitly stated that placement in the present genus is tentative. Other species of unclear affiliation are so little known that even their validity remains questionable, though this group equally well seems to contain quite distinct lineages of true \"Xestia\". Also, there are some obvious species groups which do not easily fit into the subgeneric scheme above.\n\n", "id": "7700578", "categories": ["Xestia"], "title": "Xestia"}

The relationships between the four true auklets remains unclear. Auklets are threatened by invasive species such as Arctic foxes (\"Alopex lagopus\") and Norway rats (\"Rattus norvegicus\") because of their high degree of coloniality and crevice-nesting.\n\nThe genus \"Aethia\" occurs only in the North Pacific and adjacent waters, mainly in the Bering Sea region. Along with Cassin's auklet (\"Ptychoramphus aleuticus\") they comprise the monophyletic tribe Aethinii. Molecular work has not yet resolved the relationship between the \"Aethia\" auklets, but the group is a sister group to Cassin's auklet, which is, in turn, a sister group to the Fraterculine auks (puffins and rhinoceros auklet).\n\nThe genus \"Aethia\" did not enter into widespread use until the 1960s. Initially, the auklets were placed in \"Alca\", but later reorganized into genera including: \"Simorhynchus\", \"Phaleris\" and \"Cyclorhynchus\". \"Cyclorhynchus\" is still occasionally used for the parakeet auklet.\n\nThe first undisputed auk fossils are from the middle Miocene (15 million years ago). The first \"Aethia\" fossils date from the late Miocene (8–13 million years ago) and the four extant species likely diverged rapidly about 5 million years ago.\n\nThere are one or two fossil species which lived in the area of today's California during the Late Miocene, some 5 million years ago: \"Aethia rossmoori\" Howard, 1968 (Monterrey Formation of Orange County),and an undescribed taxon tentatively placed in this genus.\nFrom the Pliocene there are \"Aethia barnesi\" N. A. Smith, 2013 (San Mateo Formation of San Diego County, California, and \"Aethia storeri\" N. A. Smith, 2013 (San Mateo Formation of San Diego County, California.\n\nThere are four species of \"Aethia\".\nCensusing breeding auklets can be difficult because they nest in hidden crevices. At present, population estimates are:\n\n\"Aethia\" auklets are endemic to the North Pacific Ocean and Sea of Okhotsk with notable Asian colonies in the Kuril Islands, Commander Islands, along the Kamchatka and Chukota Peninsulas. In North America, large colonies are in the Aleutian Islands (Buldir, Kiska, Semisopochnoi and Gareloi) to the Gulf of Alaska and north to the islands of the Bering Sea (St. Lawrence Island, Pribilof Islands, St. Matthew Island).\n\nAuklets have high site fidelity, at both the colony and crevice level, although there can be a high divorce rate of up to 33% in least and crested auklets when both mates survive.\n\nWinter distribution of auklets is poorly known. Whiskered auklets likely winter near to breeding colonies and many were reported by Aleuts to winter in the general area. Auklets from the northern Bering Sea must move further south because of pack ice surrounding colonies during the winter.\n\nAuklets are typically very social and nest in dense colonies (Parakeet auklets are more dispersed). All have some form of facial ornamentation such as large crests (Whiskered and crested auklets), auricular plumes (all four species), and crested and whiskered auklets have a tangerine-scented odour which may function in mate choice or species recognition, although this requires more study.\n\nAll \"Aethia\" auklets lay one white egg in a natural crevice and incubate for 25–36 days, after which, a semi-precocial chick emerges and fledges after 25–35 days. Age at first breeding is estimated at 3–5 years. Colony sizes are highly variable, and range from less than 100 individuals to over 1 million, although least and crested auklets tend to nest in greater density than parakeet and whiskered auklets.\n\nThe auklets are mainly planktivores, eating a variety of calanoid copepods, euphausiids and other invertebrates such as jellyfish and ctenophores. Winter diet has not been studied.\n\nBecause they nest in crevices, auklets are vulnerable to predation by rats, and have been extirpated from some islands that contained Arctic foxes introduced for farming. Eradication of rats from Rat Island was completed in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe large colony at Sirius Point, Kiska Island, Alaska (perhaps the largest auklet colony in the world) experienced almost complete breeding failure in 2001 and 2002 because of rat predation and disturbance and has been the focus of researchers at Memorial University of Newfoundland.\n", "id": "7700644", "categories": ["Bird genera", "Aethia"], "title": "Aethia"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700689", "text": "Peter Ilsted\n\nPeter Ilsted (14 February 1861 – 16 April 1933) was a leading Danish artist and printmaker. He was most associated with domestic interior scenes.\nPeter Vilhelm Ilsted was born at Sakskøbing in Guldborgsund, Denmark. He was the son of merchant Jens Peter Ilsted and Johanne Sophie Lund. He was the brother-in-law of painter Vilhelm Hammershøi (1864–1916). He married Ingeborg Lovisa Petersen (1869-1945) in 1891.\n\nHe came to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1878, completing his course of study in five years. He made his debut at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1883. Two years later, he joined a study trip across Italy to Egypt, Palestine, Greece and Turkey. Later he visited Scotland, England, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Morocco and France. With support from the Cultural Ministry, he traveled to the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris. He was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1890 and 1899. He became an assistant at the Royal Danish Academy from 1893-1905 and worked periodically as a conservator-restorer. Ilsted died in Copenhagen during 1933.\n\nPeter Ilsted and Vilhelm Hammershøi, together with Carl Holsøe (1863–1935), were leading artists in early 20th-century Denmark. All three artists were members of the Free Exhibitions (\"Den Frie Udstilling\"), a progressive artists association founded in 1891. They are famous for painting images of \"Sunshine and Silent Rooms\", all in subtle colors. Their works reflect the orderliness of a tranquil life — similar to the earlier works of Vermeer. Their art was later referred to as the ‘Copenhagen Interior School’. These interiors evoke at once a sense of calm and mystery. The orderly rooms are often viewed from behind—causing one to wonder whether the scenes are really tranquil. James McNeill Whistler, Duret and important art critics were early admirers and collectors of Ilsted’s works.\nWhile at first glance their work appears similar, Ilsted and Hammershøi were in fact quite different. Hammershøi’s work has an aloof austerity, in contrast to Ilsted's scenes of common life. Though sometimes Hammershøi’s colorful early pictures are reminiscent of James Tissot (1836–1902), his work is quintessentially Danish. However, Ilsted was more of a technician, and he made considerable contributions in the field of graphic arts. Ilsted’s mezzotints (sometimes printed in colour à la poupeé) were very popular and important in his day. They were an innovation in the media. Ilsted exhibited his work all over Europe, in London in 1907, in Germany and at the Paris Salon, where Europe’s art community was first exposed to his work.\n\nIlsted was a great success in his lifetime and won many awards and accolades for his work. He was the only member of the group to also focus on printmaking. Ilsted’s achievements in mezzotints were revolutionary. Some of his mezzotints, most of which were created in black as well as color editions, are considered among the greatest ever made. His greatest contribution, which T. F. Šimon (187-1942), Manuel Robbe (1872- 1936), and others seemingly adopted was that of inking the plate \"à la poupée\". Some art historians have argued that these three men created the technique at about the same time but without consultation. This is uncertain.\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York) held an important exhibition on the work of Ilsted, Hammershøi, and Vermeer in 2001.\n\n", "id": "7700689", "categories": ["Danish male painters", "People from Guldborgsund Municipality", "20th-century Danish painters", "19th-century Danish painters", "1861 births", "1933 deaths"], "title": "Peter Ilsted"}

Moored buoys have been in use since 1951, while drifting buoys have been used since 1979. Moored buoys are connected with the ocean bottom using either chains, nylon, or buoyant polypropylene. With the decline of the weather ship, they have taken a more primary role in measuring conditions over the open seas since the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s, a network of buoys in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean helped study the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Moored weather buoys range from in diameter, while drifting buoys are smaller, with diameters of . Drifting buoys are the dominant form of weather buoy in sheer number, with 1250 located worldwide. Wind data from buoys has smaller error than that from ships. There are differences in the values of sea surface temperature measurements between the two platforms as well, relating to the depth of the measurement and whether or not the water is heated by the ship which measures the quantity.\n\nThe first known proposal for surface weather observations at sea occurred in connection with aviation in August 1927, when Grover Loening stated that \"weather stations along the ocean coupled with the development of the seaplane to have an equally long range, would result in regular ocean flights within ten years.\" Starting in 1939, United States Coast Guard vessels were being used as weather ships to protect transatlantic air commerce.\n\nDuring World War II The German Navy deployed weather buoys (\"Wetterfunkgerät See\" — WFS) at fifteen fixed positions in the North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by the length of the anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.\n\nThe Navy Oceanographic Meteorological Automatic Device (NOMAD) buoy's hull was originally designed in the 1940s for the United States Navy’s offshore data collection program. The United States Navy tested marine automatic weather stations for hurricane conditions between 1956 and 1958, though radio transmission range and battery life was limited. Between 1951 and 1970, a total of 21 NOMAD buoys were built and deployed at sea. Since the 1970s, weather buoy use has superseded the role of weather ships, as they are cheaper to operate and maintain. The earliest reported use of drifting buoys was to study the behavior of ocean currents within the Sargasso Sea in 1972 and 1973. Drifting buoys have been used increasingly since 1979, and as of 2005, 1250 drifting buoys roamed the Earth's oceans.\n\nBetween 1985 and 1994, an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean to monitor and help predict the El Niño phenomenon. Hurricane Katrina capsized a buoy for the first time in the history of the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) on August 28, 2005. On June 13, 2006, drifting buoy 26028 ended its long-term data collection of sea surface temperature after transmitting for 10 years, 4 months, and 16 days, which is the longest known data collection time for any drifting buoy. The first weather buoy in the Southern Ocean was deployed by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) on March 17, 2010.\n\nWeather buoys, like other types of weather stations, measure parameters such as air temperature above the ocean surface, wind speed (steady and gusting), barometric pressure, and wind direction. Since they lie in oceans and lakes, they also measure water temperature, wave height, and dominant wave period. Raw data is processed and can be logged on board the buoy and then transmitted via radio, cellular, or satellite communications to meteorological centers for use in weather forecasting and climate study. Both moored buoys and drifting buoys (drifting in the open ocean currents) are used. Fixed buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of . Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies. These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution. Other than their use as a source of meteorological data, their data is used within research programs, emergency response to chemical spills, legal proceedings, and engineering design. Moored weather buoys can also act as a navigational aid, like other types of buoys.\n\nWeather buoys range in diameter from . Those that are placed in shallow waters are smaller in size and moored using only chains, while those in deeper waters use a combination of chains, nylon, and buoyant polypropylene. Since they do not have direct navigational significance, moored weather buoys are classed as special marks under the IALA scheme, are coloured yellow, and display a yellow flashing light at night.\n\nDiscus buoys are round and moored in deep ocean locations, with a diameter of . The aluminum buoy is a very rugged meteorological ocean platform that has long term survivability. The expected service life of the platform is in excess of 20 years and properly maintained, these buoys have not been retired due to corrosion. The NOMAD is a unique moored aluminum environmental monitoring buoy designed for deployments in extreme conditions near the coast and across the Great Lakes. NOMADs moored off the Atlantic Canadian coast commonly experience winter storms with maximum wave heights approaching into the Gulf of Maine.\n\nA large network of coastal buoys near the United States is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center, with deployment and maintenance performed by the United States Coast Guard. For South Africa, the South African Weather Service deploys and retrieves their own buoys, while the Meteorological Service of New Zealand performs the same task for their country. Environment Canada operates and deploys buoys for their country. The Met Office in Great Britain deploys drifting buoys across both the northern and southern Atlantic oceans.\n\nWind reports from moored buoys have smaller error than those from ships. Complicating the comparison of the two measurements are that NOMAD buoys report winds at a height of , while ships report winds from a height of . Sea surface temperature measured in the intake port of large ships have a warm bias of around due to the heat of the engine room. This bias has led to changes in the perception of global warming since 2000. Fixed buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of .\n\n", "id": "7700692", "categories": ["Oceanographic instrumentation", "Meteorological data and networks", "1951 introductions", "Nautical terminology"], "title": "Weather buoy"}

It is based at Dover Air Force Base near Dover, Delaware.\n\nThe squadron goes back to the days of World War II when it was activated at Pope Field, North Carolina, in March 1942, as the 3d Air Corps Ferrying Squadron. Two months later, the 3d moved to India, where it was stationed at Chabua Airfield, Upper Assam, India. It was part of the India-China Wing of Air Transport Command and carried supplies and equipment back and forth across The Hump. The squadron was disbanded in late 1943.\n\nDuring the Korean War, the 3rd was reconstituted at Brookley Air Force Base, Alabama as the 3d Air Transport Squadron, and began flying regularly scheduled airlift missions in its eight Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs to the Arctic, Caribbean, and South America. In June 1958, the squadron moved to Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, where it continued to fly C-124s until August 1965, when it transitioned into jets with the arrival of the first Lockheed C-141 Starlifter.\n\nIn June 1970, the squadron, now the 3rd Military Airlift Squadron received the first operational Lockheed C-5 Galaxy to be assigned to a Military Airlift Command (MAC) flying organization. Three years later, the 3d moved to its present home with the 436th Airlift Wing at Dover Air Force Base. Aircrews of the 3d flew support missions for French troops in the Zaire peacekeeping effort. For their efforts, they were co-recipients with a 9th Military Airlift Squadron crew of the Mackay Trophy for the 1978 airlift operation. The 3d proved itself and the C-5 by setting MAC records for departure reliability. In 1986, the 3d received the 436th Military Airlift Wing's Flying Eagle award four times for having the highest percentage of on-time departures in the wing.\n\nIn April 1988, a 3d crew, overcoming the difficulties of flying into unfamiliar territory, airlifted drilling equipment into Semipalitinsk, in the Soviet Union. The mission was part of a joint nuclear weapons detonation monitoring agreement signed by the United States and the Soviet Union. The crew was subsequently awarded the Mackay Trophy for the \"most meritorious flight of the year\".\n\nThe 3rd continues its distinct history and support of Air Mobility Command by flying humanitarian and contingency missions into such places as Southwest Asia, Somalia, Rwanda, and Haiti. The squadron participated in the first-ever six-ship formation flights of C-5's in support of the Strategic Brigade Airdrop Test. In October 2003 a crew from the 3rd Airlift Squadron landed the first Galaxy in Iraq at Baghdad International Airport. Until 2004 the unit was also the only Special Operations Low Level capable unit to fly the C-5 Galaxy. This capability was transferred to the smaller and more modern C-17 in 2001.\n\nIn 2007 the 3rd Squadron transitioned from operation of the C-5 to the newer Boeing C-17 Globemaster III.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7700705", "categories": ["Airlift squadrons of the United States Air Force"], "title": "3d Airlift Squadron"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700797", "text": "Brothers Grimm (comics)\n\nThe Brothers Grimm are two sets of fictional twin supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nThe first appearance of the first Brothers Grimm came in \"Spider-Woman\" #3. These were a pair of identical, magically animated mannequins created by doll collector Nathan Dolly (also known as Mister Doll) and his wife Priscilla. During their initial appearances only one was ever seen at a time and the singular identity, Brother Grimm was used instead of their true plural name. After three return appearances in \"Spider-Woman\", they perished in issue #12. Though the characters were introduced while Marv Wolfman was writing \"Spider-Woman\", their origin and identities were not revealed until Mark Gruenwald's run on the series. Questioned as to whether he had told Gruenwald the characters' origin or Gruenwald had come up with it himself, Wolfman admitted that he could not even remember if the origin he had originally envisioned for the characters was the same as the one ultimately used by Gruenwald, except that \"Brother Grimm\" actually being two people was his intention from the beginning. Though Wolfman could not remember how the Brothers Grimm were created, he has said he is confident that their visual design must have come from series penciler Carmine Infantino: \"I usually gave the artist a concept of what I wanted and then let them have a field day with it. Carmine created brilliant designs in \"The Flash\", so I would certainly have bowed to his expertise.\"\n\nThe second Brothers Grimm appeared in \"Iron Man\" #188. They would eventually be thrown together with other lesser known super-villains in a group called the Night Shift.\n\nMister Doll was a criminal who could mystically harm a person by harming a doll whose features he could reshape to resemble the victim's. Later, in the process of creating the Brothers Grimm dolls, Nathan's consciousness was trapped simultaneously inside both doll mannequins. These mannequins mailed themselves to Nathan's wife Priscilla and transferred their life forces into two life size versions. She named them Jake and William (after the historical Brothers Grimm), and believed them to be her sons, a delusion which they played along with.\n\nThe \"brothers\" had sharply opposed personalities, rarely could come to agreement, and as such pursued separate criminal careers. William, though timid and shy in his civilian personality, was a flamboyant, confrontational jokester in his Brother Grimm guise. After debuting with a robbery of a theatre, he pursued the more lucrative pursuit of stealing from diamond merchants. In contrast, Jake was flirtatious in his civilian identity but cold and dispassionate as Brother Grimm, preferring less publicly visible crimes such as extortion. He was also less skilled with his abilities than William; while William was able to consistently defeat Spider-Woman, Jake was defeated in both his confrontations with her, and William had to free him from prison. William was later hired by Pyrotechnics to capture Spider-Woman, and succeeded.\n\nPriscilla planned to use her occult knowledge to transfer Nathan's mind from the mannequins to a living human body. To this end, Jake abducted Jerry Hunt to use for the body, and William captured Spider-Woman to coerce Magnus the Sorcerer to perform the transfer. Spider-Woman pulled Hunt out of the spell at the last moment, and Nathan's consciousness dispersed.\n\nTwin brothers Percy and Barton Grimes are born in Fresno, California. They work as realtors, and while exploring a theatre they own, they find the original Brothers Grimm mannequins. On a whim, they decide to try the costumes on and become gifted with the powers of the original pair. As the Brothers Grimm, they terrorize a restaurant belonging to a business rival, and then battle Iron Man II. Tony Stark deduced their true civilian identities, and the police arrested the brothers.\n\nThe Brothers Grimm later became professional criminals, and join the Night Shift, and team with Captain America against the Power Broker and his augmented mutates. With the rest of the Night Shift, the Brothers test Moon Knight to take over as their leader. Alongside the Night Shift, they next battle the West Coast Avengers. The Brothers Grimm are among a large group of supervillains who attack Hawkeye, Mockingbird, and Trick Shot in an attempt to collect the reward being paid by Crossfire to the first person who gives him Hawkeye's arm.\n\nDuring the \"Acts of Vengeance\" storyline, the Brothers Grimm are freed from prison by the Wizard. They battle a cosmic-powered Spider-Man and are defeated. Alongside Graviton, Titania, Trapster, and Goliath IV, the Brothers are hired by the Chameleon to kill Spider-Man. They are then tricked into attacking the Kingpin and defeated by Spider-Man. Alongside Mockingbird and the Werewolf, they help the Shroud defeat a street gang.\n\nThe Brothers then briefly rejoin the Night Shift, under the leadership of the new Hangman, and the Night Shift's powers are increased by Satannish. They battle the Avengers West Coast again, but are defeated.\n\nThe Brothers are later depicted as prisoners in the Raft, a high security prison for costumed criminals, and escape.\n\nThe Brothers Grimm are later hired by the Hood to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. They are later captured by Nighthawk and Gargoyle and sent back to jail.\n\nIn Secret Invasion, the Brothers Grimm appear as part of the Hood's alliance with super-powered heroes; the grouping is intent on defeating the Skrull invasion force of New York City. They are later seen as part of the Hood's criminal gang that is sent by Norman Osborn to attack the New Avengers.\n\nThe Brothers Grimm are seen to be among the new recruits for Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.. Tigra beats Percy severely, and leaves a note for his brother reading, \"You're next.\"\n\nThe Brothers Grimm were seen during the battle of Camp H.A.M.M.E.R., until the Hood ordered his men, including the Brothers Grimm, to teleport to aid Osborn in Siege of Asgard. After the battle was over, the Brothers Grimm were arrested along with other members of the Hood's gang.\n\nThe Brothers Grimm were later recruited by Max Fury to join the Shadow Council's incarnation of the Masters of Evil.\n\nThe Brothers Grimm were among the criminals who attempted to fulfill a lucrative contract Daredevil put out on himself, but were quickly defeated by him.\n\nDuring the \"Search for Tony Stark\" arc, the Brothers Grimm rejoined Hood's gang and assisted in the attack on Castle Doom.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Geddon\" storyline, the Brothers Grimm are with Night Shift members Dansen Macabre, Digger, Skein, and new member Waxman when they rob a bus until they are attacked by Superior Octopus. Superior Octopus agrees to spare them more pain in exchange that the Night Shift becomes his agents where he will compensate them from his own funds. They agree to the terms and are ordered to return the stolen items. Superior Octopus leaves advising them never to cross him or they won't live long enough to regret it.\n\nBoth pairs of Brothers Grimm had powers which were somehow related to the Brothers Grimm mannequins built by Nathan Dolly. Both pairs of Brothers Grimm possess the ability to conjure, with the appearance of sleight of hand, a variety of small novelty items from within their costumes. Each of these items has a unique offensive capability; long strands of nearly unbreakable thread, corrosive filled eggs, pies filled with blackbirds, paralytic \"stardust\", fast-growing bean seeds, and many others have been used. They could also emit poisonous smoke from their hands. They could fly by means of floating five-pointed \"stars\" and small cloud banks which are somehow solid enough to stand on.\n\n", "id": "7700797", "categories": ["Fictional real estate brokers", "Characters created by Carmine Infantino", "Characters created by Dennis O'Neil", "Marvel Comics characters who use magic", "Characters created by Marv Wolfman", "Fictional characters from California", "Comics characters introduced in 1984", "Fresno, California in fiction", "Comics characters introduced in 1978"], "title": "Brothers Grimm (comics)"}

Its designated seat of government was Datu Odin Sinsuat. Initially comprising ten municipalities carved out of Maguindanao, Shariff Kabunsuan was created by virtue of \"Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 201\"; this law was nullified by the Supreme Court of the Philippines in 2008, thus disestablishing the province.\n\nShariff Kabunsuan was established under \"Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 201\" which provided for the creation of the new province comprising the nine municipalities of Barira, Buldon, Datu Odin Sinsuat, Kabuntalan, Matanog, Parang, Sultan Kudarat, Sultan Mastura, and Upi, all of the first legislative district of the mother province of Maguindanao. A tenth municipality, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, was created within the proposed province on 16 September 2006, weeks prior to the actual plebiscite for the creation of the province.\n\nThe plebiscite for the creation of the province was held on 28 October 2006. Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 201 was ratified by the affirmative majority (285,372) votes cast in a plebiscite, thus establishing the province. Only 8,802 voted for its rejection.\n\nThe law establishing Shariff Kabunsuan was enacted by the Regional Assembly for the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, the first such province established by that local body, which had been so empowered under \"Republic Act No. 9054\" or the \"Expanded ARMM\" law. Shariff Kabunsuan was the first province since Philippine independence that was not established through an Act of Congress.\n\nAt the time of its creation, Shariff Kabunsuan was the Philippines' 80th province and the sixth in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The province was named after Shariff Mohammed Kabungsuwan, an Arab-Malay Islamic preacher who introduced Islam to central Mindanao in the 16th century.\n\nAn eleventh municipality was established two months after: the creation of Northern Kabuntalan by virtue of Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 205 was affirmed in a plebiscite held on 30 December 2006.\n\nDatu Odin Sinsuat was designated the capital of the new province, per Section 1 of MMA Act 201. Cotabato City, which is an independent city that does not vote for provincial officials, belongs to neither Maguindanao nor Shariff Kabunsuan. However, for the purposes of congressional representation the said city was grouped with Shariff Kabunsuan, as per Section 5 of MMA Act No. 201. This specific provision became the subject of the Supreme Court case that led to the disestablishment of the province.\n\nOn 17 July 2008, the Supreme Court, in \"Sema v. Comelec\" declared the creation of the province of Shariff Kabunsuan void and ruled that the power of ARMM's legislature to create provinces and cities is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court in particular held that only the Congress of the Philippines was empowered to create provinces and cities because the creation of such necessarily included the power to create legislative districts, which explicitly under the Philippine Constitution was within the sole prerogative of Congress to establish. Consequently, the Court also declared the power of the Regional Assembly to create provinces and cities within the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao as unconstitutional.\n\nDespite a motion for reconsideration filed by ARMM officials, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its ruling in January 2009, thereby rendering its decision as final.\n\nShariff Kabunsuan was composed of 11 municipalities distributed between two Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts:\n\n\n", "id": "7700893", "categories": ["States and territories disestablished in 2008", "Former provinces of the Philippines", "2006 establishments in the Philippines", "2008 disestablishments in the Philippines"], "title": "Shariff Kabunsuan"}

Lewis was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970 as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales and is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church.\n\nLewis, the youngest of nine children of Anglican Reverend Morgan Lewis, the headmaster of a grammar school, and Margaret Pritchard, a Catholic, was born at Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, Wales, in 1616.\n\nAt 16 years of age, while visiting Paris, he converted to Catholicism from Anglicanism and subsequently went to study at the English College in Rome, where he assumed the alias \"Charles Baker\", a common practice to avoid spies and informers in the employ of the Crown. He was ordained a Catholic priest on 20 July 1642. Three years later, he joined the Society of Jesus.\nHe came back to his native place and worked for a year and then he was appointed \"the Spiritual Director to the seminarians at the English College\" in Rome. After his mission in Rome had been completed he came back to Wales and was working for 30 years in the apostolate paying much attention to the poor people and people in need.\n\nHe was arrested on 17 November 1678 at St Michael's Church, Llantarnam, then in Monmouthshire, and condemned at the Assizes in Monmouth in March 1679 as a Catholic priest and for saying Catholic Masses. He was being accused of attempting to kill Charles II and trying to restore Catholic faith in the land of Wales. He was betrayed by an apostate couple who had been promised an award of 50 pounds for the Jesuit's capture, and another sum of 200 pounds was promised by a Welsh magistrate to those who could help in his exposure. Like John Wall and John Kemble, he was then sent to London to be examined by Titus Oates (the originator of the Popish Plot) and other informers.\n\nHe was brought for trial at the Lenten Assizes in Monmouth on 16 March 1679. He was brought to the bar on a charge of high treason – for having become a Catholic priest and then remaining in England, contrary to the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to the charge of being an accessory to the Popish Plot, but five or six witnesses claimed they had seen him say Mass and perform other priestly duties. For this Lewis was found guilty and sentenced to death by Sir Robert Atkyns. The condemned priest was brought to Newgate Prison in London with John Kemble (Herefordshire) and questioned about the \"plot\". Oates and his fellow informers William Bedloe, Stephen Dugdale and Miles Prance were unable to prove anything against him. Lord Shaftesbury advised him that if he gave evidence about the \"plot\" or renounced his Catholic faith, that his life would be spared and he would be greatly rewarded. Lewis said in his dying speech, \"discover the plot I could not, as I knew of none; and conform I would not, for it was against my conscience\".His last words before execution were very touching and full of faith:\nHe was finally brought back to Usk in Monmouthshire for his execution by John Arnold of Monmouthshire, prayed at the Gunter Mansion and was hanged on 27 August 1679 and then posthumously disemboweled. It was a tribute to the great esteem in which he was held that the crowd, who were mainly Protestants, insisted that he be allowed to hang until he was dead, and that he receive a proper burial. The Sheriff, who knew and liked Lewis, registered a silent protest by refusing to attend the execution, which he had postponed for as long as he could.\n\nAfter the Titus Oates affair (1679–80), the remaining Welsh-speaking Catholic clergy were either executed or exiled. Lewis was the last Welshman to become a Jesuit until 2001, more than 300 years later.\n\nTogether with John Wall, John Kemble and 37 other martyrs, David Lewis was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970 – the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. In November 2007, a plaque was erected on the spot where Lewis was arrested near Llantarnam Abbey.\n\n\n", "id": "7700914", "categories": ["People executed by Stuart England by hanging, drawing and quartering", "Victims of the Popish Plot", "People from Abergavenny", "1679 deaths", "Converts to Roman Catholicism from Anglicanism", "Welsh Roman Catholic priests", "1616 births", "Executed Welsh people", "Welsh Jesuits", "17th-century Roman Catholic martyrs", "Jesuit martyrs", "Forty Martyrs of England and Wales", "17th-century Jesuits", "Jesuit saints", "English Roman Catholics", "17th-century Christian saints", "17th-century Roman Catholic priests"], "title": "David Lewis (Jesuit priest)"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700918", "text": "Manikata\n\nManikata is a small village in the limits of Mellieħa in the northwestern part of Malta. It oversees the farming areas in the valley between il-Ballut and il-Manikata. Population 539, Families 40.\n\nThe main industry of Manikata is farming. The valleys around this village are rich in produce. All year round the fields are tended and the produce is enjoyed by many. Grapes, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, melons (bettiegħ), water melons (dulliegħ), apples, oranges, pomegranates (rummien), strawberries and many other crops are commonly seen in the fields. Also there are many beekeepers in this area.\n\nLiterally translates into “Apple’s Spring”. It is located just east of Golden Bay, one of three bays (Gnejna Bay, Għajn Tuffieħa & Golden Bay) carved out of the cliffs. It is situated at the bottom of Wied tal-Pwales (Pwales stream.) The sea is deep blue and aquamarine water interspersed with emerald and white stretches of sand.\n\nGolden Bay (Il-Mixquqa) is another one of the few sandy beaches located on the southern coast of Malta. The sand at the edge of the water at this bay is peppered with small pebbles and reaching the water can be tricky. The water here can be quite rough at times. As you swim away from the beach, the currents can be quite strong. This is one of the best places for sunsets on the Maltese islands. The water shimmers as the sun hits the horizon. \n\nA lot of cart ruts are found around Manikata. These probably date to a period between the Bronze Age and the Roman Era. One particular line of cart ruts surfaces from under the trees in the Miżieb area, proceeds towards the parish church and goes towards the cliffs hanging above Mejjiesa Bay.\n\nIn the area of Il-Ġnien ta’ Għajn Tuffieħa there are the remains of Roman baths that formed part of a rural villa. Nearer to Manikata there are several Roman tombs. Some of them have been obliterated when people cut across the cliff side to level the ground and make space for their fields. Other tombs are found in caves and have been modified by subsequent cave inhabitants to be used as storage space. Some tombs were used as air-raid shelters during World War Two.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the lands at Għajn Tuffieħa and Manikata were used for the cultivation of crops and fruit trees. Fields belonged to land owners from the capital city, Mdina, and its suburb, Rabat. The farmers usually inhabited the caves in the vicinity. The caves also housed sheep, goats and oxen. People also used to come here to collect fire wood. A night watch was kept over the sea cliffs of Għajn Tuffieħa by men from Mosta forming part of the civil corps called Dejma.\n\nOn the 18th of May 1565 the Turkish fleet anchored in the bays around Manikata, namely Mejjiesa, Mixquqa (Golden Bay), Għajn Tuffieħa and Ġnejna. The following day it arrived at Marsaxlokk Bay to the South East where Turkish soldiers landed to begin their assault on Birgu, the general headquarters of the Order.\n\nIn 1637, Grand Master Lascaris came to Għajn Tuffieħa to lay the foundation stone of Għajn Tuffieħa Tower. Grand Master Lascaris also built other watch towers at Ġnejna, Qawra and Binġemma. He also built Saint Agatha's Tower, the red tower dominating Mellieħa Bay.\n\nTowards the end of the Order’s reign, coastal entrenchments were built over Mixquqa Bay (Golden Bay), near modern-day Golden Sands Hotel. These were meant to prevent enemy troops from landing on the sandy beach below\n\nFrom 1902 onwards, a number of farmers in Manikata and Għajn Tuffieħa lost a vast amount of agricultural land which was taken over by the Admiralty for the construction of a Royal Marines Training Centre. The Għajn Tuffieħa Camp consisted of shooting ranges and residential quarters for soldiers, their families and camp officials. During World War One (1914-1917) the camp was covered in tents and used as a military hospital to cure wounded soldiers that were brought here from the war front. People from Manikata used to work in this emergency hospital as nurses. \n\nIn 1935 Benito Mussolini, the Fascist ruler of Italy, invaded Abbisinia (modern Ethiopia) in Africa. The British suspected that Mussolini would attempt to invade Malta. So, they built a number of coastal defences called beach posts. These were built of concrete and camouflaged with rubble walls. Two such beach posts were built in Manikata in 1935, one near Għajn Tuffieħa Tower and one near the Razzett tal-Qasam. When the Second World War eventually broke out, more beach posts were built along the coast. These were provided with a search light in order to spot enemy aircraft. Over Għajn Tuffieħa Gardens, an anti-aircraft battery was also built. Due to the presence of the Admiralty camp, Manikata was often a target during air-raids. The residents used to take shelter in rock-cut air-raid shelters, in caves or in Roman tombs.\n\nManikata is home to about 1000 inhabitants. New houses, apartments and villas have been built recently. People from different parts of the Maltese islands have come to live here in search of serenity and beautiful surroundings. Many local villagers are full-time or part-time farmers. Their fields are found in the surrounding areas known as il-Ġnien ta’ Għajn Tuffieħa (Għajn Tuffieħa Gardens), il-Wilġa ta’ Għajn Tuffieħa (Għajn Tuffieħa meadow), il-Miżieb (woodland) and ix-Xagħra l-Ħamra (The red garrigue). Every last Sunday in August the parish celebrates the feast of St.Joseph. On the eve of the parish feast, the local community celebrates Lejla Sajfija għaż-Żiffa, a Summer Breeze Night, where the villagers put their best talents and products on show, including songs, drama, paintings, hand crafts, vegetables, fruits, honey, wine, olive oil...\n\nIn the north-east of the Manikata church there is a medium barren land called Tal-Qargħa. This land contains a number of archaeological remains mainly cart-ruts, old quarry and walls built of large stones. In the land there is a girna and in the west of the structure there is a wall some 8 metres long and in it there are five large stones. Parallel to this wall there is another wall, which has six large stones. On top of the hill there is another wall and it there are three large stones, the largest one is 0.75m length and 0.6m breath. Apart from this wall there are another two built from large stones. It seems that during the Bronze Age period in this area there was a prehistoric village and it was defended by several walls against their enemies. The idea of building a village on a hill and surround it by a defensive wall is a typical characteristic of the Bronze Age Period, Borġ in-Nadur. This site has evidence of hut foundations and has the longest defensive wall of the Bronze Age Period. Borġ in-Nadur wall is the best preserved prehistoric fortification in Malta.\n\nA pillbox can be found built in Manikata at the rear of Għajn Tuffieħa Camp. Pillboxes were the last type of fortification to be built in Mellieħa and Malta. These types of military structures were constructed in nearly every part of the Island. It seems that the largest number of pillboxes was built in Mellieħa and fortunately the largest number of them survived to this day. The first building programme of pillboxes occurred in 1935.\n\nGħajn Tuffieħa Tower was built in 1637, on the top of the cliffs at the western edge of Għajn Tuffieħa Bay. During the Middle Ages il-Mahras maintained a watch-post in Għajn Tuffieħa, probably in the same site where the tower was built. This is one of the seven towers built by Grand Master Lascaris, during the times of the Knights of Malta. This tower has a longish shape and the ground floor room is larger than the second floor one. It was armed with ½-pdr cannon and was manned by four men, a captain and three men.\n\nUnfortunately, the cliffs around this Tower are eroding very badly. Serious cracks are visible on the surface of the cliffs near the Tower and huge holes can be seen on the wall of the cliffs. This tower may eventually collapse when the terrain on which it's built gives in.\n\nThe Old Chapel of St. Joseph was built in 1920, when there were only twelve families living in Manikata. A number of people from this tiny village helped to build this chapel. Locals recall how the soft, honey-coloured stone was brought from Qasam Barrani quarry, while stronger stone, for the arches was brought from quarries in the north of Mosta. But with the growth of Manikata to over five hundred people the chapel of St. Joseph, which seated only 100, became too small for the religious needs of the locals.\n\nIn 1961, it was decided to build a new and larger church, the rector Fr. Manwel Grima approached architect Edwin England Sant Fournier to prepare a design for the new church. However, shortly afterwards Edwin handed over the job to his son Richard England. The building of the new church of Manikata faced numerous problems. In 1962 the first stone was laid by Archbishop Sir Michael Gonzi, but after the death of Fr. Grima the church remained half built for five years. Finally Manikata’s new church was finished and blessed on 29 November 1974 by Archbishop Sir Michael Gonzi, more than ten years after he officially had laid the first stone.\n\nThe architect Richard England, who built the church took his inspiration from the \"girna\" which one sometimes sees in the middle of a field, a small stone building put up by farmers to store in it their implements.\n\nOn the outskirts of Manikata there were two military camps in the 1960s. One was home to Royal Malta Artillery and the other was a British Army camp which hosted many different regiments including the Royal Marines. These army camps are no longer active.\n\n\n", "id": "7700918", "categories": ["Towns in Malta"], "title": "Manikata"}

In a surprise move by the Colombian government, Mancuso, along with 13 other top members of the AUC was extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges.\n\nMancuso was born in Montería, the provincial capital of Córdoba Department, in the northern Colombian Caribbean Region. His father was an Italian immigrant from Sapri and his mother a Montería native. He is the second of six children. He studied civil engineering in the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and later farming administration in the \"Escuela de Formación Técnica Agrícola\" in Bogotá. He also studied English at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania.\n\nHe became a prominent landowner in Córdoba Department and in 1995 he joined the \"Autodefensas Campesinas de Córdoba y Urabá\" paramilitary group, citing being tired of guerrilla extortion and abuses that the Colombian authorities failed to prosecute. The attacks by the guerrillas to the estate owners in the region brought as a consequence the formation of illegally armed self-defense groups to confront them. This new movement had the sympathy of some sectors of the Colombian Government such as politicians and some security forces, including then-current and former members of the Colombian National Army. The group was originally under the command of Carlos Castaño, with Mancuso as his main Lieutenant.\n\nThe paramilitary groups in Colombia later expanded, and in April 1997 created what was known as \"Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia\" (AUC), an umbrella organization under the leadership of the \"\"Autodefensas Campesinas de Córdoba y Urabá\"\" led by Mancuso and Castaño. Following the death of Castaño, Mancuso became the strong man, along with Castaño's brother Vicente and, consequently, the main leader in the peace process with the Colombian government of president Álvaro Uribe.\n\nHis name has been involved in the command of at least eight paramilitary groups that perpetrated several massacres such as Mapiripán. On September 24, 2002 Salvatore Mancuso and Juan Carlos Sierra Ramirez were formally charged by the Colombian and the American governments for narcotrafficking. The US Government applied for his extradition to the United States in order to be judged by an American court. Marcuso was so unconcerned about it that he attended the ceremony of the \"Bloque Bananero\"'s demobilization, following the peace process with the Colombian State on November 24, 2004. The extradition application was initially accepted by government of Colombia, but soon was suspended to complete the demobilization process of the AUC. Mancuso demobilized officially and surrendered to the Colombian authorities in the \"Bloque Catatumbo\"'s demobilization ceremony on December 10, 2006. Gonzo author Matthew Thompson describes his 2006 meeting with Mancuso in Montería in \"My Colombian Death\" (2008).\n\nOn January 15, 2007, Mancuso admitted his crimes to a Colombian court following a deal that his attorneys were pursuing to preclude his extradition to the United States for drug trafficking. According to the country's Justice and Peace Law, Mancuso should reveal trafficking routes and drug contacts in order to completely fulfill the deal.\n\nDuring his Colombian imprisonment, Mancuso had his own website and criticized the Colombian government, led by Álvaro Uribe Vélez on numerous occasions. Many politicians, members of the National Army and government officials, he claimed, had links with the AUC.\n\nIn the early morning of May 13, 2008, Mancuso and thirteen other paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the Colombian government. According to Colombian Interior Minister Carlos Holguín they had been refusing to comply to the country's Peace and Justice law and were therefore extradited to the United States. During his first appearance before the District of Columbia Court, Mancuso refused to speak after having said his name. His lawyer pleaded not guilty for him.\n\nThe National Movement of State Crimes, a coalition of several victim organizations that have suffered from state or paramilitary violence, has asked \"to return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the Law of Justice and Peace, since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims, since they have not told all of the truth, have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims, and have not dismantled their criminal structures.\" \n\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia stated that \"[...] according to Colombian law, the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previously-suspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the ‘Law of Justice and Peace’ and for the loss of the benefits established therein\".\n\nThe Inter-American Commission stated that this \"affects the Colombian State's obligation to guarantee victims’ rights to truth, justice, and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups. The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice system's regular criminal procedures. It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict, and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused. This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders.\" . A 2016 investigation by the New York Times found that the extradited paramilitaries, including Mancuso, had been given special treatment by the US justice system, serving shorter sentences than would be expected for drug-trafficking offences of that magnitude; a number of judges and prosecutors involved in trying the cases publicly stated their admiration for the political cause of the AUC, which they saw as a mitigating factor.\n\nAfter his extradition to the United States, Colombian paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso has continued to testify via satellite as part of the Justice and Peace process. On November 18, 2008, Revista Semana reported on Mancuso's declarations about the 1997 El Aro massacre, in which he stated that the AUC had received logistical help from the Colombian military and police.\n\nMancuso testified that in the early 2000s, the AUC had met with anti-Chavez factions in Venezuela to discuss the AUC possibly operating against the Chavez government.\n\nImmediately after his extradition Colombian police seized Mancuso's luxury ranches, farms and plots of land, with a combined property value of US$25 million.\n\nOn June 5, 2008 Several Colombian media reported police in Montería found a suitcase allegedly containing Mancuso's shadow administration, revealing more property owned by the warlord through secret associates.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7700942", "categories": ["Members of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia", "People from Córdoba Department", "Colombian people of Italian descent", "Warlords", "1964 births", "Colombian drug traffickers", "Colombian people imprisoned abroad", "Living people", "Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government", "People of Campanian descent"], "title": "Salvatore Mancuso"}

Lyman Run Lake is a man-made lake within the park, surrounded by a northern hardwood forest of mainly maple and cherry trees. Lyman Run State Park is west of Galeton and east of Coudersport, and is nearly completely surrounded by the Susquehannock State Forest.\n\nLyman Run State Park is named for the creek that runs through it, which is dammed to form Lyman Run Lake. Major Isaac Lyman, an American Revolutionary War veteran was one of the first permanent settlers in Potter County. Major Lyman is recognized as the founder of Potter County. He was paid ten dollars for each settler that he convinced to move to Potter County. He built his home in 1809 in nearby Lymansville, now known as Ladonna. Major Lyman also built the first road to cross Potter County and the county's first sawmill and gristmill.\n\nLyman had a colorful personal history. Isaac was married three times and had 17 children. His first wife (Sally Edgecomb Lyman) died in 1791. He divorced his second wife (Laura Pierce Lyman) and started a third family in Potter County with his third wife (Patience Mann Spafford Lyman). The second Mrs. Lyman was determined not to suffer on her own. She sought out the Major, traveled to Potter County, with the help of her son, Burrell who was 18 at the time, and settled. Major Lyman lived with his two families in Potter County. Historical accounts of the living situation vary. Some say that Lyman kept both wives under one roof. Others state that there were two log homes for the families on the same piece of property. The descendants of Major Isaac Lyman still live and work in Potter County.\n\nThe Lyman Run area was part of the massive lumbering operation that occurred in most of north central Pennsylvania in the 1880s and 1890s. The land near Lyman Run was purchased by Frank and Charles Goodyear. The Goodyear brothers owned a railroad and lumber company that harvested the old-growth white pine and hemlock. These logs were floated down Lyman Run to the log boom at Williamsport by way of the West Branch of Pine Creek, then Pine Creek itself, and finally the West Branch Susquehanna River.\n\nIn the 1930s, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was built at what later became Lyman Run State Park. The grounds of the former CCC camp became a prisoner of war camp toward the end of World War II, with German prisoners of war detained by the U.S. Military there. In 1951, construction began on the state park facilities. In 2000 the park became part of the Hills Creek State Park complex, an administrative grouping of eight state parks in Potter and Tioga counties.\n\nCamping at both modern and rustic campsites is available at Lyman Run State Park. There are twenty-nine campsites equipped with electricity for RV's. Each site has a fire ring, picnic table and lantern hanger. There is a sanitary dump station at the campground. Those interested in camping out in tents may use one of six walk-in rustic camping areas. These locations have outhouses and hand-operated water pumps.\nIn addition to the picnic tables at the campsites, Lyman Run State Park has a central, shaded picnic area. There are charcoal grills, outhouses, and a play area. Drinking water is available at hand-operated pumps. There is one picnic pavilion on the grounds.\n\nLyman Run State Park has of hiking trails, which connect with the much larger system of trails in the adjoining Susquehannock State Forest. It is a northern access point for the Susquehannock Trail System (STS), an loop trail almost entirely on state forest land. The STS runs west of the park, and is reached via an access trail from the southwest end of the lake.\n\nHunting is permitted on about of Lyman Run State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, squirrels, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, and black bears. The hunting of groundhogs is not permitted at the park. Many more acres of forested woodlands are available for hunting on the grounds of the adjacent Susquehannock State Forest.\n\nBoating with gas powered motors is prohibited on Lyman Run Lake. Motorized boats must be powered by electric motors only. Rowboats, canoes and kayaks are permitted on the waters of the lake. All boats must be properly registered with the state.\n\nLyman Run Lake is a popular fishing lake, with exceptional water quality. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat commission stocks the lake with rainbow and palomino trout during the fishing season.\n\nIn winter, ice fishing for trout is permitted. The thickness of the ice is not monitored, but should be at least thick before venturing out on it. Ice skating is allowed when the ice is thick enough, but limited to the beach area.\n\nSwimming is permitted in Lyman Run Lake. The swimming season opens on Memorial Day weekend and concludes on Labor Day weekend. Beginning in 2008 lifeguards will not be posted at the beach.\n\nThe following state parks are within of Lyman Run State Park:\n", "id": "7700958", "categories": ["Civilian Conservation Corps in Pennsylvania", "State parks of Pennsylvania", "Parks in Potter County, Pennsylvania", "Protected areas established in 1951", "Campgrounds in Pennsylvania"], "title": "Lyman Run State Park"}

It is owned by Macerich, and was developed by Westcor. The anchors at the mall are Dillard's, JCPenney, and Macy's. The mall also has a freestanding Cheesecake Factory. The mall features an outdoor amphitheatre and a fountain that converts into a stage featuring free concerts from May to August on Saturday evenings.\n\nSuperstition Springs Center was built and completed in 1990, and was jointly developed and owned by Westcor and General Growth Properties. The original architect was Rafique Islam.When it first opened, most of the area surrounding the mall was open fields. At the time, it rested at the end of a freeway (U.S. Route 60), and was considered too far away from developed areas to be successful. However, since its opening, the area around Superstition Springs Center has seen significant growth; as of 2009, it held an estimated population of 337,000 in its primary trade area.\n\nIn February 2002, the mall underwent remodeling to include exterior paint and lighting, interior paint, flooring, and lighting to create a new refined atmosphere with color, texture and regional imagery.\n\nOriginally majority owned and managed by Westcor (two-thirds share, with General Growth Properties owning the other third), in 2002 Superstition Springs Center became part of Macerich’s portfolio, who still owns it to this date. In June 2011, GGP sold its 1/3 ownership in the mall (along with its 1/3 ownership of Arrowhead Towne Center in Glendale), with Westcor assuming full ownership.\n\nThe anchors at the mall are Dillard's, JCPenney, and Macy's\n\nThe Macy's location was to be Broadway Southwest (the last store built by then owner Carter Hawley Hale). This location was halted during a hostile take over attempt by the Limited and sold off to Robinsons-May.\n\nIn 2010, the former Mervyn's became a furniture store called Home Sleep Home, which went out of business.

The game was held on July 10, 2007, at AT&T Park, the home of the NL's San Francisco Giants. It marked the third time that the Giants hosted the All Star Game since moving to San Francisco for the 1958 season. The 1961 and 1984 All Star Games were played at the Giants former home Candlestick Park, and the fourth overall in the Bay Area, with the Giants bay area rivals the Oakland Athletics hosting once back in 1987, and the second straight held in an NL ballpark.\n\nThe American League defeated the National League by a score of 5–4. Ichiro Suzuki won the MVP award for the game for hitting the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star history. As per the 2006 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the American League champion (which eventually came to be the Boston Red Sox) received home field advantage in the 2007 World Series. The victory was the 10th consecutive (excluding the 2002 tie) for the AL, and their 11-game unbeaten streak is only beaten by the NL's 11-game winning streak from 1972 to 1982 in All-Star history.\n\nAs with each All-Star Game since 1970, the eight starting position players (with no designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, and a second fan balloting to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32 players were selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons.\n\nThe Giants were awarded the game on February 9, 2005. The game marked the first time since 1962 that one league hosted consecutive All-Star Games, after Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, hosted the game in 2006.\n\nThe game was the fifth straight All-Star Game to decide home-field advantage in the World Series. The AL entered the game on a ten-game unbeaten streak (nine wins, with one tie in 2002). The NL was looking for their first win since the 1996 game in Philadelphia.\n\nBalloting for the 2007 All-Star Game starters (excluding pitchers) began on April 27 and continued through June 28. The top vote-getters at each position and the top three among outfielders are named the starters for their respective leagues. The results were announced on July 1. About 18.5 million votes were cast by close to twelve million fans. Alex Rodriguez was the leading vote-getter with 3,890,515 votes, easily outpacing his Yankees teammate Derek Jeter by over 700,000 votes. Ken Griffey, Jr., was the top vote-getter in the National League, with 2,986,818 votes.\n\nAfter the rosters were announced, a second round of fan voting, the Monster All-Star Final Vote, was commenced to determine the occupant of the final roster spot for each team. This round lasted until July 5. Chris Young and Hideki Okajima were elected to represent the National League and American League, respectively, in the All-Star Game as first time All-Stars. All ten players included in the balloting were pitchers, a first for the event.\n\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nThese players did not see action in the game.<br>\nVoted onto the roster through the All-Star Final Vote.<br>\nUnable to play due to injury. Brandon Webb took his roster spot.<br>\nUnable to play due to injury. Roy Oswalt took his roster spot.\n\nNational League: \"Tony La Russa\"\nAmerican League: Jim Leyland\n\n\"O Canada\" was played by members of the San Francisco Symphony. \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was sung by Chris Isaak. Before the game, there was a tribute to former San Francisco Giants slugger Willie Mays. Mays threw the ceremonial first pitch to New York Mets shortstop José Reyes. Paula Cole sang \"God Bless America\" during the seventh-inning stretch. The first pitch was thrown by the National League's starter, Jake Peavy at 8:54 EDT The game was completed in 3 hours, 6 minutes under an overcast sky and a gametime temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nUmpires for the game were announced on June 14. Bruce Froemming, the most tenured current umpire in Major League Baseball, was named crew chief for the game. It was also revealed that day that Froemming would retire following the 2007 season.\n\nThe National League got things started in the bottom of the first when José Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter Dan Haren and proceeded to steal second. He scored on an RBI single by Ken Griffey, Jr. to give the NL a 1–0 lead. Barry Bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for in the bottom of the third when, with Reyes on second, he lofted a high fly ball to left field, but it was snared at the warning track by Magglio Ordóñez. The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when Alex Rodriguez attempted to score on a two-out single by Iván Rodríguez. However, the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed Russell Martin to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning. The AL would score one inning later when, after Chris Young issued a leadoff walk to Brian Roberts, Ichiro Suzuki hit a long fly ball off the right field wall. Instead of caroming straight to Griffey, the ball took an unusual bounce off a sign and ricocheted to Griffey's right. This allowed Ichiro to score on what is still the only inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history. The homer gave the AL a 2–1 lead and resulted in Ichiro's MVP win.\n\nThe lead would be augmented in the sixth when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back in the bottom of the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.\n\nThe American League's closers then entered the game, with Jonathan Papelbon pitching a scoreless bottom of the eighth. In the ninth, J. J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep in the hole to Brian Roberts, but he could not come up with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.\n\nThe State Farm Home Run Derby was held the night before the All-Star Game, July 9, and broadcast on ESPN. Four players from each league competed to hit as many home runs as they could in each round to advance and eventually win the contest. This year, a five-swing swing-off would be used to break ties occurring in any round. This became necessary when Albert Pujols and Justin Morneau tied for fourth in the first round. The champion of last year's Derby, Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies, competed even though he was not named to the NL All-Star roster.\n\nIn the finals, Vladimir Guerrero of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim defeated Alex Ríos of the Toronto Blue Jays by a score of 3–2. Guerrero hit 17 home runs in all, second only to Ríos' 19. Guerrero also hit the longest blast of the competition, a drive to left field that just missed hitting a giant replica glove and baseball set up on the concourse beyond the left field bleachers.\n\nAT&T Park is distinguished by having the San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers. The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove, named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey. McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there. Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby, no home runs were actually hit into the water, either on the fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats, though, one foul ball hit by Prince Fielder did reach the water. This was largely due to the three left-handed competitors all exiting in the first round, as well as wind currents blowing toward left field. Prior to the All-Star break, a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the park's history.\n\nGold balls were utilized whenever any player had one out remaining during his round. Any home runs hit with the balls meant Major League Baseball and State Farm would pledge to donate money to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Due to the change in sponsors from Century 21 to State Farm, each ball's value was reduced to US$17,000 to reflect the 17,000 State Farm agents in the United States and Canada. In all, twelve gold ball home runs were hit, which, along with a $50,000 \"bonus\" constituted $254,000 raised for charity.\n\nRecorded only seven of ten outs before hitting winning home run.<br>\nAdvanced after defeating Morneau 2–1 in a swing-off.\n\nThe 2007 XM All-Star Futures Game took place on July 8, showcasing the top minor league prospects from all thirty teams' farm systems. The contest is seven innings regardless of the score with pitchers limited to no more than one inning of work. The World team defeated the United States by a score of 7–2. Chin-Lung Hu of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization won the Larry Doby MVP award after driving in two runs on a single and double, plus a stolen base and a run.\n\n", "id": "7701000", "categories": ["2007 in San Francisco", "Sports competitions in California", "2007 Major League Baseball season", "Sports competitions in San Francisco", "2007 in sports in California", "Baseball in San Francisco", "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"], "title": "2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}

It is situated on the north-east coast about north of Stonehaven in the former county of Kincardineshire. \n\nBronze Age cists have been found at the site of the Ury House. Roman legions marched from Raedykes to Normandykes Roman Camp nearby as they used higher ground evading the bogs of Red Moss and low-lying mosses associated with the Burn of Muchalls. That march used the Elsick Mounth, one of the ancient trackways crossing the Mounth of the Grampian Mountains, lying west of Netherley.\n\nOriginally the estate belonged to the Frasers, then the Hays starting in 1413, but eventually became the property of the Earl Marischal. \n\nColonel David Barclay purchased Urie in a lengthy process in the late 1660s and his descendants owned it through 1854 when the estate was purchased by the Baird family.(source Clan Barclay and newspaper archives Stonehaven). The second laird was his son, Robert Barclay the Quaker apologist. It descended to Robert Barclay Allardice (MP) (1732-1797) and then to his son Captain Barclay, the celebrated pedestrian.\n\nOver the years Ury has been rebuilt three times. \n\nIn early times the property was known as Urie. In the 17th century Ury was established as the North East Scotland headquarters of the Quaker organisation by David Barclay.\n\nToday the house is derelict and the dangerous condition of the structure limits entry. In March 2007, FM Developments lodged an amended planning application for a golf and leisure complex on the estate as the previous housing development was rejected in October 2006. There have been earlier proposals for its restoration, including a 2004 planning application, which was rejected by the local Community Council. \n\nThe estate in now owned by The FM Group who have recently lodged a planning application to Aberdeenshire Council for the creation of a world-class 18-hole Jack Nicklaus Signature Championship Golf Course as part of the redevelopment of Ury Estate.

Nowadays, Ciudad Vieja is a \"barrio\" (neighbourhood or district) of this city. In the last couple of years it has gone through a major transformation that has made it the main nightlife centre in town. It is in this area where most of the nightclubs are, and also it hosts the 'Mercado del Puerto' a traditional venue for Uruguayan food and beverages. The main port of Uruguay (being the main Big Draft port in southern South America) is located in Ciudad Vieja.\n\nPart of this transformation is due to the campaign made by the mayor since this part of the city had been in a state of abandonment for decades.\n\nUntil 1829 it was surrounded by a wall that protected it from possible invasions. After the wall was torn down, the only part of it that was kept was its gateway, which is up to this day an emblem of this part of town. Some streets recall the presence of the wall, like Ciudadela (\"citadel\") or Brecha (\"breach\"), which has this name because it was near but at this point that the British managed to open a breach on the wall during the 1807 British invasion. The old street Sarandí was turned into a pedestrian walkway in 1992, which increased its commercial and tourist attractiveness. In 2005 it was extended to beyond the Constitution Square.\n\nCiudad Vieja has the most beautiful buildings from the colonial era and the first decades of independence. The Cabildo (built between 1804 and 1812), the Solís Theatre, the Metropolitan Cathedral and several museums, like the Museo Torres García are among the most impressive ones. Also several design shops and recycled loft floors flourish in the streets near the port.\n\nSeveral temples have been built in the historic heart of the city:\n\nThe National Meat Institute (INAC), a government agency, has its headquarters here.\n\n\n", "id": "7701029", "categories": ["Ciudad Vieja, Montevideo", "Barrios of Montevideo"], "title": "Ciudad Vieja, Montevideo"}

The assemblies, concentrated in the Montreal and Montérégie region, saw votes on resolutions and speeches of some of Lower Canada's most reputed orators.\n\nThe resolutions and the speeches often protested against the Russell Resolutions and what the Patriotes saw as the injustice of the colonial government that imposed its will by force and without the direct democratic participation of the people. A number of occasions honored Patriote leader Louis-Joseph Papineau. The text of the resolutions were often prepared by members of a permanent central committee in Montreal. Speeches also appealed to either economic boycotts of British products or to an armed uprising. Papineau believed in the former while Wolfred Nelson became a proponent of the latter.\n\nOften, allusions were also made to the great liberty of the United States of America and the possible support for Lower Canada that could arise in the neighbouring republic. The American Revolution was indeed a major influence of the Patriote movement and its rebellion. Ultimately, the United States would be of little help to the coming Lower Canada Rebellion, despite plans by American northeastern citizens to provide weapons and the passive role that country played hosting the Frères chasseurs and the hunted and banished Patriotes (notably Papineau). They eventually proclaimed their neutrality and, in January 1838, American President Martin Van Buren even cautioned Americans against any assistance or protection, declaring that anyone who would compromise the neutrality of the United States would expose themselves to arrestation and punishment.\n\n", "id": "7701049", "categories": ["Lower Canada Rebellion", "1837 conferences", "1837 in Canada"], "title": "Patriote popular assemblies"}

The 607 WS commander is also the Joint METOC Officer (JMO) and the senior US METOC officer (SMO) for the Korean Theater of Operations (KTO).\n\nFollowing the conclusion of World War II, Korean weather support was managed by the 20th Weather Squadron, headquartered in Japan. The lone Air Force weather detachment in Korea was closed in September 1949.\n\nMobile units of the 20th returned to Korea the next year at the start of the Korean War. The 30th Weather Squadron was soon reactivated with its headquarters in Korea to support the Fifth Air Force and other United Nations Forces. Within one month, the unit's headquarters were forced to retreat south from Seoul to Taegu. It remained in Taegu until July 1951, when it returned to Seoul. In 1954, the headquarters moved to Osan Air Base.\n\nAfter the end of the Korean War, the 30th Weather Squadron began to turn over several of its locations to the Republic of Korea (ROK) Air Force. In 1957, headquarters of the 30th moved from Korea to Japan, to oversee the weather detachments in Korea and Japan with the inactivation of the 20th Weather Squadron. In 1957, the 30th was assigned to the 10th Weather Group. In 1959, the 30th was inactivated and its detachments assigned directly to the 10th Weather Group. The 10th Weather Group was inactivated in 1960.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1964, the remaining USAF weather units in Korea reported directly to the First Weather Wing located at Hickam AFB, Hawaii. In 1964, the 20th Weather Squadron was reactivated at Fuchu Air Station, Japan, and again took responsibility for managing the USAF weather units in Korea. In 1974, 20th Weather Squadron headquarters moved to Yokota AB, Japan, and continued to manage USAF weather support in Korea until it was inactivated on 1 September 1976.\n\nOn that date, the 30th Weather Squadron was reactivated at Yongsan Army Garrison, Seoul, and all USAF weather units on the Korean peninsula were placed under the squadron's control. The 30th Weather Squadron managed all US weather support in Korea until 1992.\n\nIn 1992, the US Air Force reorganized, placing all support assets under the control of the local Wing Commander. The 30th Weather Squadron was again inactivated, the squadron at Yongsan was redesignated as the 51st Weather Squadron, and weather units at Osan and Kunsan were removed from squadron control and placed under the local USAF Wing Commanders at their respective bases. The 51st Weather Squadron continued to manage weather support to the Commander, United Nations Command, the Commander, Combined Forces Command, the Commander, United States Forces Korea (CDR, USFK), the Commander, Eighth Army (CDR, 8A), and to all US Army units on the peninsula.\n\nBecause the 51st Weather Squadron was not under the operational control of the 51st Fighter Wing at Osan AB, the decision was made in July 1993 to replace it with the reactivated 5th Weather Squadron, which had a long lineage of battle decorations from the Pacific Theater in World War II and the Vietnam War.\n\nAnother USAF restructuring of Numbered Air Forces and a drive toward standardized naming conventions caused the Air Force to inactivate the 5th Weather Squadron and to activate the 607th Weather Squadron in December 1994. Today, the 607th Weather Squadron is part of the 607th Air Support Operations Group, 7th Air Force, Pacific Air Forces.\n\nIn 1999, the 607th Weather Squadron became the USAF's second \"Weather Hub\". In this capacity, the squadron was responsible for providing all point and area weather forecasts for US Forces Command forces operating on the Korean Peninsula. The Weather Hub portion of the 607th was decommissioned and moved to Japan in 2003.\n\nToday, the 607th Weather Squadron has 62 personnel assigned at four locations throughout the Republic of Korea including USAG-Yongsan, Seoul; K-16 Air Base, Seoul AB East; USAG-Red Cloud, Uijongbu; and USAG-Humphreys, Pyongtaek.\n\n\nThe 607 WS is functionally organized to provide weather support to Headquarters, United Nations Command/US Forces Korea (UNC/USFK) and subordinate Air, Ground, Naval, Marine and Special Operations Component Commands.\n\nIn-theater units provide weather support at 15 locations in the ROK. Five locations support the U.S. Army's 2 Combat Aviation Brigade and 2nd Infantry Division (United States) and three units support combined/joint operations during exercises and contingencies. These units would be augmented by weather forces attached to and supporting inbound combat units in contingencies/war.\n\nThe 607 WS at (United States Army Garrison) USAG-Yongsan, Seoul is divided into two main functional areas: staff support, and the weather team for Seoul AB East at K-16. The 607 WS provides weather forecast products for Korea and the adjacent waters. The staff form the nucleus of the Combined Meteorological Forecast Unit (CMFU) during exercises/contingencies. Forecasters assigned to the staff also prepare weather forecasts for American Forces Korean Network (AFKN). USAG Humphreys is the regional briefing station for the Korean Theater of Operations. The 607WS staff areas of expertise include operations, forecasting, observing, plans, communications, mobility/readiness, security, scientific services, administration, training and logistics.\n\nDetachment 1 (Det 1), 607 WS is based at USAG Camp Red Cloud, in Uijeongbu, north of Seoul. The detachment's mission is to provide weather support to the Headquarters Staff, 2nd Infantry Division (2ID).\n\nThe 607 WS staff provides direct support to the UNC/USFK and Eighth Army (8A). They maintain liaison with US Navy weather support activities and also coordinate weather support with the ROKAF Weather Wing (WW) of the ROK Air Force and ROK Navy. The combat weather teams provide briefings, observations, and staff weather support, including limited observing support at H-264 helipad.\n\n\n", "id": "7701053", "categories": ["Weather squadrons of the United States Air Force"], "title": "607th Weather Squadron"}

At the age of 16, Henry went to study law at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge and continued at Gray's Inn, London. Upon his father's death in 1614, he went to France to join his brother William, who was at Douai studying to be a priest. Morse converted to Roman Catholicism at The English College, Douay. He returned to England to settle some financial arrangements and was arrested at Dover for refusing to take the Oath of allegiance and confined to Southwark goal.\n\nMorse remained incarcerated with a number of priests for four years, until King James I of England ordered amnesty and banishment for about 100 priests, in furtherance of negotiations to arrange a Spanish marriage for his son Prince Charles. He arrived back at Douai in August 1618 and was sent to the English College in Rome to commence his studies. While there, he used the alias \"Henry Claxon\" to shield his identity from the Crown's spies. \n\nHe was ordained at Rome and left for the English Mission on 19 June 1624. Morse was assigned to assist the Jesuits at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where later that year there was an outbreak of plague. Morse and his companions nursed the sick. The following year he was arrested and later moved from Newcastle gaol to York Castle where he again tended the sick. He completed his novitiate under his fellow prisoner, Father John Robinson, and took simple vows as a Jesuit. After three years in prison he was banished from the country and served as a missionary to the English and Irish soldiers attached to the Spanish army in the Low Countries.\n\nReturning to England at the end of 1633 he laboured in London, in the St Giles-in-the-Fields area. In 1635 plague was brought on boats from Flanders. Morse himself contracted the illness while nursing the sick, but recovered. Here he worked with John Southworth, raising funds for food and medicine. Arrested 27 February 1636, he was imprisoned in Newgate. On 22 April he was brought to the bar charged with being a priest and having withdrawn the king's subjects from their faith and allegiance. He was found guilty on the first count, not guilty on the second, and sentence was deferred. On 23 April he made his solemn profession of the three vows to Father Edward Lusher. He was released on bail for 10,000 florins, 20 June 1637, at the insistence of Queen Henriette Maria. In order to free his sureties he voluntarily went into exile when the royal proclamation was issued ordering all priests to leave the country before 7 April 1641, and became chaplain to Gage's English regiment in the service of Spain.\n\nIn 1643 he returned to England; arrested after about a year and a half he was imprisoned at Durham and Newcastle, and sent by sea to London. On 30 January he was again brought to the bar and condemned on his previous conviction. On 1 February 1645 his hurdle was drawn by four horses and the French ambassador attended with all his suite, as also did Lois, Count of Egmont, and the Portuguese Ambassador. Morse was allowed to hang until he was dead. At the quartering the footmen of the French Ambassador and of the Count of Egmont dipped their handkerchiefs into the martyr's blood.\n\nVenerated from 8 December 1929, and beatified on 15 December 1929, he was named one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales in 1970.\n\nIn 2012, a Catholic church dedicated to St. Henry Morse was built on Shelfanger Road in Diss, replacing the church of the Most Holy Trinity.\n\n\n", "id": "7701090", "categories": ["17th-century English Jesuits", "People executed by Stuart England by hanging, drawing and quartering", "Jesuit saints", "17th-century English Roman Catholic priests", "Forty Martyrs of England and Wales", "Executed people from Suffolk", "1645 deaths", "English saints", "1595 births", "Jesuit martyrs", "English Roman Catholic saints", "Converts to Roman Catholicism", "17th-century Christian saints", "17th-century Roman Catholic martyrs", "16th-century English Roman Catholic priests"], "title": "Henry Morse"}

He was warned in January 2006 that failure to surrender to authorities would result in his house being burnt down again.\n\nHe is third in command of the Pakistani Taliban umbrella group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), formed in December 2007 under the leadership of Baitullah Mehsud and prefers the title Commander Faqir.\n\nOn February 23, 2009 Faqir Mohammed declared in a 30-minute radio broadcast that his followers would begin a unilateral ceasefire. The speech came only a few hours after the Pakistani military announced a halt to operations in the nearby Swat valley, where it had been battling the Swati division of the TTP under the leadership of Maulana Fazlullah.\n\nAfter Baituallah Mehsud's reported death in August 2009, Maulana Faqir Mohammed announced to the BBC that he would assume temporary leadership of the TTP and that Muslim Khan would serve as primary spokesperson. He also maintained that Baitullah had not been killed but rather was in ill health. Faqir further elaborated that decisions over leadership of the umbrella group would only be made in consultation and consensus with other TTP leaders. \"The congregation of Taliban leaders has 32 members and no important decision can be taken without their consultation,\" he told the BBC. He reported to the AFP that both Hakimullah Mehsud and Wali-ur-Rehman had approved his appointment as temporary leader of the militant group. Neither militant had publicly confirmed Faqir's statement, and analysts cited by Dawn News believed the assumption of leadership actually indicated a power struggle.\n\nTwo days later Faqir Mohammed retracted his claims of temporary leadership and said that Hakimullah Mehsud had been selected leader of the TTP.\n\nAfter the alleged death of Hakimullah Mehsud in mid-January, 2010, Faqir Mohammed was one of the highest level leaders. Malik Noor Jamal alias \"Maulana Toofan\" was reported to have been appointed as head of the TTP after Mehsud's death but his leadership may not have been entirely accepted as there were also reports of deadly clashes between Toofan's men and those of a TTP leader in Kurram. Pakistan launched an air attack on a building where it was thought that Faqir Mohammed was having a meeting with Taliban figures Fateh Mohammad and Qari Ziaur Rehman. Fateh Mohammed was quickly confirmed as dead but the death of the other two was not known immediately. Within days, Faqir Mohammed gave a telephone interview and claimed that he was not present at the attack and that all senior officials had survived.\n\nFaqir Mohammed launched attacks on Pakistani border posts from Afghanistan's eastern Kunar province, across the border with Pakistan's Bajaur Agency, and was hosted by Qari Zia-ur-Rahman. Mohammed claimed responsibility for a 4 July 2011, attack on a paramilitary checkpoint and for similar attacks in June 2011 on several border villages in Bajaur. During a radio broadcast Mohammed stated, \"Our fighters carried out these two attacks from Afghanistan, and we will launch more such attacks inside Afghanistan and in Pakistan.\"\n\nIn early March 2012 the TTP announced that Faqir had been demoted from his role as \"naib amir\" and would be \"considered a common fighter.\" The main TTP spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, reported that Faqir Mohammed had been conducting peace talks with the Pakistani government without the approval of TTP leadership.\n\nOn 18 February 2013 Maulvi Faqir was arrested along with his four accomplices by Afghan Intelligence Officials while he was trying to enter Pakistan’s Tirah Valley from Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province.\n\n", "id": "7701215", "categories": ["Taliban leaders", "1970s births", "Living people", "Pashtun people", "Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan members", "Year of birth uncertain"], "title": "Faqir Mohammed"}

It was built between 1974 and 1976 by Baranya County State Construction Industry Company (\"Baranya Megyei Állami Építőipari Vállalat\"). When it was inhabited, it had 800 residences. In 1989, however, it was determined that the building's inner structure was deteriorating to a dangerous extent. The building was evacuated. There have been some plans to renovate and use the building for various purposes, but none of these were ever realized. By 2003 the building had fallen into a critical condition, so it was reinforced, but it remained out of use. It was the tallest out-of-use building in Central Europe until its deconstruction in 2016.\n\nThe reinforced concrete structure of Magasház was built using Yugoslavian IMS post tensioning technology.\n\nThis technology was used to create residential and public buildings in Hungary since the early 1970s. The idea behind IMS was constructing premade floor slabs and columns, connecting them afterwards. The gaps between elements were filled with a sealant called \"PU paste\". This filling material however, was known to cause chloride corrosion over time, damaging the beams and in Yugoslavia, they used an inhibitor material and also separated the paste from the tensioned posts with a 1mm thin plastic sheet but in Hungary, they skipped these despite only a very small amount of inhibitor would've been necessary. Because of this, the building became unstable, and the inhabitants had to move out by the year 1989.\n\nIn 2003 the local government paid 360 million Hungarian Forints for structural repairs. The building was sold for an Austrian company, the Porr Hungária Kft, to make it a dormitory for the University of Pécs in the PPP program. The company stepped back from the agreement in 2007.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, the city made an unsuccessful tender to convert the building into an office for the local government. Magasház was sold again in 2008 to the La Torre 2008 Kft, that accumulated significant debt over the years since.\n\nNo progress has been made in the utilization of the building until 2011, when the idea of selling Magasház to the company Öresund Holding incurred, so that it would be demolished, and a municipal building would be constructed in its place, that would be rented by the city for 30 years.\n\nOn 25 April 2013 the Second Cabinet of Viktor Orbán held a session in Pécs. Here, Viktor Orbán made a promise to mayor Zsolt Páva, that the government will give one billion Hungarian forints for the demolition of Magasház, if the city acquires the ownership of the building.\n\nOn 4 October 2013 the La Torre 2008 Kft. was acquired by a citizen of Pécs, the 76 years old pensioner Hosszú Zoltán Dénesné. The court of Komárom-Esztergom ordered the liquidation of the company on 16 October.\n\nOn 22 October 2013 the declaration of demolition for the building was issued, giving a six-month deadline for the owner.\n\nFinally in March 2016 the demolishing started and the last walls of the building disappeared in October 2016.\n\n\n", "id": "7701219", "categories": ["Skyscrapers in Hungary", "Buildings and structures in Pécs"], "title": "High-rise of Pécs"}

This was an increase on 3,028 inhabitants and 1,228 households in the 2001 UK census. \nThe town continues to grow in size, due to the expanding Ben Bailey housing estate.\n\nSnaith is the focal point of the local rural area. It has primary and secondary schools. The town exit and entry to the M62 is approximately away, giving access to Hull, Doncaster, Goole, Leeds and Castleford. It is approximately from York. Selby is away, with Carlton and Camblesforth between.\n\nSnaith was part of the Goole Rural District in the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1894 to 1974, then in Boothferry district of Humberside until 1996.\n\nThe name \"Snaith\" derives from the Old Scandinavian word \"sneith\", meaning \"Piece of land cut off\". Snaith was recorded in its modern-day form in c.1080, however in the \"Domesday Book\" of 1086, it was recorded as \"Esneid\".\n\nThe priory church of St Lawrence is low and wide, with pinnacles. The core of the church is Norman and Cruciform, and the tower is Early English and stands at the west end. The chancel is Decorated and the nave has Perpendicular arcades and a high clerestory. Glass in the chancel window is by Francis Spear and there is a notable monument to Viscount Downe by Francis Chantrey.\nThe church was designated a Grade I listed building in 1967 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England.\n\nSnaith has a library, post office, dental practice, doctor's surgery, pharmacy, opticians and petrol station. There is also a Co-operative store, and a variety of small retail, service and food outlets, including takeaways. The town has five public houses. It also has a notable small brewery, The Old Mill Brewery, established in 1983 in a mill building dating back to 1791.\n\nSchools in the town include Snaith Primary School and The Snaith School (secondary).\n\nSnaith railway station is situated on the line approximately halfway between Hull and Leeds. It is served by a railway station, with a limited service on the Pontefract Line from Leeds to Goole.\n\nThe town also has a regular bus service, and is central to the 400 and 401 Arriva bus services, which usually commute hourly between Selby and Goole.\n\nSnaith Juniors Football Club was formed in 1990 as Croda F.C. because the football pitch was in the grounds of Cowick Hall, then used by Croda International. Snaith Juniors F.C. now play at Ben Bailey housing estate and hold football tournaments at the end of May each year. The council proposed making a cricket pitch for a town cricket team, but no land was available. The Garth, adjacent to the Methodist Chapel, was given to the people of Snaith for recreation and leisure.\n\n", "id": "7701222", "categories": [], "title": "Snaith"}

Total holding are over 176,000 volumes with over 500 periodical subscriptions.\n\nIn 1884, Leonard Porter willed the sum of $1,000 to the establishment of a public library in Dover Township, Ohio (which became Westlake Township in 1940, and the City of Westlake in 1957) and a collection of books to be housed within. Circulation records date back to 1893, when the average circulation per week was 24.083 books, or about 1,252 books per year. As Dover Township grew, so did its library. The town passed a tax revenue agreement in support of library funds in 1897.\n\nPorter Library sponsored debates, meetings and social functions in the 1900s. An Ice Cream Saloon was held on alternate Saturdays. The library extended its collection and services to the Dover Township schools in 1920. In 1933 the permanent legislation enacted by the Ohio State Legislature allocated proceeds from personal property tax to the boards of library trustees. Porter Library received $3,096.\n\nAudrey Ward served as library director from 1939-1960. The 1940s saw continued development of the library. The building was remodeled, hours of service increased, and the book budget improved. The library moved to new quarters in 1950: the Ohio Bell Telephone Company building at 27509 Center Ridge Road. By 1957, the library trustees realized that with the growth of the population of the community (an amazing rate of one family per day), Porter Library needed room to expand.\n\nIn July 1958 the library celebrated a groundbreaking for a new addition. The new wing opened on February 1, 1960.

Porter Library staff developed pre-school and school age children’s programming, such as story hours. They acquired a young adult collection, and extended library services to parochial schools. They supported adult programs, and organized a pamphlet and picture file, a periodical collection, and a film, filmstrip and phonograph collection.\n\nIn 1981 the library acquired a special mascot. A one-eyed gray and black tabby cat named Jiggers moved with the library when the building took permanent residence at 27333 Center Ridge Road in 1985.\n\nWestlake Porter Public Library's catalog became an online version in 1986. The library provided patrons with computers and the classes to learn how to use them. On October 12, 1992 Paula Miller, library director, joined the staff and shared her vision of the future. In the early 1990s the library took on the role of community center for advanced telecommunications and multimedia/electronic access. Collections also changed to include multimedia such as CDs, videos, and later DVDs. Online reference services became available.

Outside football he worked as a brewery representative.\n\nHe became a Football League linesman in 1957, stepping up to referee in 1959. He refereed the Amateur Cup final of that year. Finney then took charge of the 1962 FA Cup Final between Tottenham Hotspur and Burnley. Though the normal practice at the time was for the winning captain to keep the match ball, Danny Blanchflower presented Finney with the ball at the end of the game. He is reported to be one of five freemasons to have refereed the FA Cup Final.\n\nFinney had been held in high regard within the domestic game for some time before this match.

The initial service was between Annapolis, Maryland, on the western shore and Claiborne, Maryland, on the eastern shore. In July 1930, a second shorter route was added between Annapolis, Maryland, and Matapeake on Kent Island, Maryland. Business increased so rapidly at that point that another ferryboat was added. In May, 1938 the Claiborne route was changed to run from Claiborne to Romancoke, Maryland, on the lower end of Kent Island, from which passengers could then connect to the Matapeake to Annapolis run. In 1943, the Annapolis United States Naval Academy absorbed the property where the ferry terminal had been, so service was switched from Annapolis to a new terminal at Sandy Point on the western shore. By May 1951, the ferries were handling 1 million vehicles and 2 million passengers annually. Ferry service stopped running in 1952 when the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was completed.\n\nThe first Claiborne-Annapolis run was June 19, 1919, with the sidewheeler \"Gov.\" \"Emerson C. Harrington\", named for the 48th Governor of Maryland and later President of the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company. As governor, Harrington had been instrumental in getting the ferry started. In 1915, the State Roads Commission had appropriated $50,000 to establish a state-owned ferry. With the beginning of World War I, planning was put on hold until 1919. At that time a group of businessmen headed by J. P. Mehaham, of St. Louis, and Frank McNamee, of Albany, and at the urging of Gov. Harrington, formed a private company named the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry, Inc. The state funds were instead diverted toward subsidizing the new private company. The \"Old Harrington\", as the boat became known, made two round trips daily, crossing the Chesapeake Bay in 1 hour 20 minutes.\n\nIn 1921, the company was in bankruptcy, but Gov. Harrington, his term as Governor over, became President of the company and instituted reforms to make it more profitable. Not until 1924 did the company begin to see receipts exceed expenses. In 1921, a bus route was added to carry passengers to Easton, Hurlock, and Cambridge. In 1928 the company was reorganized and renamed the Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Company.\n\nThe \"Gov. Emerson C. Harrington\" was retired in 1937 and replaced by the \"Gov.\" \"Harry W. Nice\", a double-ender which could hold up to 68 cars. Other boats were to include the \"General Lincoln\", \"Majestic\", \"Albert C. Ritchie\", \"John M. Dennis\", \"Gov. Harry W. Nice\", \"Gov. Emerson C. Harrington II\", \"Governor Herbert R. O'Conor\", and the \"B. Frank Sherman\", the last named for the company's General Manager from 1924-1952.\n\nSerious discussion about building a bridge across the Chesapeake Bay had been around since at least 1907, but did not take hold until the 1930s. Since the bridge would put the ferry out of business, the State decided it had an obligation to the ferry owners to purchase the company. In 1941, the company was purchased for $1,023,000 by the Maryland State Roads Commission (now the Maryland State Highway Administration), and was renamed the Chesapeake Bay Ferry System.\n\nAt the time the company was purchased by the State Roads Commission, it had approximately 120 employees.\n\nService on the ferry was continued across the Chesapeake Bay until July 30, 1952, the same day the new Chesapeake Bay Bridge was opened. During a final run by the \"John M. Dennis\" a few weeks before the bridge opening, it \"accidentally\" rammed the new bridge [Variations on the cause of the \"accident\" can be found between newspaper accounts and recollections by family members of the ship's Captain Edward C. Higgins]. The last run from Claiborne to Romancoke was on December 31, 1952, by the \"Gov. Emerson C. Harrington II\".\n\nOther miscellaneous photographs\n\n", "id": "7701324", "categories": [], "title": "Claiborne–Annapolis Ferry Company"}

Depending on the sport, when a player commits certain types of penalties, the opposition is awarded a penalty shot or kick attempt. The rules on how a player attempts a penalty shot or kick also varies between sports.\n\nPenalty shots or kicks are sometimes grouped into the larger penalty shootout, which is used as a tiebreaker to decide games in several sports.\n\nIn association football, a penalty kick is awarded to the opponent when a direct free kick foul has been committed by a team within its own penalty area. The shot is taken from the penalty mark, which is from the goal line and centred between the touch line, while the goal is defended only by the opposing team's goalkeeper. If the match is tied after 90min of regulation and 30min of extra time, a penalty shootout is used to determine the winner. Penalties are taken from the spot, but no rebounds are allowed.\n\nA penalty shot is awarded to the fouled team in bandy, following a foul usually punishable by a free-shot but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.\n\nThe situations when a penalty shot is to be made is stated in Rule 14 of the Bandy Playing Rules published by the Federation of International Bandy. The execution of a penalty shot is regulated in Rule 15.\n\nIf a match is at a draw at full time, a penalty shot competition can be arranged in order to determine a winning team, either after an extension of the match which still is at a draw or instead of an extension. This is regulated in Rule 16.\n\nIn Gaelic football, a penalty kick may be awarded if a defender commits a foul within the large rectangle enclosing the goal. The penalty kick is taken from the ground from the centre of the 11m line. Only the goalkeeper may guard the goals.\n\nIn ice hockey, a penalty shot is awarded to a player in a good shooting position denied a chance at a goal by the foul of an opponent. All players are required to leave the ice rink as the player who got fouled faces off solely against the goaltender of the opposite team. The puck is placed at the center of the ice rink as the player has twenty seconds to retrieve the puck and attempt to score a goal against the goaltender. The penalty shot ends as soon as the puck either crosses the goal line, is blocked by the goaltender, stops moving, moves in the opposite direction of the goal line, or if the shooter loses possession of the puck.\n\nPenalty shots are awarded.\n\nIf a side commits a penalty infringement the opposition can take the option of a place kick at goal from where the infringement occurred. A successful penalty kick is worth two points in rugby league and three points in rugby union.\n\nA penalty shot or \"throw\" is awarded when a defender commits a major foul within the five meter area that prevents a likely goal.\n\nIn field hockey, a penalty stroke or a penalty corner is awarded after a foul.\n\nFree throws are the equivalent of the penalty shot in basketball; free throws are much more common than penalty shots in other sports, due to the much higher rate of scoring in that game.\n\nGridiron football does not have any sort of explicit equivalent to the penalty shot; scenarios where an illegal act deprived someone of a score are handled through the unfair act clause, which allows officials the right to assess any penalty they see fit, including awarding the score automatically.\n", "id": "7701404", "categories": ["Bandy rules", "Terminology used in multiple sports"], "title": "Penalty shot"}

It is owned by Spokane City-County.\n\nThe airport has two hard surface runways. Felts Field is used for general aviation now, but it was Spokane's airline airport before the opening of Spokane International Airport.\n\nIt is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a regional reliver facility.\n\nFelts Field, Spokane's historic airfield, is on the south bank of the Spokane River east of Spokane. Aviation activities began in 1913. In 1920 the field, then called the \"Parkwater airstrip\", was designated a municipal flying field at the instigation of the Spokane Chamber of Commerce. In 1926, the United States Department of Commerce recognized Parkwater as an airport, one of the first in the West. In September 1927, in conjunction with Spokane's National Air Derby and Air Races, the airport was renamed Felts Field for James Buell Felts (1898–1927), a Washington Air National Guard aviator killed in a crash that May. Parkwater Aviation Field, later Felts Field, was the location for flight instruction, charter service, airplane repair, aerial photography, headquarters of the 116th Observation Squadron of the Washington Air National Guard, and eventually the first airmail and commercial flights in and out of Spokane.\n\nAfter World War II, commercial air traffic moved to Geiger Field (later Spokane International Airport). Felts Field remains a busy regional hub for private and small-plane aviation and related businesses and services. In 1991 it was designated Felts Field Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nToday the airport is used for general aviation. No scheduled passenger service remains at Felts, though commercial scheduled Part 135 cargo operations remain via UPS and DHL contracting (Ameriflight LLC and previously Merlin Express Airways).\n\nFelts Field covers at an elevation of 1,957 feet (596 m). It has two runways: 4L/22R is 4,499 by 150 feet (1,371 x 46 m) concrete and 4R/22L is 2,650 by 75 feet (808 x 23 m) asphalt. It has a seaplane landing area designated 3W/21W, 6,000 by 100 feet (1,829 x 30 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending February 28, 2015, the airport had 54,881 aircraft operations, average 150 per day: 93% general aviation, 7% air taxi, and <1% military. In July 2017, 176 aircraft were based at this airport: 146 single-engine, 15 multi-engine, and 15 helicopters.\n\nOn November 29, 2003 an Ameriflight LLC cargo (Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner) (N439AF) crashed on approach to runway 22R at Felts Field using ILS. The pilot's HSI was previously noted as inoperative, deferred, and due for scheduled maintenance. It is unclear whether the pilot was using backup instrumentation as prescribed via the deferral process or using the faulty HSI. The Metro III failed to maintain ILS glide slope and crashed short of the runway into rising terrain and trees. The pilot was killed during the subsequent impact and fire. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.\n\n\n", "id": "7701464", "categories": ["Buildings and structures in Spokane, Washington", "Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces in Washington (state)", "Airports in Washington (state)", "National Register of Historic Places in Spokane, Washington", "Airports established in 1913", "1913 establishments in Washington (state)", "Transportation in Spokane, Washington", "Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington (state)"], "title": "Felts Field"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7701470", "text": "Persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia\n\nThe Persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia, also known as the Genocide of the Serbs ( / \"Genocid nad Srbima\") included the extermination, expulsion and forced religious conversion of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs by the genocidal policies of the Ustashe regime in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) between 1941 and 1945, during World War II. The Ustashe regime systematically murdered approximately 300,000 to 500,000 Serbs out of whom up to 52,000 died at the Jasenovac concentration camp, according to current estimates.\n\nEthnic tensions between Croats and Serbs can be traced back to the Great Schism of 1054. During the time of the Austrian Empire, many Croats came to resent the privileges granted to Serbs living in the Military Frontier of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary in the final days of World War I, the Croat and Slovene-dominated State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was established. Having fought on the side of the Central Powers during the war, ethnic Croats and Slovenes — who formed the majority of the state's population — were viewed unfavourably by western nations and as such they failed to gain recognition from the Great Powers. This left them no choice but to join a union largely dominated by ethnic Serbs, which came to be known as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Upon its creation, the state was composed of six million Serbs, 3.5 million Croats and 1 million Slovenes. Being the largest ethnic group, the Serbs favoured a centralized state, whereas Croats, Slovenes and Bosnian Muslims did not.\n\nApproved on 28 June 1921 and based on the Serbian constitution of 1903, the so-called Vidovdan Constitution established the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as a parliamentary monarchy under the Serbian Karađorđević dynasty. Belgrade was chosen as the capital of the new state, assuring Serb and Orthodox Christian political dominance. In 1928, Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) leader Stjepan Radić was assassinated on the floor of the country's parliament by a Montenegrin Serb leader and People's Radical Party (NRS) politician Puniša Račić. The following year King Alexander I proclaimed the 6 January Dictatorship and renamed his country the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to deemphasize its ethnic makeup. Yugoslavia was divided into nine administrative units called \"banovinas\", six of which had ethnic Serb majorities. In 1931, the king issued a decree which allowed the Yugoslav Parliament to reconvene on the condition that only pro-Yugoslav parties were allowed to be represented in it. Marginalized, far-right and far-left movements thrived. The Ustaše, a Croatian fascist party, emerged as the most extreme movement of these. The Ustaše were driven by a deep hatred of Serbs and Serbdom and claimed that \"Croats and Serbs were separated by an unbridgable cultural gulf\" which prevented them from ever living alongside each other. They organized the so-called Velebit uprising in 1932, assaulting a police station in the village of Brušani in Lika. The police responded harshly to the assault and harassed the local population. In 1934, the Ustaše cooperated with Bulgarian, Hungarian and Italian right-wing extremists to assassinate Alexander while he visited the French city of Marseille. Alexander's cousin, Prince Paul, took the regency until Alexander's son, Peter II, turned eighteen. Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić believed that the assassination would cause Yugoslavia to disintegrate. Instead, countries that had assisted the organization, such as Italy and Hungary, cracked down on its members, arrested them, and destroyed their training camps at Yugoslavia's behest. According to historian Slavko Goldstein, the Ustaše planned to commit a genocide against ethnic Serbs for years prior to the outbreak of World War II. One of Pavelić's main ideologues, Mijo Babić, wrote in 1932:\n\nCroatian opposition to a centralized Yugoslavia continued following Alexander's assassination, culminating with the signing of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement by Croatian politician Vladko Maček and Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković on 26 August 1939. By signing the agreement, Belgrade sought to accommodate moderate Croats through the creation of a largely autonomous Banovina of Croatia which covered 27 percent of Yugoslavia's territory and included 29 percent of its population. It also ensured that Maček became Yugoslavia's deputy premier. Ultimately, the agreement was not successful—it led to other Yugoslav ethnic groups demanding a status similar to that of Croatia and failed to satisfy right-wing Croats such as those that had joined the Ustaše, who wanted a fully independent Croatian state. The Ustaše were enraged by the very notion of Maček having negotiated with Belgrade, denouncing him as a \"sell out\". Right-wing Croats quickly orchestrated anti-Serbian incidents across the newly formed Banovina, and in June 1940, a Croatian National-Socialist Party was established in Zagreb. On 25 March 1941, Yugoslavia bowed to German pressure and signed the Tripartite Pact in an effort to avoid war with the Axis powers. Two days later, a group of Serbian nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers organized a \"coup d'état\" to depose Prince Paul and the government of Dragiša Cvetković. Peter was declared to be of age and was elevated to the throne. Upon hearing news of the coup, Adolf Hitler immediately ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers, and the puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) was created, ruled by the Ustaše regime. The ideology of the Ustaše movement was a blend of Nazism, Catholicism, and Croatian ultranationalism. The Ustaše supported the creation of a Greater Croatia that would span to the Drina river and the outskirts of Belgrade. The movement emphasized the need for a racially \"pure\" Croatia and promoted the extermination of Serbs who were viewed as ethinic foreigners, Jews and Gypsies.\n\nA major ideological influence on the Croatian nationalism of the Ustaše was the 19th-century nationalist Ante Starčević. Starčević was an advocate of Croatian unity and independence and was both anti-Habsburg and anti-Serb. He envisioned the creation of a Greater Croatia that would include territories inhabited by Bosniaks, Serbs, and Slovenes, considering Bosniaks and Serbs to be Croats who had been converted to Islam and Eastern Orthodox Christianity and considering the Slovenes to be \"mountain Croats\".\n\nStarčević argued that the large Serb presence in the territories that were claimed by a Greater Croatia was the result of recent settlement, which had been encouraged by the Habsburg rulers, along with the influx of groups like Vlachs who took up Eastern Orthodox Christianity and identified themselves as Serbs. The Ustaše used Starčević's theories to promote the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia and they recognized Croatia as having two major ethnocultural components: Catholic Croats and Muslim Croats, because the Ustaše saw the Islam of the Bosnian-Muslims as a religion which \"keeps true the blood of Croats.\" Armed struggle, genocide and terrorism were glorified by the group. Alexander Korb wrote:\n\n \nAfter Nazi forces entered into Zagreb on April 10, 1941 Pavelić's closest associate Slavko Kvaternik proclaimed the formation of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) on a Radio Zagreb broadcast. Meanwhile, Pavelić and several hundred Ustaše volunteers left their camps in Italy and travelled to Zagreb, where Pavelić declared a new government on 16 April 1941. He accorded himself the title of \"Poglavnik\" (, ). The Independent State of Croatia was declared to be on Croatian \"ethnic and historical territory\".\n\nThe NDH combined most of modern Croatia, all of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern Serbia into an \"Italian-German quasi-protectorate\". NDH authorities, led by the Ustaše militia, then implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani populations living in the new state. The Ustashe cruelty and sadism shocked even Nazi commanders.\n\nViktor Gutić made several speeches in early summer 1941, calling Serbs \"former enemies\" and \"unwanted elements\" to be cleansed and destroyed, and also threatened Croats who did not support their cause.\n\nIn 1941 the usage of the Cyrillic script was banned, and in June 1941 began the elimination of \"Eastern\" (Serbian) words from the Croatian language, as well as the shutting down of Serbian schools. Ante Pavelić ordered, through the \"Croatian state office for language\", the creation of new words from old roots (some which are used today), and purged many Serbian words.\n\nIn the summer of 1941, Ustashe militias and death squads burnt villages and killed thousands of civilian Serbs in the country-side in sadistic ways with various weapons and tools. Men, women, children were hacked to death, thrown alive into pits and down ravines, or set on fire in churches. Some Serb villages near Srebrenica and Ozren were wholly massacred, while children were found impaled by stakes in villages between Vlasenica and Kladanj.\n\nA large number of massacres were committed by the Ustashe. Some of the more notable ones were:\n\nThe Ustashe set up temporary concentration camps in the spring of 1941 and laid the groundwork for a network of permanent camps in autumn. The creation of concentration camps and extermination campaign of Serbs had been planned by the Ustashe leadership long before 1941. In Ustashe state exhibits in Zagreb, the camps were portrayed as productive and \"peaceful work camps\", with photographs of smiling inmates. Croatia was the only Axis satellite to have erected camps specifically for children.\n\nSerbs, Jews and Romani were arrested and sent to concentration camps such as Jasenovac, Stara Gradiška, Gospić and Jadovno. There were 22–26 camps in NDH in total. Special camps for children were those at Sisak, Gornja Rijeka and Jastrebarsko, while Stara Gradiška held thousands of children and women.\n\nThe largest and most notorious camp was the Jasenovac-Stara Gradiška complex, the largest extermination camp in the Balkans. An estimated 100,000 inmates perished there, most Serbs. Vjekoslav \"Maks\" Luburić, the commander-in-chief of all the Croatian camps, announced the great \"efficiency\" of the Jasenovac camp at a ceremony on 9 October 1942, and also boasted: \"We have slaughtered here at Jasenovac more people than the Ottoman Empire was able to do during its occupation of Europe.\"\nBounded by rivers and two barbed-wire fences making escape unlikely, the Jasenovac camp was divided into five camps, the first two closed in December 1941, while the rest were active until the end of the war. Stara Gradiška (Jasenovac V) held women and children. The Ciglana (brickyards, Jasenovac III) camp, the main killing ground and essentially a death camp, had 88% mortality rate, higher than Auschwitz's 84.6%. A former brickyard, a furnace was engineered into a crematorium, with witness testimony of some, including children, being burnt alive and stench of human flesh spreading in the camp. Luburić had a gas chamber built at Jasenovac V, where a considerable number of inmates were killed during a three-month experiment with sulfur dioxide and Zyklon B, but this method was abandoned due to poor construction. Still, that method was unnecessary, as most inmates perished from starvation, disease (especially typhus), assaults with mallets, maces, axes, poison and knives. The \"srbosjek\" (\"Serb-cutter\") was a glove with an attached curved blade designed to cut throats. Large groups of people were regularly executed upon arrival outside camps and thrown into the river. Unlike German-run camps, Jasenovac specialized in brutal one-on-one violence, such as guards attacking barracks with weapons and throwing the bodies in the trenches. The infamous camp commander Filipović, dubbed \"fra Sotona\" (\"brother Satan\") and the \"personification of evil\", on one occasion drowned Serb women and children by flooding a cellar. Filipović and other camp commanders (such as Dinko Šakić and his wife , the sister of Maks Luburić), used ingenious torture. There were throat-cutting contests of Serbs, in which prison guards made bets among themselves as to who could slaughter the most inmates. It was reported that guard and former Franciscan priest Petar Brzica won a contest on 29 August 1942 after cutting the throats of 1,360 inmates. Inmates were tied and hit over the head with mallets and half-alive hung in groups by the Granik ramp crane, their intestines and necks slashed, then dropped into the river. When the Partisans and Allies closed in at the end of the war, the Ustashe began mass liquidations at Jasenovac, marching women and children to death, and shooting most of the remaining male inmates, then torched buildings and documents before fleeing.\n\nThe Ustashe viewed religion and nationality as closely linked; while Roman Catholicism and Islam (Bosnian Muslims were viewed as Croats) were recognized as Croatian national religions, Eastern Orthodoxy was deemed inherently incompatible with the Croatian state project. They saw Orthodoxy as hostile because it was identified as Serb. On 3 May 1941 a law was passed on religious conversions, pressuring Serbs to convert to Catholicism and thereby adopt Croat identity. This was made on the eve of Pavelić's meeting with Pope Pious XII in Rome. The Catholic Church in Croatia, headed by archbishop Aloysius Stepinac, greeted it and adopted it into the Church internal law. The term \"Serbian Orthodox\" was banned in mid-May as uncompatible with state order, and substituted it with \"Greek-Eastern faith\". By the end of September 1941, about half of the Serbian Orthodox clergy, 335 priests, had been expelled.\n\nUstashe propaganda legitimized persecution partly based on historical Catholic–Orthodox struggle for domination in Europe and Catholic intolerance towards the \"schismatics\". Following Serb insurgency provoked by Ustashe terror, killing and deportation campaign, the State Directorate for Regeneration launched a program in the autumn of 1941 aimed at mass forced conversion of Serbs. Already in the summer, the Ustashe had closed or destroyed most of the Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries and deported, imprisoned or murdered Orthodox priests and bishops. The conversions were meant to Croatianize and permanently destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Vatican was not opposed to the forced conversions. On 6 February 1942 Pope Pious XII privately received 206 Ustashes in uniforms and blessed them, giving symbolical support to their acts. On 8 February 1942 envoy to the Holy See Rusinović said that 'the Holy See joyed' over forced conversions. Cardinal Luigi Maglione, the Holy See secretary, encouraged the Croatian bishops in a 21 February 1942 letter to speed up the conversions, and also stressed that the \"Orthodox term\" be replaced with terms \"apostates or schismatics\". Many fanatic Catholic priests joined the Ustashe, blessed and supported their work, and participated in killings and conversions.\n\nIn 1941–42, some 200,000 or 240,000–250,000 Serbs were converted to Roman Catholicism, although most temporarily. Converts would sometimes be killed anyway, often in the same churches they were rebaptized. 85% of the Serbian Orthodox clergy was killed or expelled. In Lika, Kordun and Banija alone, 172 Serbian Orthodox churches were closed, destroyed, or plundered. On 2 July 1942, the Croatian Orthodox Church was founded in order to replace the institutions of the Serbian Orthodox Church, after the matter of forced conversion had become extremely controversial.\n\nMany Catholic bishops and priests in Croatia openly supported the Ustashe actions, and also, there were no condemnations of the crimes, public or private, by the Catholic hierarchy. The Croatian Catholic Church and Vatican in fact viewed policies against Serbs as advantegous to Roman Catholicism. Nevertheless, historian Tomasevich praised some of the public statements and deeds made by archbishop Aloysius Stepinac, but noted that there were shortcomings in statements and actions regarding genocidal actions against the Serbs and the Serbian Orthodox Church. In his diary, Stepinac said that \"Serbs and Croats are of two different worlds, north and south pole, which will never unite as long as one of them is alive\", along with other similar views. Croatia's rehabilitation of Stepinac in 2016 met negative reaction in Serbia and Republika Srpska.\n\nAn estimated 120,000 Serbs were deported from NDH to German-occupied Serbia, and 300,000 fled by 1943. The general plan was to have prominent people deported first, so their property could be nationalized and the remaining Serbs could then be more easily manipulated. By the end of September 1941, about half of the Serbian Orthodox clergy, 335 priests, had been expelled.\n\nDuring the war and during Tito's Yugoslavia, various numbers were given for overall war casualties. Estimations by Holocaust memorial centers also vary. As concluded by historian Rory Yeomans, the most conservative estimates put the lower number of 300,000 and possibly as many as 500,000 Serbs killed by Ustashe death squads, executed, or perished at concentration camps. Tomasevich said that the exact number of victims in Yugoslavia is impossible to determine. Sabrina P. Ramet estimated at least 300,000 Serbs \"massacred by the Ustaše\". Demographer Bogoljub Kočović, author of the most serious study of World War II victims in Yugoslavia, estimated 370–410,000 Serbs who died in NDH. The number of victims at the Jasenovac concentration camp remains a matter of debate, but current estimates put the number at around 100,000, about half of which were Serbs.\n\nIn Serbia and in the eyes of Serbs, the Ustashe atrocities constituted a genocide. Some Western and Jewish authors acknowledge it as a genocide, or, if not calling it explicitly \"genocide\", call Ustashe policies and acts \"genocidal\". R. Lemkin also called Hungarian and Bulgarian policies against Serbs genocidal.\n\nCatholic extremism was at the heart of Ustaše policy and this meant that many Serbs in the NDH were given the option of either converting to Catholicism or face deportation to a concentration camp. Serbs who refused to renounce the Orthodox Christian faith ultimately faced death in concentration camps across the NDH, especially at Jasenovac concentration camp. In the post-war era, the Serbian Orthodox Church considered that the Serbian victims of this genocide were martys. As a result, the Serbian Orthodox Church celebrates Holy New Martys of Jasenovac Concentration Camp on September 13.\n\nAfter World War II, most of the remaining Ustashe went underground or fled to countries such as Australia, Canada, the United States and Germany, with the assistance of Roman Catholic clerics and grassroots supporters.\n\nThe Yugoslav communist government did not use the Jasenovac camp as was done with other European concentration camps, most likely due to Serb-Croat relations. Tito's government attempted to let the wounds heal and forge \"brotherhood and unity\" in the peoples. Tito himself was invited to, and passed Jasenovac several times, but never visited the site.\n\nWith the Partisan liberation of Yugoslavia, many Ustashe leaders fled and took refuge at the college of San Girolamo degli Illirici near the Vatican. Catholic priest and Ustashe Krunoslav Draganović directed the fugitives from San Girolamo. The US State Department and Counter-Intelligence Corps helped war criminals to escape, and assisted Draganović (who later worked for the American intelligence) in sending Ustashe abroad. Many of those responsible for mass killings in NDH took refuge in South America, Portugal, Spain and the United States. Luburić was assassinated in Spain in 1969 by an UDBA agent; Artuković lived in Ireland and California until extradited in 1986 and died of natural causes in prison; Dinko Šakić and his wife Nada lived in Argentina until extradited in 1998, Dinko dying in prison and his wife released. Draganović also arranged Gestapo functionary Klaus Barbie's flight.\n\nIn the Croat diaspora, the Ustashe became heroes. Ustashe émigré terrorist groups in the diaspora (such as Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood and Croatian National Resistance) carried out assassinations and bombings, and also plane hijackings, throughout the Yugoslav period.\n\n\nSome Croats, including politicians, have attempted to minimise the magnitude of the genocide perpetrated against Serbs in the World War II puppet state of Germany, the Independent State of Croatia.\n\nBy 1989, the future President of Croatia, Franjo Tuđman (who had been a Partisan during World War II), had embraced Croatian nationalism, and published \"\", in which he questioned the official number of victims killed by the Ustaše during the Second World War. In his book, Tuđman claimed that fewer than thirty-thousand people died at Jasenovac. Tuđman also estimated that a total of 900,000 Jews had perished in the Holocaust. Tuđman's views and his government's toleration of Ustaša symbols frequently strained relations with Israel. Nonetheless, in his book, he did confirm that genocide happened:\n\nAn example of ultranationalist, anti-Serb sentiment in contemporary Croatian public life is Thompson, a Croatian rock band that has been protested against on numerous occasions for having sung Ustaše songs, most notably \"Jasenovac i Gradiška Stara\". People publicly displaying Ustaše affiliation at Thompson concerts in Croatia and elsewhere is a frequent occurrence, leading to complaints from the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\n\nIn 2006, a video was leaked showing Croatian President Stipe Mesić giving a speech in Australia in the early 1990s, in which he said that the Croats had \"won a great victory on April 10th\" (the date of the formation of the Independent State of Croatia in 1941), and that Croatia needed to apologize to no one for Jasenovac. Later on, Mesić apologized for his indecent statement and stated that he undoubtedly considered anti-fascism to be the basis of modern-day Croatia, appreciated Yugoslav Partisans and considered it necessary to \"reaffirm anti-fascism as a human and civilization commitment in the function of the unavoidable condition for the building of a democratic Croatia, a country of equal citizens.\"\n\nOn 17 April 2011, in a commemoration ceremony, Croatian President Ivo Josipović warned that there were \"attempts to drastically reduce or decrease the number of Jasenovac victims\", adding, \"faced with the devastating truth here that certain members of the Croatian people were capable of committing the cruelest of crimes, I want to say that all of us are responsible for the things that we do.\" At the same ceremony, then Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said, \"there is no excuse for the crimes and therefore the Croatian government decisively rejects and condemns every attempt at historical revisionism and rehabilitation of the fascist ideology, every form of totalitarianism, extremism and radicalism... Pavelić's regime was a regime of evil, hatred and intolerance, in which people were abused and killed because of their race, religion, nationality, their political beliefs and because they were the others and were different.\"\n\nIn 2008, in Melbourne, Australia, a Croat restaurant held a celebration to honour Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić. The event was an \"\"outrageous affront\" both to his victims and to any persons of morality and conscience who oppose racism and genocide\", Dr. Efraim Zuroff, of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, stated. According to local press reports, a large photograph of Pavelić was hung in the restaurant, T-shirts with his picture and that of two other commanders in the 1941–45 Ustaše government were offered for sale at the bar, and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia was celebrated. Zuroff noted this was not the first time that Croatian émigrés in Australia had openly defended Croat Nazi war criminals. \nIt is high time that the authorities in Australia find a way to take the necessary measures to stop such celebrations, which clearly constitute racist, ethnic, and anti-Semitic incitement against Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies.\n\nThe Ustaše had sent large amounts of gold that it had plundered from Serbian and Jewish property owners during World War II into Swiss bank accounts. Of a total of 350 million Swiss Francs, about 150 million was seized by British troops; however, the remaining 200 million (ca. 47 million dollars) reached the Vatican. In October 1946, the American intelligence agency SSU alleged that these funds are still held in the Vatican Bank. This matter is the crux of a recent class action suit against the Vatican Bank and other defendants.\n\nWorld War II and especially its ethnic conflicts have been deemed instrumental in the later Yugoslav Wars (1991–95).\n\nIsraeli President Moshe Katsav visited Jasenovac in 2003. His successor, Shimon Peres, paid homage to the camp's victims when he visited Jasenovac on 25 July 2010 and laid a wreath at the memorial. Peres dubbed the Ustaše's crimes to be a \"demonstration of sheer sadism\".\n\nThe Jasenovac Memorial Museum reopened in November 2006 with a new exhibition designed by a Croatian architect, Helena Paver Njirić, and an Educational Center, designed by the firm Produkcija. The Memorial Museum features an interior of rubber-clad steel modules, video and projection screens, and glass cases displaying artifacts from the camp. Above the exhibition space, which is quite dark, is a field of glass panels inscribed with the names of the victims.\n\nThe New York City Parks Department, the Holocaust Park Committee and the Jasenovac Research Institute, with the help of then-Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY), established a public monument to the victims of Jasenovac in April 2005 (the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the camps.)

In all he smuggled some 200,000 books for pupils, priests, teachers and peasants; he used several routes to pass through the Făgăraş Mountains.\n\nHe was born in Cârțișoara, present-day Sibiu County, the second child of poor peasants (Nicolae and Ludovica) who were former serfs, and he spent his childhood tending sheep at the edge of his village. In between his later brushes with fame, he would always return to this activity. He became the head of his family on 2 October 1865 with the death of his father.\n\nCârţan first crossed the mountains into the Romanian Old Kingdom with his sheep and a friend at the age of 18, and it was at that time that his interest in Romanian national unity became powerful. In 1877 he enrolled as a volunteer in the Romanian War of Independence, serving until 1881. In 1895 he travelled to Vác and Szeged to visit imprisoned Romanians, including the signatories of the \"Transylvanian Memorandum\". Badea Cârțan himself was arrested twice: once because he asked the Emperor-King Franz Joseph at Vienna for Transylvania's self-determination, and once because he asked the authorities for permission to sell Romanian books.\n\nCârțan made a journey on foot to Rome, and when he arrived at the city's edge after 45 days, said, \"\"Bine te-am găsit, maica Roma\"\" (\"Pleased to meet you, mother Rome\"). He wished to see Trajan's Column with his own eyes, as well as other evidences of the Latin origin of the Romanian people. After pouring Romanian soil and wheat at the column's base, he wrapped himself in a peasant's coat (\"cojoc\") and fell asleep at the column's base. The next day he was awakened by a policeman who shouted in amazement, \"A Dacian has fallen off the column!\", as Cârţan was dressed just like the Dacians carved into the column; the event was reported in Roman newspapers and Duiliu Zamfirescu, Romanian representative in Italy, showed him around the city and introduced him to its important personalities. This January-February 1896 trip was but one of three visits to Rome; on his last, in October 1899, on the occasion of a meeting of the International Congress of Orientalists, he laid a wreath at the column's base.\n\nCârțan also visited France, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Egypt and Jerusalem.\nHe was buried in Sinaia, on soil belonging to independent Romania (Transylvania still being seven years away from its post-World War I union with Romania); on the stone cross atop his grave is inscribed the phrase: \"\"Aici doarme Badea Cârțan visând întregirea neamului său\"\" (\"Here lies Badea Cârțan dreaming of the unity of his people\").\n\n", "id": "7701471", "categories": ["Romanian activists", "People from Sibiu County", "Romanian Land Forces personnel", "Shepherds", "Romanian military personnel of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)", "Prahova Valley", "1849 births", "Smugglers", "Austro-Hungarian emigrants to Romania", "1911 deaths", "Romanian Austro-Hungarians"], "title": "Badea Cârțan"}

He was a member of the Roman family of the Orsini.\n\nThe son of Girolamo Orsini and Francesca Sforza, he was grandson, on his father's side, of Felice della Rovere (illegitimate daughter of Pope Julius II) and Gian Giordano Orsini and, on his mother's side, of Count Bosio Sforza and Costanza Farnese, an illegitimate daughter of Pope Paul III.\n\nOn 3 September 1558 he married Isabella de' Medici, daughter of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, at Poggio a Caiano. Paolo Giordano lived mostly in Rome and his castle at Bracciano, rather than with his wife, who stayed mostly at Florence. In 1571 he took part to the battle of Lepanto. A year later, in October 1572, he served as a general of the Spanish infantry, in a campaign that tried to reclaim the garrison of Navarino in the Peloponnese.\n\nOn 16 July 1576 his wife died unexpectedly at the Medici villa of Cerreto Guidi during a hunting holiday. According to her brother, the grand duke Francesco I de' Medici, this occurred \"while she was washing her hair in the morning ... She was found by Signor Paolo Giordano on her knees, having immediately fallen dead.\" This official version of events was not generally believed, and the Ferrarese ambassador, Ercole Cortile, obtained information that Isabella was \"strangled at midday\" by her husband in the presence of several named servants.\n\nIsabella was the second sudden death in an isolated country villa in the Medici family, her cousin Leonora having died of a similar \"accident\" only a few days before. Most historians assume that Paolo Giordano killed his wife, in reprisal for carrying on a love affair with his cousin Troilo Orsini, or that he acted on instructions of Isabella's brother, the grandduke. One scholar, Elisabetta Mori, has argued that Isabella de' Medici died of natural causes and that the rumour that Paolo Giordano murdered her was spread by enemies of the Medici.\n\nAfter these events Paolo Giordano returned to Rome, where he started a relationship with Vittoria Accoramboni, wife of Francesco Peretti, the nephew of the future Pope Sixtus V. Peretti was assassinated, it was believed by Paolo Giordano's order, in April 1581. Wanted by both the Papal and Florentine police, Paolo Giordano took refuge in northern Italy, first in Venice and then in Abano and Salò with his mistress, whom he married on 20 April 1585. He died at Salò on 13 November 1585.\n\nOn 22 December Vittoria was herself assassinated by Ludovico Orsini of the Monterotondo line, on the instigation of Grand Duke Francesco. The Medici (Francesco and Cardinal Ferdinando) wished to secure movable assets in possession of Vittoria for their nephew Virginio Orsini, Paolo Giordano's son from his first marriage and principal heir.\n\n\n\n", "id": "7701476", "categories": ["1541 births", "Orsini family", "1585 deaths", "Dukes of Bracciano", "Condottieri"], "title": "Paolo Giordano I Orsini"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7701587", "text": "Ottobock\n\nOttobock is a German prosthetics company situated in Duderstadt. It has been responsible for several innovations in prosthetics, including the C-Leg, a computerized knee that adaptively varies its passive resistance to suit the patients' different walking gaits, and the Michelangelo Hand, a fully articulated robotic hand prosthesis. Ottobock has been a partner to the Paralympic Games since 1988, and an international worldwide partner to the International Paralympic Committee since 2005. In 2016, the partnership was extended until the end of 2020.\n\nOttobock was founded in Berlin as Orthopädische Industrie GmbH in 1919 by its namesake prosthetist, Otto Bock. It was created in response to the large number of injured veterans from World War I. Prostheses handmade by craftsmen could not keep up with demand. Bock's idea was to create components through industrial processes that could be supplied to prosthetists. This marked the beginning of a new industry. The political situation in post-war Berlin was unstable, and soon after the company was founded, it moved to Königsee in Thuringia. Over the following two decades, the company expanded to employ over 600 people.\n\nAfter World War II, Königsee lay within the Russian-occupied East Germany. The company property and assets there were expropriated in 1948. However, Max and Maria Näder, Bock's son-in-law and daughter, had established an office in Duderstadt in Lower Saxony, initially as a sales office for the zones of Germany occupied by the Western powers. In 1947, Max Näder became the managing director of the newly formed Otto Bock Orthopädische Industrie KG. Otto Bock died in 1953.\n\nThe company has been responsible for several innovations in prosthetics. As wood was in short supply in the early post-war years, it pioneered the use of polyurethane to manufacture prosthetics. Otto Bock Kunststoff was founded in 1953 to produce plastic prosthetics. By 2016, it employed 423 people and anticipated revenues of €127 million. Ottobock developed the pyramid adapter, a highly adjustable linkage for prosthetic parts. In 1997, it introduced the C-Leg, a computerized knee that adaptively varies its passive resistance to suit the patients' different walking gaits. It was the world's first fully microprocessor-controlled leg prosthesis system, and transformed the company into a vendor of highly complex mobility systems. The C-Leg was followed by the Michelangelo Hand, a fully articulated robotic hand prosthesis, and the mechatronic C-Brace orthotronic mobility system. Ottobock developed the waterproof Genium X3 knee in cooperation with the United States Department of Defense to allow amputee soldiers to return to duty.\n\nIn 1958, a US-based corporate headquarters was established in Minneapolis, Minnesota under the name Ottobock. In March 2014, the company announced it would relocate its North American headquarters to Austin, Texas. The logistics facility relocated to Louisville, Kentucky, and manufacturing moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. The US company was its first foreign branch. By 2016, it had branches in 45 different countries. Sycor was established as a wholly owned subsidiary in 1998. By 2015, it had 520 employees, and annual revenues of €66.7 million.\n\nProfessor Hans Georg Näder became head of the company in 1990. In 1992, after the Fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent German reunification, the Näder family re-purchased the land in Königsee that had been expropriated in 1948, and established a new wheelchair manufacturing facility and logistics centre there. A medical science centre () was built by the company in Berlin in 2009 to celebrate 90 years since its foundation. Max Näder died that year at the age of 94. By 2015, with a work force of 6,300 and annual sales of €771 million, the company was valued at €2.5 billion. In February 2017 Ottobock acquired BeBionic.\n\nOttobock has been a partner to the Paralympic Games since 1988, and an international worldwide partner to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) since 2005. The 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro was the 13th games at which it provided technical services. This involved shipping of equipment, including 250 items classed as hazardous good or dangerous chemicals, and 15,000 spare parts, including 1,100 wheelchair tyres, 70 running blades and 300 prosthetic feet, from Duderstadt to the port at Bremerhaven, by sea to Santos, and then by road to Rio de Janeiro. At Seoul in 1988, four Ottobock technicians carried out 350 repairs; in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, 100 technicians from 29 countries speaking 26 languages carried out 3,361 repairs for 1,162 athletes, including 2,745 repairs to wheelchairs, 438 to prosthetics, and 178 to orthodics.\n\nBy 2016, Ottobock was the IPC's longest-serving partner. In Rio on 10 September, the IPC's president, Sir Philip Craven, announced that Ottobock had agreed to extend its world-wide partnership to the end of 2020, encompassing the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo.\n\n", "id": "7701587", "categories": ["Medical technology companies of Germany", "Bionics", "Prosthetic manufacturers"], "title": "Ottobock"}

The lyrics open with the image of a child sleeping \"in the glow of [a] Donald Duck light\", a reference to Waters' prior song \"The Tide Is Turning.\" Waters goes on to ask why a culture whose primary concerns are luxury, consumption and petty values would \"kill the child\". The song ends with a plea to protect children from the crusade-waging \"bigots and bully boys / Slugging it out in the yard.\"\n\nThe second track of the single runs at 12 minutes and 29 seconds. Most of the song's lyrics are derived from a short story about Waters' hitchhiking excursion in Lebanon when he was a teenager. These passages, intoned in monologue over a descending synthesizer ostinato, are interspersed with more recently penned refrains outlining Waters' reaction to United States and United Kingdom involvement in the Iraq War. Waters performed the song at every show on his The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour, replacing the spoken-word recitation with a visual backdrop of the story as a graphic novel.\n\nWaters' condemnation of George W. Bush (at one point, the song's lyrics claim \"that Texas education must have fucked [him] up\") received negative reactions from audience members during his show at New Jersey's PNC Bank Arts Center on 6 September 2006, at Madison Square Garden in New York City on 12 September 2006 and in Tampa, Florida on 19 May 2007; however, audience reactions during the 5 October 2006 performance at the Hollywood Bowl were overwhelmingly positive, with many patrons rising to their feet and cheering. The song also received a positive reaction during its American performances at the Boston, Massachusetts and Camden, New Jersey Tweeter Centers, in New York on 30 May 2007, as well as in other cities worldwide, particularly Mumbai and Dubai. Ironically, during his first show in Dallas, Texas on 2 May 2008, the line referring to George Bush and the Texas education was met with uproarious applause. His last show on the American leg of the tour, in Houston on the 4th, was met with a fairly mixed reaction.\n\nWhile many fans have embraced the song's lyrical content, which is sympathetic towards the people of Lebanon, some have objected to Waters' political stance. In 2006, Waters performed a concert in Neve Shalom, Israel in front of a crowd of 50,000. During the concert, which included \"Leaving Beirut\" in the set-list, Waters expressed his belief that Israel had to \"tear down the walls\" of the Israeli West Bank barrier (pictured in the single's cover art) to make peace with its neighbours. The morning after Waters' concert in Neve Shalom, editorial writer Ben Dror Yemini wrote in the Israel newspaper \"Maariv\":\n\nThe song has also received some criticism for its musical content and style; one review of the 10 October show at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California claimed that the song \"floundered\" musically despite being lyrically \"one of Waters' best post-Floyd works.\"\n", "id": "7701622", "categories": ["Songs about cities", "2004 songs", "Songs about Lebanon", "Songs based on actual events", "Songs written by Roger Waters", "Anti-war songs", "Protest songs", "Songs of the Iraq War", "2004 singles", "Songs critical of religion", "Roger Waters songs"], "title": "To Kill the Child/Leaving Beirut"}

He is now honored as one of the Roman Catholic Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.\n\nHe was born at Dimples Hall, Garstang, Lancashire, the son of Robert Plessington, a Royalist Roman Catholic, and Alice Rawstone, a family thus persecuted for both their religious and political beliefs. He was educated by the Jesuits at Scarisbrick Hall, then at the Royal College of Saint Alban at Valladolid, Spain, and then at Saint Omer Seminary in France. He was ordained in Segovia, Spain, on 25 March 1662. He returned to England in 1663 ministering to covert Catholics in the areas of Holywell and Cheshire, often hiding under the name John Scarisbrick. He was also tutor at Puddington Old Hall near Chester. Upon arrest in Chester during the Popish Plot scare caused by Titus Oates, he was imprisoned for two months, and then hanged, drawn and quartered for the crime of being a Catholic priest. From the scaffold at Gallow's Hill in Boughton, Cheshire, he spoke the following:\nPlessington was beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI, and canonized and made one of the Forty Martyrs on 25 October 1970 by Pope Paul VI.\nThere is now a school called St. John Plessington in England which won TES School of the Year 2010 out of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland.\n\nThere is a memorial tablet to him located in the entrance porch of St Werburgh's Catholic Church, Grosvenor Park Road, Chester, just a short distance from the spot he was executed on. In 1980 his name was added to the base of the granite obelisk nearby that was erected in 1898 for the Protestant martyr George Marsh in Boughton, which has the following inscription:\n\nIn the early 21st century, a set of human bones found in an old trunk in Wales came to be regarded as possibly being Plessington's remains. They had been found in the late 19th century, wrapped in 17th-century clothing, in a pub in Holywell, Flintshire, which had been known to be a secret gathering place for the Catholics of the region to worship covertly. This had been the region where he had carried out his ministry before his arrest. Showing signs of violence, the bones had been considered those of some anonymous martyrs of the period and entrusted to a community of the Society of Jesus in nearby Tremeirchion.\n\nWhen a grave believed to have been Plessington's was opened in 1962 as part of the process for his beatification, it was found to contain the remains of a younger man. Interest later focused on this set of remains. In 2015, Mark Davies, Roman Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury, started a campaign to raise the funds for the testing of the DNA of the bones.\n\n", "id": "7701631", "categories": ["Executed people from Lancashire", "17th-century English Roman Catholic priests", "People executed by Stuart England by hanging, drawing and quartering", "1679 deaths", "1630s births", "People from Garstang", "Martyred Roman Catholic priests", "Forty Martyrs of England and Wales", "17th-century Christian saints", "17th-century Roman Catholic martyrs"], "title": "John Plessington"}

How he finds himself riding his fortune to becoming one, while struggling to sustain his relationships, forms the story. The film was released on 30 January 2009, supported by positive reviews from critics, but was a box office average.\n\nYoung actor Vikram Jaisingh (Farhan Akhtar) arrives in Mumbai to make it as a Bollywood film star with the help of Abhimanyu (Arjun Mathur), an actor friend from his hometown, and their mutual friend Sameer, who works in a studio props department.\n\nVikram befriends Abhimanyu's neighbor, young actress Sona Mishra (Konkona Sen Sharma), with whom he eventually becomes romantically involved. Sona, the mistress of small-time producer Satish Chowdhury (Alyy Khan), who for three years has promised her a leading role in his dream project, meanwhile works in regional films and bit parts.\n\nSona finds out that Satish has secured financing for the new project and meets him expecting him to cast her as second heroine, but he refuses to say that they need a new face and since she has acted in many regional films and other small roles she is no longer a fresh face. She argues that she can act well but he says that is not a major criterion these days in Bollywood. Sona is crying when Satish's wife enters and asks her why she is crying. Sona answers by fabricating a lie about trouble at home to save both her and Satish's embarrassment. Sona while leaving the both of them gives photos of Vikram to Satish who shows it to his wife and who in turn shows them to Romy (Rishi Kapoor).\n\nVikram is shortlisted for Romy's new movie. Neena (Dimple Kapadia), the mom of Nikki (Isha Sharvani), the actress cast for the movie, was a big film actress in the heyday. She sees Vikram's audition and tries to remember where has she met him before. Vikram had once approached her at a film fraternity party. Vikram is told his audition was for the lead in the film and that Neena has seen his audition. At home, he sees every movie Neena has starred in and he impresses her with his charm and knowledge about her work. Recalling past advice, Vikram successfully boosts a competing actor's ego whose overconfident acting is rejected by the director. Finally, Vikram is selected by Neena, Ranjit (director of the film Sanjay Kapoor), and Romy's wife (Juhi Chawla), despite Romy's desire to cast the other macho, hunky actor.\n\nOn set, Vikram becomes increasingly crafty and manipulative, while Nikki is smitten by him and sneaks into his room one night while her mother is asleep in an attempt to seduce him. Vikram succumbs to her advances and a secret affair starts between the two; the affair becomes stronger when Neena has to leave the set on business for a few days. Vikram tells Nikki he has no girlfriend. Meanwhile, Sona arrives at the hotel where the cast is staying to surprise Vikram. Her friend who is also working on the film warns her of a blossoming romance between Vikram and Nikki. Since Vikram has stayed in touch with her, Sona doesn't take heed of her friend's warning but discovers the truth when she sees Vikram's unexpectedly cold behavior towards her. Hurt, she leaves the hotel. After coming back, Neena instantly recognizes that something is going on between them and makes them understand that it will be mutually beneficial not to let the press and public know of their intimacy.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mumbai, news of the affair has leaked and a friend of Sona who works at a tabloid is assigned to prepare the article, which describes Vikram as a user who has shot to stardom by manipulating Neena and her daughter Nikki. The article also mentions details of when he was struggling to land a role and Sona's part in his life as the forgotten girlfriend. Neena gets very upset and yells at the magazine editor and tells Nikki to stay away from Vikram. Vikram and Nikki have a fight, and Vikram shows his frustration to Sona as he believes she is the one responsible for the article.\n\nEventually the film is released and it becomes a hit. Vikram rises to stardom but at the expense of his friends. At a party, he meets his idol Shah Rukh Khan, who advises him to not fall into the trappings of stardom and to always stay close to the people who stood by him when he was a nobody. He tries to get back with Sona, but she points out that he only wants to be with her because he is selfish and feels guilty. She refuses and walks out of his life. Sona soon gets good roles on television and is interviewed by a reporter for her fan following. The film ends with her telling the reporter that she is happy living the life of an independent and somewhat successful actress instead of being upset about not becoming a major movie star.\n\n\n\nZoya Akhtar said in an interview that she wrote the first draft seven years ago while relaxing on Palolem beach in Goa. In an interview she said:\nI hand wrote it and it was some ridiculous, epic-length when I came back and transcribed it on my laptop. The first film is the easiest to write because it's usually what the person knows their personal graphs, milieu and feelings. \"Luck By Chance\" is not about established actors, but those who are waiting for things to happen. Farhan's character is fresh off the boat, while Konkana's does bit roles, looking for a big break.\n\nThe production team went through a host of names, like Madhuri Dixit, Saif Ali Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Kajol Devgn, and Tabu. Having seen a lot of struggling actors come to Mumbai to make a living out of Bollywood, Zoya found it was easy to write the script for the film without any research. She was inspired to write this movie by a lot of Bollywood-inspired movies like \"Guddi\", \"Rangeela\", and \"Om Shanti Om\".\n\nJaved Akhtar wrote the dialogues for the film, incorporating, as Zoya puts it, his bizarre sense of humour. Farhan had to reportedly train to get six pack abs for the film. He was trained by Cheetah Yagnesh, who appeared on the film as Farhan's character's trainer.\n\nFilming faced a lot of problems, including the unpredictable Mumbai rains, which halted a song shoot with Hrithik Roshan. The rains washed out the entire set, and eventually the entire tent began to leak. Zoya was afraid that this would lead to short-circuit, and so all the lights had to be switched off.\n\nAccording to Farhan, principal photography for the film was completed in October.\n\nZoya Akhtar cast her brother Farhan to play the lead role after it was suggested to her by director Reema Kagti. She became convinced after seeing Farhan's performance in \"The Fakir of Venice\". She said in an interview, \"Farhan was the perfect choice for the role in \"Luck By Chance\" because he knows the industry in and out. He is smart and bright and both of us have been working together for years\". Problems arose with the huge casting of the film. Zoya said, \"I had to really think it out when I was deciding on these multiple actors that I wanted in the film. It was tough to decide especially because I wanted the right actors who could play themselves and still look believable as part of the film. Then there are other good actors like Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla, who are playing characters in the film\". Next to be cast were her parents, Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi, along with such veteran stars as Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia. Zoya said, \"We could have had Shabana (Azmi) as the diva, but I needed a mainstream heroine. Only a leading lady would do. Dimple has played it edgy. She's all warm, soft sunshine and then there's a flip and she's hard, cold, steely\". Isha Sharvani teams up again with Hrithik Roshan after appearing together in an ad. Juhi Chawla joined the cast playing Minty, the wife of producer Rommy Rolly.\n\nThe producers decided to go with subtle promotion, letting audiences explore the film by themselves. The main trailer for the movie was released in the last week of December. It introduced the main characters and set the pace for what the plot was about. \"BigFlix\", a part of Reliance BIG Entertainment Ltd., was given the task of promoting the movie. The first bit of promotion came from the music wherein winners were given signed albums by Farhan Akhtar and Konkona Sen Sharma. They promoted the whole movie across the nation in all 112 stores in 10 cities as well to the international audiences through its video-on-demand (VOD) site. The pre-release promotional activities included online marketing and publicity of the film’s music videos, trailers, downloads, previews, preview shows, contests and continued with other promotional activities post-release like meet-and-greet events with the star cast at select cities.\n\nA unique promotional campaign was launched by producers Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani called \"Auto By Chance\". They introduced 10 \"Auto by Chance\" three-wheelers in suburban Mumbai suburbs that would transport people for free to the destination of their choice in the suburbs. The promotion was run in conjunction with Big FM radio station and Godrej. One passenger would be interviewed live by an RJ and go on air with his experience of getting lucky and enjoying the free ride. The Indian gaming portal \"Zapak.com\" created a microsite for the movie with a game, \"Luck by Chance - Lucky Break\".\n\nThe movie was initially scheduled to be released 23 January 2009, alongside \"Raaz - The Mystery Continues\", but was pushed to 30 January. \"Luck by Chance\" was released on 900 screens worldwide in 27 countries. Of this, over 700 screens were in India and the rest were in overseas markets such as the United States, Canada, UK, UAE, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand.\n\nThe film was well received by critics, Anupama Chopra of \"NDTV\" wrote, \"Zoya pokes fun at Bollywood but she does it with a great affection. There are some lovely little moments like the star daughter in a super short skin-tight outfit struggling to touch her producer's feet without splitting a seam. But what makes \"Luck By Chance\" compelling is the layers beneath the laughs. Though the first half wobbles precariously as the script struggles to find a momentum, but thankfully the narrative flows better in the latter half and culminates in a satisfying, bittersweet end\". In the review at \"UAE Daily\" the United Arab Emirates reviewer said, \"One of the prime reasons why \"Luck By Chance\" works is because [of] the writing...Right from the characters, to the individualistic scenes, to the way Zoya puts them in a sequence, \"Luck By Chance\" is easily one of the most cohesive scripts this side of the Atlantic. If Zoya's writing is superb, her execution of the written material deserves distinction marks\". \"The Times of India\" said, \"\"Luck By Chance\" highlights how the film industry give regards to everything else but the story when making a movie and ironically weaves a fascinating story using that paradox\". Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL.in cited some drawbacks and said, \"Luck By Chance provides you some smiles throughout the movie. However, it fails to leave you with the content smile that a feel-good movie ideally aims to do.\"\n\nThe movie achieved 71 percent positive rating, by seven critics, on the aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes. Neil Genzlinger of \"The New York Times\" said, \"It might seem as if Bollywood couldn't possibly satirize itself — the genre is already so over-the-top — but Zoya Akhtar manages the trick deftly in \"Luck by Chance\"...A fabulous circus-theme musical number pulls out all the stops, but a scene in which an acting teacher explains why Hindi stars have to be more talented than those in Hollywood is a subtle comic gem\"...[I]t is Mr. Akhtar whose understated performance holds together this far-ranging, cameo-filled film. He manages to remain sympathetic even while wreaking romantic havoc\". Frank Lovece of \"Film Journal International\" characterized it as, \"\"The Player\" meets \"All About Eve\" in this seriocomic satire of the Bollywood film industry by a first-time director whose collaring of over a dozen major Hindi stars for cameos speaks well of its biting accuracy\", while Kyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" found it \"gently humorous\" and \"almost totally lacking in the cynicism, self-hatred and ennui that characterizes inside-Hollywood flicks\".\n\nThe movie had a slow start at the box office and registered 25% to 30% attendance. According to trade analyst and critic Joginder Tuteja, the occupancy at the theatres came down to 50%. Outside India, the movie failed to perform per expectations.\n\nIn the US, \"Luck by Chance\" debuted at number 32. In its opening weekend, it collected $217,439 (approximately Rs. 1.06 crores) on 61 screens, a per-screen average of $3,556. In the UK, \"Luck By Chance\" debuted at number 21 and collected £73,822 (approximately Rs. 50.95 lacs) on 50 screens, with a per-screen average of £1,476. The movie did poorly in Australia and was a flop in India, grossing $3,914,500 at the box office. Worldwide, the film grossed $4,504,365.\n\n", "id": "7701711", "categories": ["Films directed by Zoya Akhtar", "Directorial debut films", "Films about Bollywood", "Films about actors", "2000s Hindi-language films", "Films about films", "2009 films", "Indian films"], "title": "Luck by Chance"}

She was raised and educated in a humanist manner with her siblings, including Francesco de' Medici who succeeded their father as the Grand Duke of Tuscany. To secure a relationship with the powerful Roman Orsinis, Isabella's father arranged her marriage to Paolo Giordano I Orsini when she was 16. She remained in her father's household after her marriage, giving her an unusual degree of independence for a woman of her period. Following the death of her father, Isabella was probably murdered, with the complicity of her husband and brother, and in retribution for her relationship with Paolo Giordano's cousin Troilo Orsini.\n\nIsabella was born in Florence where, with her brothers and sisters, she lived first in the Palazzo Vecchio and later in the Palazzo Pitti, spending much of her time as a child at father's ancestral country home, Villa di Castello. The Medici children were educated at home by tutors in a range of subjects such as classics, languages, and arts. From an early age Isabella showed a great love for music, which in her adulthood she used as means for self-expression, according to biographer Caroline Murphy. A great beauty, she had a lively, high-spirited and impulsive character that was commented on by courtiers.\n\nIn 1553, at age 11 Isabella was betrothed to 12-year-old Paolo Giordano Orsini, in line for the Duchy of Bracciano in southern Tuscany, a liaison Isabella's father felt necessary to secure his southern border and his relationship the ancient Roman Orsini family. The two married in 1558, in a semi-private ceremony, at Villa di Castello. Paolo left the following day. Concerned by the spending habits of his new son-in-law, Cosimo decided to keep his daughter and her 50,000 scudi dowry in Florence, giving her greater freedom and control over her own affairs than was customary for Florentine women of the time. \n\nFollowing her mother's death, she acted as first lady of Florence for a time, displaying the de' Medici aptitude for politics. She suffered several miscarriages and remained childless until her late twenties. Her daughter Francesca Eleonora (known as Nora), was born in 1571 and eventually married her cousin Alessandro Sforza. Her son Virginio was born in 1572 and eventually inherited his father's dukedom. \n\nIsabella's free-spirited personality created rumours with regard to the nature of her relationship with Troilo Orsini, Paolo Giordano's cousin, who was charged with looking after her while her husband tended to military duties. \n\nOn 16 July 1576 Isabella died unexpectedly at the Medici villa in Cerreto Guidi during a hunting holiday. According to her brother, the grandduke, this occurred \"while she was washing her hair in the morning ... She was found by Signor Paolo Giordano on her knees, having immediately fallen dead.\" However, the official version of events was not generally believed, and the Ferrarese ambassador, Ercole Cortile, obtained information that Isabella was \"strangled at midday\" by her husband in the presence of several named servants. Isabella was the second sudden death in an isolated country villa in the Medici family, her cousin Leonora, having died of a similar \"accident\" only a few days before. Most historians assume that Paolo Giordano killed Isabella, in reprisal for carrying on a love affair with Troilo Orsini, or that he acted on instructions of the Grandduke Francesco, Isabella's brother. One scholar, Elisabetta Mori, has argued that Isabella de' Medici died of natural causes and that the rumour that Paolo Giordano murdered her was spread by enemies of the Medici.\n\nVarious paintings are extant, by Alessandro Allori (see above). Another painting with a right profile, also attributed to Allori, is owned by the Carnegie Museum of Art and has been uncovered and refurbished in 2014, having had a Victorian era face painted over.\n\n", "id": "7701773", "categories": ["1576 deaths", "People from Florence", "1542 births", "Assassinated Italian people", "16th-century Italian nobility", "Tuscan princesses", "House of Medici"], "title": "Isabella de' Medici"}

Busse Forest Preserve (Busse Woods) was named for Cook County Commissioner William Busse in 1949.\n\nBusse Woods, the heart of the forest preserve, is a mature Great Lakes hardwood forest. A segment of the woods, the Busse Forest Nature Preserve, is listed as a national natural landmark as a surviving fragment of \"flatwoods\", a type of damp-ground forest formerly typical of extremely level patches of ground in the Great Lakes region. Parcels of land with slow rates of precipitation runoff into adjacent wetlands and streams were likely to develop into flatwoods. A flatwoods forest is characterized by red maple, swamp white oak, and black ash trees. The black ash trees of Busse Woods are threatened by the emerald ash borer, which was reported in Illinois for the first time in 2006.\n\nOther parts of Busse Woods are better-drained and include species more typical of the forests of northern Illinois, such as the basswood, hickory, sugar maple, and white oak, the latter species being the state tree of Illinois.\n\nThere are of paved bicycle trail, the Busse Woods Trail, through the forest preserve: a loop and two spurs providing pedestrian and bicycle access to the preserve. In contrast to the natural area, the northwest and southwest quadrants of the preserve are dominated by \"Busse Lake\", a artificial reservoir that serves as a flood-control catchment for Salt Creek and by the tall skyscrapers of eastern Schaumburg.\n\nThe Friends of Busse Woods, a non-governmental organization, began operations in 2008. It cooperates with the Forest Preserve District of Cook County to oversee stewardship partnering operations at Busse Woods.

Formed in London in 1996, the band self-released their first EP \"Safety\" (1998) and their first single \"Brothers & Sisters\" (1999) before signing to Parlophone. Their first release for the major label was their second EP \"The Blue Room\" (1999). The release of the song \"Yellow\", followed by their debut album \"Parachutes\" in 2000, brought the band worldwide recognition and fame. The album, along with its follow-up, \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\" (2002), earned the band critical praise, widespread commercial success, and multiple Grammy Awards. The group's next album, the widely anticipated \"X&Y\" (2005), while considered inferior to its predecessor, was also a major commercial success, becoming the best-selling album worldwide in 2005. The three albums are among the best-selling albums in UK history. The group's next album, \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\" (2008), was co-produced by Brian Eno and was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the best-selling album worldwide of 2008, and earned the band three Grammy awards. The band's following albums, \"Mylo Xyloto\" (2011), \"Ghost Stories\" (2014) and \"A Head Full of Dreams\" (2015), each received mixed reviews but all topped charts worldwide. In 2018, the group released \"Global Citizen – EP 1\" under the name \"Los Unidades\", which featured contributions from Pharrell Williams, Stormzy, David Guetta and duo Stargate.\n\nSince their formation, Coldplay have credited all of their songs to all four members of the group. At the beginning of their career, Coldplay's music was described as post-Britpop, with the band Travis being one of their primary influences. The group also has an alternative rock style, said to be reminiscent of Oasis and Radiohead. The group's first album, \"Parachutes\", contained songs that showcased the group's indie rock side and songs characterised as dream pop. Compared to its predecessor, \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\" contained more piano-driven (\"Clocks\", \"The Scientist\") and guitar-driven songs (\"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\", \"A Whisper\"), as well as ballads (\"In My Place\") and lyrical themes that reflect love and relationships. Lyrically, \"X&Y\" is different to its predecessors, instead reflecting on singer Chris Martin's \"doubts, fears, hopes, and loves\". \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\" featured production by Brian Eno, who helped make the album musically different from its predecessors. The album contains lyrics dealing with death, loneliness and war, as well as sounds the band had never used before, such as orchestra, distorted guitars and more prominent percussion. \"Mylo Xyloto\", a concept album, tells a love story about two characters named Mylo and Xyloto; its songs dabble in pop, R&B and electronica. \"Ghost Stories\" featured the return to a more stripped-down melancholic style found in their earlier music, with lyrical themes of how the past informs the present and broken relationships. \"A Head Full of Dreams\" contained the overarching theme that there is a \"vast, beautiful world waiting to be discovered if you open your mind and live\", and featured numerous guest appearances, including Beyoncé, Tove Lo and Noel Gallagher. Coldplay have also recorded songs for several EPs, film soundtracks and tribute albums, and have recorded several unreleased songs.\n", "id": "7701849", "categories": ["Coldplay songs", "Lists of songs recorded by British artists"], "title": "List of songs recorded by Coldplay"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7701863", "text": "Orion abort modes\n\nNASA's Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle (MPCV) was planned as the first American spacecraft since Project Apollo to use an escape system in the event of a launch abort, something its predecessor, the Space Shuttle, had for only its first four orbital test flights in 1981–1982. Like the Apollo command and service module (CSM), the Orion CEV would use the launch escape system (LES), a solid-fueled tractor rocket that would be able to pull the Orion crew module away from a malfunctioning Space Launch System (SLS) rocket during the initial launch phase. Based on the launch escape system found on the Soviet/Russian Soyuz spacecraft, the LAS, designed and manufactured by ATK for the Orion CEV, would be larger than the Soyuz version and will have more thrust than the Atlas 109-D booster that carried astronaut John Glenn into orbit in 1962.\n\nThe earlier Apollo system had various abort modes depending on altitude, velocity, and other circumstances. Likewise the Orion will have similar modes of operation for its launch performance aborts. Some of these may not use the LAS itself, but would use the second stage of the Ares I, or even the Orion vehicle's own propulsion system (the Aerojet AJ-10 engine) instead.\n\nInitially designed to land on solid ground, like that of the early and current Soviet and Russian manned spacecraft (Vostok, Voskhod, and Soyuz), with a water landing as a backup, in August 2007, NASA tentatively redesigned the Orion for water landings (splashdowns) as the primary mode of landing, with ground landings as the emergency backup . Under the advice of the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) report, NASA will most likely develop abort procedures that resemble the abort procedures used on Apollo, but with some procedures carried over from the Shuttle.\n\nThe method of abort, either using the LAS or the second stage of the Space Launch System booster, depends on how far into the flight the spacecraft and crew are traveling.\n\nNASA has acquired several MRAPs to station near the launch pad, should there be time for the crew to evacuate the vehicle. One will be occupied by emergency rescue personnel, while the other will stand empty behind a blast shelter. Pad emergency egress enables astronauts and engineers to quickly escape the perimeter of the rocket. Both zip-lines and roller coasters were at one time studied for this purpose.\n\nDuring the first 120 seconds of flight, up to the jettisoning of the solid-fueled boosters at , the Orion crew module (CM) will separate from the rest of the rocket propelled by the LAS. Unlike the Apollo Launch Escape System, which used a pair of canards and the weight of the spacecraft to flip the vehicle over for landing, the Orion LAS has a set of steering rockets that will steer the spacecraft away from the malfunctioning SLS, as well as prepare the spacecraft for both separation and splashdown. The tower will then be jettisoned 14 seconds later and the hypergolic fuel on the Orion CM would be automatically released at a pre-determined altitude.\n\nAfter the LAS is jettisoned, the Orion crew and service modules (CSM) will separate as a whole from the SLS and either use its large AJ-10 engine or smaller control engines to maneuver from the rocket. Similar to a Space Shuttle trans-Atlantic (TAL) abort profile, the Orion will use the AJ-10 engine to propel the spacecraft to a desired separation point, in which then the Orion CM would land in either western Spain or Morocco on \"due east\" (i.e., lunar) flights, or in Ireland or the United Kingdom on ISS-bound flights. A splashdown in the eastern Atlantic Ocean would only be a contingency.\n\nThe SLS would propel the Orion CSM into an initial orbit, upon which the spacecraft will immediately separate, and then perform a retrofire that will allow the Orion CM to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the U.S. West Coast, or make a ground landing at either Edwards Air Force Base in California or White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico. This is similar in profile to the Shuttle's \"abort once around\" (AOA) profile.\n\nIf the SLS suffers less-than-ideal performance during the initial orbit insertion, it can be restarted 45 minutes later to place the Orion CSM into a less than ideal orbit that can be corrected with the on-board propellant reserves later in the flight. This is similar to the Shuttle's \"Abort To Orbit\" (ATO) profile, but depending upon the stable orbit reached, it may require NASA to end the mission with a landing at either Edwards or White Sands within a 24-hour period.\n\nThe four abort modes would also be used if the Max Launch Abort System (MLAS), a proposed alternative to the LAS, is flown in place of the LAS. The MLAS, which resembles the LAS, but without the Soyuz-like rocket tower, uses a strengthened boost protective cover, but with the main rockets placed inside of the BPC itself.\n\n\n", "id": "7701863", "categories": ["Constellation program"], "title": "Orion abort modes"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7701866", "text": "Hairy Hands\n\nThe Hairy Hands is a ghost story/legend that built up around a stretch of road in Dartmoor in the English county of Devon, which was purported to have seen an unusually high number of motor vehicle accidents during the early 20th century.\n\nThe legend of the Hairy Hands is set in Postbridge, Dartmoor. The road is now known as the B3212.\n\nAccording to the story surrounding them, the Hairy Hands are a pair of disembodied hands that appear suddenly, grab at the steering wheel of a moving car or the handlebars of a motorcycle, and then force the victim off the road. In some cases the hands are described as being invisible.\n\nSince around 1910, drivers and cyclists have reported suffering unusual accidents along the road between Postbridge and Two Bridges. In many cases, the victims reported that their vehicle had jolted or swerved violently and steered off the side of the road, as if something had taken hold of the wheels and wrenched it out of their control.\n\nIn most instances, the victims ran into a verge and survived. Their experiences remained a local curiosity, until June 1921, when Dr. E.H. Helby, the medical officer for Dartmoor Prison, was killed when he lost control of his motorcycle combination. Two young girls, children of the prison governor, who had been riding in the sidecar, survived. Several weeks after Dr Helby's death, there was another incident in which a coach driver lost control, injuring several passengers who were thrown out of their seats. Then, on 26 August 1921, an army Captain reported that a pair of invisible hands had taken hold of him and forced his motorcycle off the road, after which the story was picked up by newspapers in London and the story became known nationwide.\n\nIn \"Supernatural Dartmoor\" by Michael Williams, there is a story told by journalist and author Rufus Endle. He claimed that, while driving near Postbridge on an unstated date, \"a pair of hands gripped the driving wheel and I had to fight for control.\" He managed to avoid a crash and the hands disappeared as inexplicably as they had come. He requested that Williams not publish the story until after his death, for fear of ridicule.\n\nNot all reported incidents occurred in moving vehicles. In one incident, in 1924, a woman camping on the moor with her husband reported seeing a hairy hand attempting to gain access to her caravan during the night.

Recorded during the middle of 1977, \"It Begins Again\" was her first completed and released album since \"Cameo\" five years earlier. Two of the album's titles, \"Turn Me Around\" and \"A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Every Day)\", were tracks from the abandoned 1974 \"Longing\" sessions and Springfield decided to record new versions of both songs for \"It Begins Again\", placing Chi Coltrane's \"Turn Me Around\" as the opening track.\n\n\"It Begins Again\", which was Springfield's debut album for the United Artists label in the US and Mercury Records in the UK, was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Englishman Roy Thomas Baker, at the time best known for helping create the four first albums by Queen. Musically \"It Begins Again\" was however geared towards the American adult contemporary, pop and disco markets. Contributing on the album were some of the most renowned American session musicians of the era, such as Jay Graydon, Jeff Baxter, Joe Sample, Ed Greene and David Paich and it featured backing vocals by Pattie Brooks, Dianne Brooks and Brenda Russell – all acclaimed recording artists and composers in their own right. The songs on the album were also written by a number of notable composers and lyricists, among others Nona Hendryx, Lesley Gore, Ellen Weston, Dean Parks, Peter Allen and Carole Bayer Sager. Barry Manilow's \"Sandra\", often singled out as the highlight of the set, is a gentle piano ballad that portrays the life of a suburban housewife who minutely details her daily chores, all the while assuring both herself and the listener that \"\"I swear I love my husband and I swear I love my kids\"\" – yet in the last verse she reveals that she one day found herself cutting her wrists \"\"doing the dishes, quite by mistake. It was real touch and go for a while.\"\"\n\nContaining a diverse range of styles, \"It Begins Again\" was seen as somewhat experimental by Springfield herself, as well as music critics, who generally gave it favourable reviews. Despite the critical reception, the hopeful album title, as well as a series of promotional performances made in both the US and the UK promoting the up-tempo singles \"A Love Like Yours\" and \"That's the Kind of Love I've Got for You\", \"It Begins Again\" only briefly made the charts in Britain, peaking at No. 41, and did not chart in the US. Springfield stated that she had wanted to try something different, but felt that she now needed to move into a different style, a commercial, lightweight R&B, which resulted in the following album \"Living Without Your Love\".\n\nIn 2002, Mercury/Universal Music UK released the album on CD for the first time, then also including Tom Moulton's extended remix of \"That's the Kind of Love I've Got for You\", originally only released as a promotional 12\" single, which took advantage of the popularity of disco at the time. The song which was the closing track on \"It Begins Again\" was, however, the only true disco song on the album. The 12\" version was somewhat popular with US deejays and the track in fact managed to reach No. 31 in the US Hot Dance Club Play chart.\n\nWhen the Pet Shop Boys in 2005 released their instalment in the mix album series \"\" they both included a Dusty Springfield track, Neil Tennant chose her 60s classic \"Goin' Back\" – and Chris Lowe rather surprisingly the ballad \"I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love\" from \"It Begins Again\".\n\nSide A\n\nSide B\n\nBonus track 2002 CD reissue\n\n\n", "id": "7701908", "categories": ["Mercury Records albums", "1978 albums", "Albums produced by Roy Thomas Baker", "Dusty Springfield albums", "Albums arranged by Peter Matz"], "title": "It Begins Again"}

The network was owned by Diários Associados, who formed the Rede de Emissoras Associadas. Rede Tupi was founded and launched on September 18, 1950 by Assis Chateaubriand in São Paulo, initially broadcasting on Tupi Television Channel 3, whose first broadcast was on September 20 of that same year. Rede Tupi was later broadcast in 1960 on Tupi Television Channel 4 after the inauguration of TV Cultura (Culture TV), Channel 2, Rede Associada (Associated Network), and also a TV Station from Associadas. Their competitors were Rede Record, Channel 7, and Rede Excelsior (Network Excelsior).\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, TV Tupi was broadcast on Tupi Channel 6, and had its own station and studios there. In Brasília, TV Tupi was retransmitted by TV Brasília on Channel 6. In Salvador, TV Tupi was retransmitted by TV Itapoan, on Channel 5. Other TV Stations were formed by the Rede de Emissoras Associadas (Network of Associated Broadcasters), all Tupi affiliates and directly operated stations.\n\nNamed for the Tupiniquim tribe in Brazil, Rede Tupi was a pioneer in television programming in South America, setting the tone for the best dramas, news programming, sports, theater and entertainment in the 1950s and 1960s such as \"TV de Vanguarda\" (Vanguard TV), \"O Repórter Esso\" (The Esso Reporter), \"Alo Docura\", \"Clube dos Artistas\" (1952–80), \"Beto Rockfeller\", \"O Mundo e das Mulheres\" (The World for Women) and many more. It led the way for the establishment of television stations throughout Brazil, and in 1960, beat other stations in broadcasting via satellite (the first Brazilian TV network to achieve such a feat) in honor of the formal opening of Brasilia.\n\nIts success prompted other nations in the continent to have television stations. The network added new talent to Brazilian show business, which was then a thriving industry depending on movies and radio. During the 1960s its programs revolutionized television through animation, humor, comedy and children's shows plus the telenovelas that gave rise to the 1965 launch of its rival network in Rio de Janeiro, Rede Globo.\n\nTupi had its own mark in news: \"Rede Tupi de Noticias\" (Tupi News Network) became one of its successful broadcasts. The newscast was unique because it was broadcast three times each night. Ana Maria Braga was the main presenter. It had three sections: sports, local news and national/world news.\n\nIn 1964 it became Brazil's second television network to broadcast in color following Rede Excelsior in 1962. After its founder's death in 1968, the network, due to a crisis with its owners, transitioned itself becoming the first national television network in 1970, composed of its two main stations, Channels 4 and 6, its 7 other stations and 17 affiliate stations nationwide.\n\nTupi in 1972 joined other Brazilian stations in the move to full color TV broadcasts. On March 31 that very year Tupi's special program, \"Mais Cor em Sua Vida\" (More Color in Your Life) officially kicked off its color transmissions, and debuted a new logo in celebration, replacing the old number 6 logo used in Rio during its monochrome days.\n\nAfter 29 years of continuous broadcast Rede Tupi became defunct on July 16 to 18, 1980 when its two stations in São Paulo (Tupi Channel 4) and Rio de Janeiro (Tupi Channel 6) shut down, together with its 7 other stations nationwide, by order of the federal government of Brazil - a military dictatorship at the time. The Department of National Telecommunications did not approve the planned extension of Rede Tupi's television concession. The Rio station signed-off for the last time on midday of the 18th, following the other stations the previous day. The final days of broadcasts at the network's Rio de Janeiro studios (including the 18-hour long vigil) were covered by various networks in Brazil, including Rede Bandeirantes.\n\nTupi's São Paulo, Porto Alegre and Belém channels became the nuclei of SBT (Brazilian Television System, then TVS, TV Studios Channel 4) of the Grupo Silvio Santos (Silvio Santos Group) of Silvio Santos later in August 1981. Its Rio outlet became the nucleus of Rede Manchete (Manchete Network Channel 9), of the Bloch Editores (Bloch Editors) publishing group of Adolpho Bloch, in June 1983.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7701911", "categories": ["Diários Associados", "Portuguese-language television networks", "Television channels and stations established in 1950", "Brazilian television networks", "Articles containing video clips", "Television channels and stations established in 1980", "Defunct television networks"], "title": "Rede Tupi"}

The production of two-stroke-engines was ended, with the last F102s produced in March 1966, by when 52,753 or 53,053 had been produced.

The compound serves as a precursor to other organoruthenium compounds.\n\nThe cluster has \"D\" symmetry, consisting of an equilateral triangle of Ru atoms, each of which bears two axial and two equatorial CO ligands. Os(CO) has the same structure, whereas Fe(CO) is different, with two bridging CO ligands, resulting in C symmetry.\n\nRu(CO) is prepared by treating solutions of ruthenium trichloride with carbon monoxide, usually under high pressure. The stoichiometry of the reaction is uncertain, one possibility being the following:\n\nThe chemical properties of Ru(CO) have been widely studied, and the cluster has been converted to hundreds of derivatives. High pressures of CO convert the cluster to the monomeric ruthenium pentacarbonyl, which reverts to the parent cluster upon standing.\nThe instability of Ru(CO) contrasts with the robustness of the corresponding Fe(CO). The condensation of Ru(CO) into Ru(CO) proceeds via initial, rate-limiting loss of CO to give the unstable, coordinatively unsaturated species Ru(CO). This tetracarbonyl binds Ru(CO), initiating the condensation.\n\nUpon warming under a pressure of hydrogen, Ru(CO) converts to the tetrahedral cluster HRu(CO). Ru(CO) undergoes substitution reactions with Lewis bases:\nwhere L is a tertiary phosphine or an isocyanide.\n\nAt high temperatures, Ru(CO) converts to a series of clusters that contain interstitial carbido ligands. These include RuC(CO) and RuC(CO). Anionic carbido clusters are also known, including [RuC(CO)] and the bioctahedral cluster [RuC(CO)].

She served as the director of the National Museum of Costa Rica and endowed numerous professorial chairs in U.S. universities.\n\nBorn 1909 in New Orleans, Louisiana, Doris Zemurray was the daughter of Samuel Zemurray, aka Sam the Banana man, a Jewish immigrant who founded the Cuyamel Fruit Company the following year. He built the company into a successful venture, later famously selling it to the United Fruit Company giant in 1930 only to subsequently engineer a reverse takeover of sorts, serving as the latter's director in a profitable, if controversial, tenure from 1933 to 1952.\n\nIn 1917 Zemurray purchased and moved his family into a three-storey Beaux Arts mansion on St. Charles Avenue facing Tulane University, which would become the family home for the next four decades. In the early 1960s the mansion was transferred to Tulane where it became the residency of the University's presidents.\n\nDoris Zemurray attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she majored in anthropology, and also pursued graduate studies in archaeology.

These drugs cause an autoimmune response (the body attacks its own cells) producing symptoms similar to those of SLE. There are 38 known medications to cause DIL but there are three that report the highest number of cases: hydralazine, procainamide, and quinidine. While the criteria for diagnosing DIL has not been thoroughly established, symptoms of DIL typically present as muscle pain and joint pain. Generally, the symptoms recede after discontinuing use of the drugs.\n\nSigns and symptoms of drug-induced lupus erythematosus include the following:\n\nThese signs and symptoms are not side effects of the drugs taken which occur during short term use. DIL occurs over long-term and chronic use of the medications listed below. While these symptoms are similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus, they are generally not as severe unless they are ignored which leads to more harsh symptoms, and in some reported cases, death.\n\nThe processes that lead to drug-induced lupus erythematosus are not entirely understood. The exact processes that occur are not known even after 50 years since its discovery, but many studies present theories on the mechanisms of DIL.\nA predisposing factor to developing DIL is N-acetylation speed, or the rate at which the body can metabolize the drug. This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase. A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators. In addition, these patients had more hydralazine metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators. These metabolites (byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body) of hydralazine are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated, meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst. Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. These oxidants have been found to react with hydralazine to produce a reactive species that is able to bond to protein. Monocytes, one type of white blood cell, detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T helper cells, creating antinuclear antibodies leading to an immune response. Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and hydralazine are necessary to understand the processes involved in DIL.\nOf the drugs that cause DIL, hydralazine has been found to cause a higher incidence. Hydralazine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure. Approximately 5% of the patients who have taken hydralazine over long periods of time and in high doses have shown DIL-like symptoms. Many of the other drugs have a low to very low risk to develop DIL. The following table shows the risk of development of DIL of some of these drugs on a high to very low scale.\n\n\n\n\nAntinuclear antibodies are usually positive in drug induced Lupus. Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) can also be positive in association with certain drugs. Furthermore, Anti-Histone antibodies can also be positive in drug induced lupus.\n\nAnti-Histone antibodies are positive in up to 95% of patients with drug induced lupus. The most common medications associated with drug induced lupus are hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, methyldopa, chlorpromazine, quinidine, and minocycline.\n\nIt is important to recognize early that these drugs are causing DIL like symptoms and discontinue use of the drug. Symptoms of drug-induced lupus erythematosus generally disappear days to weeks after medication use is discontinued. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will quicken the healing process. Corticosteroids may be used if more severe symptoms of DIL are present.\n\n\n", "id": "7702007", "categories": ["Autoimmune diseases", "Systemic connective tissue disorders", "Drug eruptions"], "title": "Drug-induced lupus erythematosus"}

It was published by Faber and Faber on 19 October 2006. It consists of 19 sonnets, each named for a battle beginning with the letter B.\n\nIts name stems from the areas north and south of the equator in which sailing ships tend to be becalmed, and where sailors traditionally (and possibly apocryphally) threw horses overboard, to lighten the ship and conserve food supplies (see Horse latitudes). The title was previously employed by Doors singer Jim Morrison for a song on the \"Strange Days\" album.\n\nLike many of Muldoon's recent collections, \"Horse Latitudes\" contains a long poem – in this case a sonnet sequence ostensibly describing battle scenes through time and place. The collection also features several other characteristic features of Muldoon's work, such as fixed poetic forms and deft technique combined with a seemingly casual approach full of puns, slant-rhymes and wordplay. The collection is based on serious themes and emotions. Muldoon has reportedly said that the battle of Baghdad \"is implied by omission\", consistent with the themes of evasion, silence and censorship.\n\nThis collection contains the poem \"Sillyhow Stride\", written in memory of Warren Zevon.\n\nIn his review of \"Horse Latitudes\", James Fenton of \"The Guardian\" described the work as \"disconcerting\", and praised Muldoon for the \"brilliance of his verbal transformations\".\n\nJim McCue of \"The Independent\" described Muldoon as \"a good poet in the doldrums\", saying that after 48 trips to the dictionary he felt \"the book's erudition is for show, and wordplay stands in for meaning instead of standing up for it\".\n\nThe \"New York Times\" noted the clever and obscure references which Muldoon used to convey the anger and sadness in his poetry, and said \"the poem's weird levity only darkens the tone\". The review of Robert Potts in \"The Telegraph\" echoed this, saying the \"ludic nature\" of Muldoon's work \"has occasionally irritated less patient readers\" but that his \"fun does not preclude his seriousness\". Potts also praises Muldoon for his \"absolute control of pitch and tone, his slinky rhythms and winking jests\".\n\nThe Irish incarnation of \"The Independent\" said understanding Muldoon \"is often about as easy as to imagine \"Finnegans Wake\" outselling the \"Farmers Journal\"\", but added \"however much the subject-line veers, in the end it comes home, surprisingly enough, to simplicity and clarity\". Reviewer Brian Lynch mentioned the intensely personal subject matter of his family's cancer history and the juxtaposition between this and the battles through history. He concluded \"Muldoon more often than not manages by dint of skill to bring the private and public momentarily into balance, to achieve the calm associated with the oceanic standstill found at the latitudes of the title\".\n", "id": "7702021", "categories": ["Poetry by Paul Muldoon", "British poetry collections", "20th-century Irish literature", "2006 books", "2006 poems"], "title": "Horse Latitudes (poetry collection)"}

Nelson is a Seventh-day Adventist evangelist and author.\n\nHe has been the senior pastor of Pioneer Memorial Church on the campus of Andrews University since 1983. Before coming to Andrews University he served as a pastor in Oregon for ten years. He was the preacher for the Adventist satellite evangelistic series \"The NeXt Millennium Seminar\" in 1998. In 2004 he, along with former BBC News presenter Gillian Joseph presented a discussion-style series called \"Evidence: Through My Experience\" held at Newbold College, Berkshire. Later that same year he hosted another discussion series at Newbold College called \"Mind The Gap\". He hosted the television program \"The Evidence\" Nelson serves as adjunct teacher of homiletics at the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary at Andrews. He is the currently the speaker for a weekly television program, New Perceptions.\n\nBorn in Tokyo, Japan, of missionary parents, Nelson converses in Japanese. He attended the now-defunct Far Eastern Academy in Singapore and graduated from Southern Missionary College (now Southern Adventist University), Collegedale, Tennessee, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1973. He attended Andrews University where he received a master of divinity (MDiv) degree in 1976 and a doctor of ministry degree in 1986 from the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary. His books include \"Outrageous Grace\", \"Countdown to the Showdown\" and \"Built to Last\". In 1994, the Pioneer Memorial Church hosted ABC Television's National Christmas Eve service.\n\nNelson is married to Karen Oswald Nelson. They have two children.\n\nNelson was the speaker for the Adventist church's Net '98 evangelistic series. It was broadcast live October 9 to November 14, 1998, from Pioneer Memorial Church on the campus of Andrews University. It was broadcast in 38 languages and reached people in more than 100 countries at 7,600 sites, 2000 of which were in North America. He began preparing for the series nearly two years in advance. On opening night officials estimated that attendance around the world totalled 161,000 people. While Nelson preached upstairs in the main sanctuary of the church, downstairs in 38 cubicles, translators repeated his message in the various languages broadcast live around the world.\n\nAdventists usually present last day events and the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation in their evangelistic campaigns. Nelson says he intentionally chose to shift the focus from the apocalyptic to the relational because so many people lead lives of broken relationships. He chose the theme \"Finding a forever friendship with God.\"\n\nNelson writes predominantly for a Seventh-day Adventist church member audience and publishes with non-academic, Seventh-day Adventist church owned publishing houses.\n\n\n", "id": "7702025", "categories": ["History of the Seventh-day Adventist Church", "Seventh-day Adventist religious workers", "American television evangelists", "Southern Adventist University alumni", "Seventh-day Adventist administrators", "Living people", "American Seventh-day Adventist ministers", "Andrews University"], "title": "Dwight Nelson"}

He was the grandson of Rayees-ul-Waqt Hajji Mukhthar Shah Ashai.\n\nThe 'Ashai Bagh Bridge' over Nigeen Lake and Dal Lake is named after Ashai's ancestors. Before moving to suburban Srinagar, the Ashais lived at the 'Ashai Kocha' in Fateh Kadal, Srinagar. The historic Ashai mansion now hosts a Girl's high school. Ashai's hut in Raj Bagh has been converted into a hotel. Popularly known as \"Ashai Sahib\" by his colleagues, political contemporaries and subordinates, Ghulam Ahmad Ashai was the first Kashmiri Muslim to attain a bachelor's degree.\n\nIn reward for his service and academic achievements, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah appointed Ghulam Ahmad Ashai as the first Registrar of the University of Kashmir, both for academic and administrative matters, from 1948 to 1953. He led the first convocation of the University of Kashmir at Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir) Park and was followed by a distinguished panel including the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Pro-Indian Sheikh Abdullah. Ashai's involvement with Kashmir University started when he was appointed as the Special Officer assigned with the responsibility of starting Kashmir's first university. Ashai spent the next two years touring universities across India building up strategic ties and relations with renowned and established universities.\n\nIn the 1980 Sheikh Abdullah's National Conference government, in recognition of Ashai’s contributions as founding registrar designated the main road leading to the present university campus in Hazratbal as Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road.\n\nA commemorative plaque was installed at the entrance of the university, but it has since been removed. The family claims that illegal orders were given to have the plaque removed and the road christening annulled. However, according to official papers, the road is still legally named as \"Ghulam Ahmad Ashai Road\".\n\nAshai secured first class in the B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) examination of the Punjab University with the distinction of topping the list of candidates in 1915. He then gained his M.A. (Master of Arts) in Persian from Calcutta University. He obtained first division and was awarded His Excellency the Chancellor’s Gold Medal and the highest cash prize of Rs.200.\n\nHe gained his B.T. (Bachelor of Teaching) from the Punjab University. He also passed the Munshi Fazil Examination from the same university which earned him an additional degree of M.O.L. (Master of Oriental Languages). He successfully competed for the Senior Forest Service of the State of Jammu and Kashmir with distinction but opted out of it.\n\nGhulam Ahmad Ashai was married to Jana Begum, the only daughter of Khwaja Amir Shah of Varmul, a wealthy Kashmiri nobleman. Ahmad and Jana had ten children; four sons and six daughters. They lost their second daughter to a viral disease at age 7. Ashai’s children founded a charitable memorial trust at Kashmir in memory of their father on 26 August 2005.\n\n", "id": "7702053", "categories": ["Year of birth missing", "People from Srinagar", "University of Calcutta alumni", "Kashmiri people"], "title": "Ghulam Ahmad Ashai"}

Within one mile of three bordering cities on the southern end of San Bernardino (Redlands, Colton and Loma Linda), Inland Center is a single level mall anchored by Macy's, Sears, Forever 21, and JCPenney plus 110 specialty shops and services.\n\nOriginally constructed by Homart Development Company and opened in 1966, Inland Center Mall was built on top of the former Urbita Springs lake. The mall started off with three major anchor buildings, May Company, The Broadway, and Sears.\n\nThe mall experienced a number of changes in the 1990s. In 1993, the May Company store closed leaving the mall with only two anchors, The Broadway and Sears, which reduced overall traffic after merging with May Department Stores. In 1996, a fourth anchor building was annexed in front of the mall's main entrance, along with a four-story parking structure. The store was Robinsons-May. Later that year, Macy's bought out The Broadway, and converted its three-story building to a Macy's location. In 1999, Gottschalks moved into the old May Co building after it purchased The Harris Company and closed its store in the Carousel Mall (also located in San Bernardino) despite local efforts to keep Harris at their original location.\n\nIn 2000, the main entrances were renovated placing trees and benches at all entrances and a new mall sign along with a new remodeled Food Court next to Sears, where the old Miller's Outpost was located. In 2006, Macy's bought out Robinsons-May, and since having two anchors on the same property was redundant, decided to close the old Broadway building in favor of the more modern built Robinsons-May building at its current location.\n\nThe vacant Broadway building was sold to Mervyn's in 2007 for renovation and a proposed opening in September 2008, but the Mervyn’s company was liquidated around that time after filing for Chapter 7. Also in October 2008, construction was made to seal off the vacant and smaller second level of the mall to public traffic. In 2009, Forever 21 announced it would move into the vacant building that was partially renovated by Mervyn's. Gottschalks closed its doors in July 2009 after they too filed for Chapter 11 liquidation. JCPenney announced that they will open at the Former Gottschalks building.\n\nIn 2013, Macerich Corporation installed over 4,000 solar panels on the corridor rooftops to reduce their dependence on electricity during operating hours. EV Charging Stations were also installed in the parking lots at the major entrances. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Inland Center, into Seritage Growth Properties. In 2016, JCPenney opened a store in the former Gottschalks building.\n\nIn 2006, the original Macy's store which occupied a dated The Broadway location was closed and the more modern Robinsons-May was converted to Macy's as part of the Federated Department Stores merger with May Department Stores. Mervyn's was to take over the old anchor space but failed to open after their bankruptcy finalized in 2009.\n\nConstruction was also completed in 2007 to seal off the lower level, demolishing a staircase and glass elevator that took customers to the lower level of the mall that remained vacant after Oshman's Sporting Goods and the old video arcade closed down in prior decades. After construction was completed, the upper level floor was made solid and a Children's Play Area themed after US Route 66 was built near the old staircase location.\n\nOn January 2008, parking lots adjacent to the parking structure and a small portion of the underutilized western parking areas of the mall were used in the recent SANBAG and CalTrans I-215 expansion project. The Inland Center Drive overpass reopened next to the mall in April 2010.\n\nDuring 2009, two adjacent pads to Inland Center owned by Macerich corporation were razed and placed for sale: On North Mall Blvd. and E Street (Formerly a Citibank branch) and South Mall Blvd. and E Street (Formerly Buffalo Ranch Restaurant).\n\nA distinctive feature of Inland Center is the large cement vault in the center of the mall serving as its main entrance prior to 1988. The vault today serves as the walkway between Macy's and Forever 21 with smaller-format stores along each side and a perpendicular main walkway with full-size inline stores crossing the vault to reach Sears and JCPenney.\n\nThe mall currently hosts four anchors, the most recent being J. C. Penney. Upon opening in 1966, the mall contained Sears, The Broadway, and May Company. The two anchors aside from Sears both ceased to exist by 1995, being replaced by Macy's, Robinsons-May, and Gottschalks, respectively. By 2009, the mall had remained at two anchors due to the closure of the southern wing Gottschalks until the opening of Forever 21 at the Broadway building. Today, the mall's four anchors occupy the former tenants and remains as such.\n\n", "id": "7702063", "categories": ["Macerich", "Shopping malls in San Bernardino County, California", "Buildings and structures in San Bernardino, California"], "title": "Inland Center"}

Listed at , 170 lb., Gleason batted and threw right-handed. His older brother, Jack Gleason, was also a ballplayer.\n\nA St. Louis native, Gleason played amateur baseball for the St. Louis Stocks as early as age 16. He earned the nickname \"Brudder Bill\" because he was teammates with his older sibling, Jack Gleason, on several amateur and professional baseball teams. \n\nGleason entered the majors in 1882 with the St. Louis Browns, where he and Jack Gleason were the first siblings to play in the same major league infield. His most productive season came in 1887, when he posted career numbers in batting average (.288), runs (135), hits (172), and on-base percentage (.342). A member of three St. Louis champion teams from 1885 to 1887, in 1883 and 1885 he led the league in games played.\n\nDuring his time with the St. Louis Browns, Gleason was roommates with Charlie Comiskey. While Gleason was considered a gentleman off the field, he was loud and aggressive on the baseball diamond, often hurling continuous insults at opposing players or using his spikes on the basepaths to break up double plays. An 1885 \"Sporting Life\" article suggested that if Gleason broke a limb or his neck, \"not a ball player in the American Association would feel the slightest regret.\" \n\nAfter Gleason played for the Browns for six years, he joined the Philadelphia Athletics (1888) and Louisville Colonels (1889). In an eight-season career, Gleason was a .267 hitter (907-for-3395) with seven home runs and 298 RBI in 798 games, including 613 runs, 111 doubles, and 35 triples. Incomplete data shows him stealing 70 bases and getting hit by 52 pitches. \n\nGleason became an AA umpire in 1891, but his tenure lasted only one game. In Gleason's lone appearance, a game between the St. Louis Browns and Cincinnati Reds, King Kelly was the catcher and team captain of the Reds. With a tie game in the ninth inning, and with darkness setting in, Kelly told his Reds teammates to stall time. Gleason awarded a forfeit to St. Louis; the league fired him for the decision and the game was played again. \n\nGleason was a member of the St. Louis Fire Department during and after his baseball career. Late in his life, he was a captain with Engine Co. No. 28. In the summer of 1932, Gleason stepped on a nail at a fire, resulting in a foot infection. While recovering from that infection, Gleason tried to walk to a local drug store. He collapsed from heat exhaustion and was confined to bed for a few days before he died in his St. Louis home on July 21, 1932.\n", "id": "7702080", "categories": ["19th-century baseball players", "Washington Senators (minor league) players", "Baseball players from Missouri", "1858 births", "St. Louis Browns (AA) players", "Major League Baseball shortstops", "Sportspeople from St. Louis", "Minneapolis Browns players", "Philadelphia Athletics (AA) players", "Dubuque Red Stockings players", "St. Louis Brown Stockings (AA) players", "Louisville Colonels players", "Rockford Hustlers players"], "title": "Bill Gleason"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702085", "text": "Pharyngula (blog)\n\nPharyngula, a blog founded and written by PZ Myers, is hosted on ScienceBlogs (2005–2011, in full, and 2011–present, in part) and on FreeThoughtBlogs (2011–present). In 2006 the science journal \"Nature\" listed it as the top-ranked blog written by a scientist based on popularity. The blog addresses a range of topics, including Myers' academic specialty, biology. It has become particularly well-known for Myers' writing style (characterized by sarcasm) and for his criticism of intelligent design and creationism. In 2009, Hemant Mehta ranked \"Pharyngula\" the most popular atheist blog, based on subscriber levels and other factors.\n\nAccording to Alexa Internet, Pharyngula.org was started on June 19, 2002. It started out as an experiment in writing instruction for a class. Students were required to submit mini-essays to be published online. After the project was finished, Myers still had the web-publishing software, and started to use it personally. The blog is named after his favourite stage in embryonic development, the pharyngula stage. Pharyngula moved to hosting at ScienceBlogs in 2005.\n\nIn 2007, Myers reviewed Stuart Pivar's book \"Lifecode\", which argues that self-organization at the embryonic and fetal stages determines the development and final structure of organisms. Myers reviewed the book negatively, stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from Pivar's imagination and had no basis in actual evidence. After some discussion in the comments threads of \"Pharyngula\", Pivar sued Myers for libel. Within a week Pivar withdrew the lawsuit, stating that \"the real issue got sidelined\" and that his problem was more with Seed Media Group.\n\nIn June 2008, Myers commented on national press reports that a University of Central Florida student took a host (Eucharist wafer) from a Catholic Mass in response to forcible attempts to stop him from carrying it back to his seat, where he claimed he planned to show it to a fellow student who was curious about the Catholic faith. After death threats were directed against the student by some who were offended by the student's behavior, Myers composed his first blog post on the topic.\nAfter describing the harassment leveled against the student, he asked readers to acquire for him consecrated Eucharistic hosts, which he might \"show you sacrilege, gladly, and with much fanfare\" and could treat \"with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse, all photographed and presented here on the web.\" Bill Donohue's Catholic League responded with a letter demanding the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Legislature take action against Myers. Proponents of this action noted that Myers's blog could be reached from his university web page. Myers has received several death threats and much hate mail over the controversy.\n\nIn August 2011, Myers and others founded a new blog network, FreethoughtBlogs, to host \"Pharyngula\" and other blogs in the atheist/secular field. According to Myers, the move was made as an \"acceptable compromise\" between him and National Geographic, who at that time would be \"taking a more active role in hosting the ScienceBlogs stable\" and therefore \"bringing their standards & practices, which are different from the more freewheeling policies of Seed Media [and would cause] a culture clash\". Myers stated that \"NatGeo and I have worked out an acceptable compromise. This site on Freethoughtblogs […is not] in any way associated with National Geographic\" and that he would only cross-post to his original site on ScienceBlogs \"whatever I write that I feel is compatible with the more conservative ethos of National Geographic.\" As such, since August 2011, the complete Pharyngula has appeared on FreethoughtBlogs, and a limited selection of those posts – the more science-focused ones – are cross-posted to the ScienceBlogs-hosted version.\n\nIn September 2012, Myers announced that blogger and environmentalist Chris Clarke would become \"Pharyngula\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s co-author. Clarke left the blog in August 2013, partly because of the perceived unpleasantness of \"Pharyngula\" commenters \n\nMyers often criticizes intelligent design, creationism and pseudoscientific movements, and posts on subjects such as science, religion, politics, superstition, and education. His experience in evolutionary developmental biology and as a teacher provides depth to the subjects of science and education. One theme that arises regularly is that of cephalopods, creatures that Myers finds quite fascinating.\n\nIn particular Myers frequently offers specific criticisms of creationism, including intelligent design as well as the Discovery Institute, Answers in Genesis, and other groups that promote pseudoscientific ideas. For example, in February and March 2007, he focused many of his posts on creationist neurosurgeon Michael Egnor, who had recently joined the Discovery Institute. In addition to Myers' criticisms of Egnor's arguments on evolution and Intelligent Design, Myers criticized the Discovery Institute's reliance on someone whose expertise wasn't relevant to evolution.\n\nIn early April 2007, Myers participated in an April Fool's Day joke arranged by \"The Panda's Thumb\" which manufactured a website spoofing the Discovery Institute's page on which \"Egnor\" admitted that his association with the Discovery Institute was itself an April Fool's joke. This elaborate prank succeeded in fooling many of his readers, while others succeeded in spotting jokes in the design of the false Discovery Institute page and concluded that this admission was itself the prank. He made a point the following day that he perceived it as getting exceedingly difficult to believe some creationists were for real (cf. Poe's Law) and highlighted a quote by Stephen Meyer.\n\nIn June 2005, Myers criticized a cartoon by biblical literalist Jim Pinkoski which claimed that the Biblical line, \"There were giants in the earth in those days,\" (Genesis 6:4) was literally intended to convey that early humans were much taller than their modern counterparts. Pinkoski placed Adam at tall and Noah at tall. What Myers found most interesting about this cartoon, however, was the note on it which read, literally, \"NOTE: If you doubt this is possible, how is it there are PYGMIES + DWARFS ??\".\n\nMyers argued that the existence of pygmies and dwarfs now is a non sequitur when it comes to whether humans were tall 6,000 years ago. If Pinkoski's claims were valid, humans would perhaps continue to decrease in height and approach that small size at some time in the future, but this does not mean those small humans would exist now (barring the use of time travel, a claim Pinkoski never makes). Myers went on to mock the irrelevance of this argument with parodies such as:\n\n\nThe phrase has since been picked up by various bloggers to ridicule creationist arguments, and is also popular with commenters at \"The Panda's Thumb\". The phrase is generally capitalized and bolded to match how it originally appeared in Pinkoski's cartoon.\n\nMyers has voiced the position that many of the responses to Richard Dawkins' \"The God Delusion\" are what he calls \"Courtier's Replies\". Replying to critics who felt that Dawkins ignored sophisticated versions of modern theology, Myers compared them to courtiers fawning on the legendary emperor who had no clothes:\n\nIn other words, critics complain about Dawkins not studying aspects of theology that are irrelevant to whether or not God exists in the same way as scholarly writings about imperial fashion are irrelevant when the emperor is naked. Dawkins himself quoted the Courtier's Reply in a debate with Alister McGrath. He also referenced the Courtier's Reply in the preface to \"The God Delusion\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 2007 paperback edition.\n\nAnother recurring trope has been Myers' reaction to the label \"fundamentalist atheist\", bestowed by some upon him, Dawkins and others who espouse similar views. Myers writes,\nThe \"new atheism\" (I don't like that phrase, either) is about taking a core set of principles that have proven themselves powerful and useful in the scientific world — you've probably noticed that many of these uppity atheists are coming out of a scientific background — and insisting that they also apply to everything else people do. These principles are a reliance on natural causes and demanding explanations in terms of the real world, with a documentary chain of evidence, that anyone can examine. The virtues are critical thinking, flexibility, openness, verification, and evidence. The sins are dogma, faith, tradition, revelation, superstition, and the supernatural. There is no holy writ, and a central idea is that everything must be open to rational, evidence-based criticism — it's the opposite of fundamentalism.\n\nEventually, Myers summarized his stance by invoking \"Blake's Law\", named for \"Pharyngula\" commentator Blake Stacey. As formulated by Stacey in 2007, based in concept on Godwin's Law:\nIn any discussion of atheism (skepticism, etc.), the probability that someone will compare a vocal atheist to religious fundamentalists increases to one.\n\nMyers is strongly feminist and has written about discrimination against women.\n\nMyers has made frequent use of the phrase \"deep rifts\" to satirize perceptions that atheism could experience a religious schism over disagreements on marketing atheism or the role of science and religion. Myers does not deny there are some differences of opinion between prominent atheists, but contends this is a good thing and is attributed to the freethinking nature of atheism.\n\n\n", "id": "7702085", "categories": ["Criticism of intelligent design", "American blogs", "Science blogs", "Criticism of creationism", "Biology websites", "Scientific skepticism media"], "title": "Pharyngula (blog)"}

It was founded in 1874 by James White in Oakland, California, and is now located in Nampa, Idaho. Its titles include theological works as well as books on topics such as vegetarianism and home schooling. It owns its own printing operation. It is owned by the North American Division of Seventh-day Adventists.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church was formally organized and named in 1863. It began to realize its great mission to go into all the world and preach the gospel. Consequently, Elders J.N. Loughborough and D.T. Bourdeau came to California in 1866. And by May 1871, there were 130 Adventists in California in the San Francisco and Santa Rosa area.\n\nLate in 1872, James and Ellen White and their two sons, Willie and James Edson, came to California in the interest of the newly established work of the church on the Pacific Coast. Plans were laid for the establishment of a health institute and a branch publishing house. However, no funds were available, nor was a site yet secured.\n\nOne day while crossing the ferry from San Francisco to Oakland, Mrs. White through inspiration spoke to her husband. \"Somewhere in Oakland,\" she said, \"is the place to locate the paper.\"\n\nSo, in 1874, James White began to publish the \"Signs of the Times\" in Oakland. It was printed under the aegis of \"Elder James White, Editor and Proprietor.\" The date of the first issue, June 4, 1874. The subscription price \"$2.00 a year to all those able to pay the subscription price, and free to all others as far as the paper is sustained by donations of liberal friends of the cause.\" These were the terms.\n\nIn the fall of 1874 at a camp meeting in Yountville, the president of the California Conference, Elder Loughborough, presented the need of a publishing house to the people assembled. That day $19,414 was given in gold and in pledges. There were less than 500 members in the congregation.\n\nSoon, construction of a plant on Castro Street in Oakland began. This became known as the Pacific Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association. Equipment installed included a four-roller airspring drum cylinder press powered by an upright donkey engine, a paper cutter, a book trimmer, and some new type. Soon the Signs of the Times circulation had passed 4,000.\n\nBy 1887, the investment of Pacific Press had grown to $200,000, and the annual business totaled $150,000. From its beginning, the Press prospered. The press became well known on the West Coast for its quality work and prompt delivery of printing orders.\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the subscription list of Signs of the Times was nearly 50,000. Retail sales of the book department amounted to $94,000. However, commercial work continued to occupy an important place in production. At times, denominational work was set aside to accommodate the commercial. It was felt that commercial work was necessary to keep the machinery going and profits coming in.\n\nMrs. White encouraged management to move away from the city, which was developing so rapidly around the plant. The town of Mountain View wished to raise its status in the state. The town leaders, upon hearing that the Pacific Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association in Oakland, which had gained a fair and growing reputation, was looking for a more rural atmosphere in which to establish itself, offered the Press five choice acres of land as well as a pair of lots for a church or meeting house.\n\nThe Press accepted the offer of the of land, and in 1904 they moved to Mountain View. Along with the plant came the families. As a result, real estate in Mountain View began to advance, and area business grew.\n\nA brick building soon took shape on the land donated by the town, and work began to come in from customers who patronized the plant in Oakland. Mrs. White implored Management to rely on God alone and give up the commercial work that had followed them from Oakland and had received priority over church publications.\n\nAt 5:18 in the morning of April 18, 1906, a great earthquake convulsed the whole bay area. The walls of the plant crumbled. Its offices were in shambles. Yet, within a few days the presses were running again.\n\nOn July 20, three months after the earthquake, on a Friday about midnight, a fire of undetermined origin broke through the roof in the northeast corner of the photoengraving room. In two hours the entire building had become a blazing inferno. Although the fire was finally subdued, it was not entirely extinguished, and it broke out a second time. This time scarcely a charred board remained. The paper stock of the plant, finished books, type plates, manuscripts – all were destroyed.\n\nSuddenly, all the warnings of Mrs. White came to mind. Soon after the fire the Board of Directors stopped commercial work at the Pacific Press.\n\nIn 1955 ownership of Chapel Records was transferred from the Pacific Union Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists to Pacific Press Publishing Association.\n\nIn 1982, the press lost an appeal in a case against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission wherein the court denied that the press could obtain a Title VII exemption to the employment code that would allow them to treat male and female employees differently.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the cost-of-living index in the densely populated San Francisco Bay area made it almost impossible for young families to work at the plant. This, among other reasons, made it expedient to move the plant from Mountain View. In 1983, the Board of Trustees, along with the General Conference Committee voted that the plant be sold and a move made to another area.\n\nNampa, Idaho, was chosen as the location for the new plant. The new building contained of floor space. Relocation to Idaho began in June 1984 and was completed in the late winter of 1984-85.\n\nThe move to Idaho was an advantageous one. From the humble beginning in 1874 when the first Signs of the Times was issued, with Elder James White editing the paper, setting the type, and printing the pages, and with his son as a delivery boy, the institution has grown to become the employer of over 250 workers at a plant larger than three football fields and generating an annual income of over $40 million. Pacific Press is the largest bulk mailer in Idaho.\n\nIn 1994, Pacific Press began management of literature evangelist work with the establishment of the HHES (Home Health Education Services) Division. Currently, the HHES manages literature evangelist programs for Pacific Union, North Pacific Union, and Mid America Union.\n\nThe Retail Division for management of Adventist Book Centers was begun in 1996. The Division operated retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, and operated a bookmobile program in the mountain states region. In August, 2013, the Pacific Press board voted to return management of the stores operated by the Retail Division to the local Seventh-day Adventist conferences. Pacific Press closed the last of its Retail Division in the United States in the second half of 2014. Operations in Canada are expected to be closed by year end.\n\n\n", "id": "7702129", "categories": ["Companies based in Idaho", "Seventh-day Adventist media", "Publishing companies established in 1874", "Privately held companies based in Idaho", "Christian publishing companies", "Book publishing companies of the United States"], "title": "Pacific Press Publishing Association"}
